        It is the intent of the general assembly that the various counties and cities of the state that are members of the Chickasaw basin authority and within the designated area have the most effective and efficient means of organizing themselves on a regional basis for the purpose of general and comprehensive water resources planning and development activities to provide coordinated, efficient and orderly development of the surface water management plans and projects within the area as established by the Chickasaw basin authority programs and all approved amendments thereto. Such development includes all recreational and conservation developments adjacent to any water management project. It is the intent that local governments through the authority be guided and assisted in making maximum use of coordinated federal, state and local programs designed to stimulate the development of all water and land resources within the drainage area of the Wolf and Loosahatchie Rivers and Nonconnah and Horn Lake Creeks. It is the further intent of this part that in order to ensure the success of such regional planning and development the state may provide financial assistance to the authority for such purposes as are approved by the general assembly. The Chickasaw basin authority and the counties and municipalities within the designated area are authorized to request, develop, maintain and make available to the residents of such counties and municipalities the recreational and conservation areas adjacent to any approved project within the area of the Chickasaw basin authority. The authority shall have jurisdiction over such programs related to the rivers and streams and their respective drainage areas that flow within Shelby County. In addition, the authority shall have jurisdiction over such programs related to the Wolf River and its respective drainage area without regard to county or municipal boundaries.

       <p>
        The express purposes of the regional transportation authority are to improve mobility and expand multimodal transportation options for residents and visitors in Tennessee's large urban areas. The intent of the legislation is to respond to the growing need for regional approaches and solutions to managing traffic congestion and improving transportation options for residents, businesses and visitors in Tennessee's large urban areas. In an effort to ensure continued economic growth and prosperity and to encourage environmental sustainability, this part seeks to establish additional tools for local governments in those areas to work cooperatively to plan, finance, construct, operate, maintain and manage mass transit systems and related activities to include, but not be limited to, demand-response transit services, vanpool programs, rideshare programs, local bus services, regional bus services, bus rapid transit services, light rail transit services, commuter rail services, park-and-ride lots, transit oriented development nodes and all infrastructure that would be required to support or sustain these facilities or services and developments.

       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds may be repurchased by the authority out of any available funds at such price as the governing board shall determine, and all bonds so repurchased shall be cancelled or held as an investment of the authority as the governing board may determine;

       <p>
        Pending the preparation or execution of definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates or temporary bonds may be delivered to the purchasers of bonds;
       </p>
       <p>
        (i)  With respect to all or any portion of any issue of bonds issued under this subdivision (4), at any time during the term of the bonds, and upon receipt of a report of the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee finding that the contracts and agreements authorized in this subdivision (4) are in compliance with the guidelines, rules or regulations adopted or promulgated by the state funding board, as set forth in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.09.html#t09c21s9-21-130" target="_blank">9-21-130</a></cite>, the authority, by resolution of the governing board, may authorize and enter into interest rate swap or exchange agreements, agreements establishing interest rate floors or ceilings, or both, and other interest rate hedging agreements under such terms and conditions as the governing board may determine, including, without limitation, provisions permitting the authority to pay to, or receive from, any person or entity any loss of benefits under such agreement upon early termination of the agreement or default under the agreement;
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority may enter into an agreement to sell bonds, other than its refunding bonds, under this part providing for delivery of its bonds on a date greater than ninety (90) days and not greater than five (5) years or such greater period of time if approved by the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee, from the date of execution of the agreement or to sell its refunding bonds providing for delivery of the refunding bonds on a date greater than ninety (90) days from the date of execution of the agreement and not greater than the first optional redemption date on which the bonds being refunded can be optionally redeemed resulting in cost savings or at par, whichever is earlier, only upon receipt of a report of the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee finding that the agreement or contract of the authority to sell its bonds as authorized in this subdivision (4) is in compliance with the guidelines, rules or regulations adopted or promulgated by the state funding board in accordance with § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.09.html#t09c21s9-21-130" target="_blank">9-21-130</a></cite>. Agreements to sell bonds and refunding bonds for delivery ninety (90) days or less from the date of execution of the agreement do not require a report of the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee;
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the adoption by the governing board of a resolution authorizing a contract or agreement described in subdivision (4)(F)(i) or (4)(F)(ii), a request shall be submitted to the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee for a report finding that the contract or agreement is in compliance with the guidelines, rules or regulations of the state funding board. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request, the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee shall determine whether the contract or agreement substantially complies with the guidelines, rules or regulations and shall report on compliance to the authority. If the report of the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee finds that the contract or agreement complies with the guidelines, rules or regulations of the state funding board or the comptroller of the treasury shall fail to report within the fifteen-day period, then the authority may take such action with respect to the proposed contract or agreement as it deems advisable in accordance with this section and the guidelines, rules or regulations of the state funding board. If the report of the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee finds that the contract or agreement is not in compliance with the guidelines, rules or regulations, then the authority is not authorized to enter into the contract or agreement. The guidelines, rules or regulations shall provide for an appeal process upon a determination of noncompliance;
       </p>
       <p>
        When entering into any contracts or agreements facilitating the issuance and sale of bonds, including contracts or agreements providing for liquidity and credit enhancement and reimbursement agreements relating thereto, interest rate swap or exchange agreements, agreements establishing interest rate floors or ceilings, or both, other interest rate hedging agreements, and agreements with the purchaser of the bonds, evidencing a transaction bearing a reasonable relationship to this state and also to another state or nation, the authority may agree in the written contract or agreement that the rights and remedies of the parties to the contract or agreement shall be governed by the laws of this state or the laws of such other state or nation; provided, that jurisdiction over the authority shall lie solely in the courts of any participating metropolitan government, county, city or town;
       </p>
       <p>
        (i)  All bonds issued by the authority shall be payable out of the revenue and receipts derived from any projects, or of any portion of projects owned, operated or leased to or from the authority, as may be designated by the board of directors of the authority, or from any revenues to be derived directly or indirectly by the authority from such projects, or from any revenues derived directly or indirectly by the authority from the allocation, transfer, contribution or pledge of tax revenues or other moneys of any nature by the state or any county, municipality or other public instrumentality thereof;
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal of and interest on any bonds issued by the authority shall be secured, as may be designated by the governing board, by a pledge of revenues and receipts of the authority described in subdivision (4)(G)(i), by a pledge of the authority's rights under agreements, leases and other contracts, or by a mortgage or deed of trust covering all or any part of the projects from which the revenues or receipts so pledged may be derived. The proceedings under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any such pledge agreement or mortgage or deed of trust may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the projects covered by the bonds, the fixing and collection of rents for any portions of projects leased by the authority to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, all as the governing board deems advisable and not in conflict with this part. Each pledge, agreement, or mortgage or deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the pledge, agreement, or mortgage or deed of trust were made shall have been fully paid. In the event of default in the payment or in any agreement of the authority made as a part of the contract under which the bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the bonds or in any mortgage or deed of trust executed as security for the bonds, the payment or agreement may be enforced by suit, mandamus, the appointment of a receiver in equity or by foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust, or any one (1) or more of these remedies;
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority may issue interim certificates, bond anticipation notes or other temporary obligations pending the issuance of its revenue bonds, which temporary obligations shall be payable out of revenues and receipts of the authority in like manner as the revenue bonds and shall be retired from the proceeds of such bonds upon the issuance of the revenue bonds, and shall be in such form and contain such terms, conditions and provisions consistent with this part as the governing board may determine;
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds and notes of the authority shall be executed in the name of the authority by such officers of the authority and in such manner as the governing board may direct and shall be sealed with the corporate seal of the authority. If so provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds, the facsimile signature of any of the officers executing the bonds and a facsimile of the corporate seal of the authority may appear on the bonds in lieu of the manual signature of the officer and the manual impress of the seal;
       </p>
       <p>
        Any bonds and notes of the authority may be sold at public or private sale, for such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the governing board of directors of the authority to be most advantageous; and the authority may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions that its board of directors may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance of the bonds;
       </p>
       <p>
        Any participating metropolitan government, county, city or town is authorized to aid or otherwise provide assistance to an authority created pursuant to this part, including entering into leases of projects, or parts of projects with an authority, for such term or terms and upon such conditions as may be determined by resolution of the governing body of the metropolitan government, county, city or town, notwithstanding and without regard to the restrictions, prohibitions or requirements of any other law, whether public or private, or granting, contributing or pledging revenues of the metropolitan government, county, city or town to or for the benefit of the authority derived from any source;
       </p>
       <p>
        Any participating metropolitan government, county, city or town is authorized, upon recommendation of the governing board of the authority, to issue and sell its bonds to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement or expansion of the facilities authorized in this part, and to refund bonds previously issued by the metropolitan government, county, city or town or by the authority, or refinance indebtedness previously incurred for such purposes. The facilities authorized by this part shall be deemed to be public works projects for purposes of § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.09.html#t09c21s9-21-105" target="_blank">9-21-105</a></cite> of the Local Government Public Obligations Act of 1986 (LGPOA), compiled in title 9, chapter 21, and any such bonds issued by a participating metropolitan government, county, city or town under this part shall be issued, and the proceeds of the bonds applied, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the LGPOA. Notwithstanding this subdivision (4)(L), prior to the issuance of any general obligation bonds by a metropolitan government, county, city or town under the authority of this part, a referendum shall be held concurrently with a general election in the metropolitan government, county, city or town. The referendum shall in all other respects be conducted in compliance with the requirements of the LGPOA, specifically with those contained in §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.09.html#t09c21s9-21-205" target="_blank">9-21-205</a></cite> — <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.09.html#t09c21s9-21-209" target="_blank">9-21-209</a></cite>;
       </p>
       <p>
        Each participating metropolitan government, county, city or town, upon approval by resolution of its governing body, is authorized to enter into such agreements with the authority and the other participating metropolitan governments, counties, cities or towns as may be determined by the governing body of the metropolitan government, county, city or town to be convenient or necessary to accomplish the purposes set forth in subdivisions (4)(K) and (L);
       </p>
       <p>
        Except to the extent of any revenues that may be specifically allocated, transferred, contributed or pledged by a participating metropolitan government, county, city or town in accordance with this part and laws, rules and regulations applicable to this part, no metropolitan government, county, city or town shall in any event be liable for the payment of the principal of or interest on any bonds of the authority or for the performance of any pledge, mortgage, obligation or agreement of any kind whatsoever that may be undertaken by the authority, and none of the bonds of the authority or any of its agreements or obligations shall be construed to constitute an indebtedness of a participating metropolitan government, county, city or town within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision whatsoever;
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in this part shall be construed to allow the governing board of the authority to pledge unilaterally the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power of any metropolitan government, county, city or town as surety to the payment of the authority's bonds or to impose unilaterally an ad valorem tax in any metropolitan government, county, city or town;
       </p>
       <p>
        To delineate and create a special district in all or portions of the areas of the regional transportation authority for the purposes of facilitating the raising of revenues to be dedicated to the authority for the implementation of the authority's plan within the special district. A special district may be created only in those areas of the authority that have or are planned to have a benefit from services being provided by the authority and shall be permitted to include multiple metropolitan governments, counties, cities and towns. An authority may create more than one (1) special district and special districts may overlap. Local governments, by majority vote of their governing bodies, shall have the right to opt out of a special district created by the board of an authority prior to the levy of any tax or assessment within the special district;
       </p>
       <p>
        To accept funds from taxes or assessments levied by local governments served by the authority or act of the general assembly in order to provide funding for the plan adopted by the authority pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t64c08s64-8-206ol1a" target="_self">64-8-206(a)</a></cite>. The act of the general assembly may be initiated upon either:
       </p>
       <p>
        A formal request made by local governing bodies within the authority in the form of a local resolution; or
       </p>
       <p>
        The receipt of the certified results of a nonbinding advisory election. For such an election to be held, the governing body is authorized to direct the county election commission in the affected local governments to place the question on the ballot to be submitted to the voters in the affected local governments on the matter of general and vital concern of whether a particular tax or assessment with a certain rate should be levied within a special district of the authority by means of the general assembly in order to obtain the advice and direction of the voters as to such matters. The expense of any special election held within the territory of the special district of the authority shall be borne by the authority. The results of the election shall be advisory and nonbinding; and
       </p>
       <p>
        To petition its participating local governments to levy any tax or assessment authorized by law for state, county or municipal purposes and not prohibited by the Tennessee constitution and dedicate the proceeds of such tax or assessment to the authority. Any city or county government levying a tax pursuant to this subdivision (7) may limit the levy of the tax to the area included within the special district created by the regional transportation authority. Any local government levying a tax pursuant to this subdivision (7) may make the levy subject to approval by the qualified voters in the area subject to the tax in accordance with § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.02.html#t02c03s2-3-204" target="_blank">2-3-204</a></cite> in the following manner:
       </p>
       <p>
        (i)  Any ordinance or resolution of a participating local government levying the tax under authority of this part shall not become operative until approved in an election provided under this subdivision (7) in such local government;
       </p>
       <p>
        The county election commission shall hold an election on the question pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.02.html#t02c03s2-3-204" target="_blank">2-3-204</a></cite>, providing options to vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” the ordinance or resolution, after the receipt of a certified copy of such ordinance or resolution, and a majority vote of those voting in the election shall determine whether the ordinance or resolution is to be operative; and
       </p>
       <p>
        If the majority vote is for the ordinance or resolution, it shall be deemed to be operative on the date that the county election commission makes its official canvass of the election returns; provided, however, that no tax shall be collected under any such ordinance or resolution until the first day of a month occurring at least thirty (30) days after the operative date;
       </p>
       <p>
        (i)  If a county legislative body adopts a resolution to levy the tax at the same rate that is operative in a city or town in the county, the election under this section to determine whether the county tax is to be operative shall be open only to the voters residing outside of the city or town. If the county tax is at a higher rate than the rate of the city or town tax, the election shall also be open to the voters of the city or town; and
       </p>
       <p>
        Should any county or city or town hold an election under this subdivision (7), and the ordinance or resolution is rejected, no other election on the tax or assessment shall be held by the county, city or town for a period of six (6) months from the date of the holding of the prior election.

           The authority is authorized and empowered to issue its bonds, notes or other obligations from time to time for the purpose of paying in whole or in part the cost of acquiring necessary lands and interests therein, and of constructing and acquiring constructed facilities and improvements necessary to further the economy and growth of the agriculture industry of the region, and the expenses incidental thereto. Prior to the adoption of any resolution of the board authorizing the sale of bonds, notes or other obligations or entering into any contract or other arrangement in the planning or preparation for the sale of bonds, notes or other obligations, the authority shall review such plans with the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee. The state funding board established by § 9-9-101 is authorized to contract or to make other arrangements as it may deem necessary to provide for the issuance of such bonds, notes or other obligations of the authority or, in the state funding board's discretion, the authority may enter into such contracts or other arrangements. Any contract or arrangement entered into for the purpose of the issuance of any bonds, notes or other obligations shall be subject to the approval of the state funding board.

          <li id="t64c10s64-10-107ol1a2">
           Any resolution of the board authorizing the sale of bonds, notes or other obligations shall be submitted to the state funding board, and such resolution shall only become effective upon receiving the approval of the state funding board. The state funding board, upon rejecting any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of bonds, notes or other obligations, shall state in writing the reasons for this action.

           Except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection (b), all bonds, including notes or other obligations of the authority, issued by the authority, are payable solely out of the revenues and receipts derived from the authority's projects or of any revenues of the authority as may be designated in the proceedings of the board under which the bonds are authorized to be issued; provided, that notes issued in anticipation of the issuance of bonds may be retired out of the proceeds of such bonds. Such bonds may be executed and delivered by the authority at any time and from time to time, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places whether within or without Tennessee, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, may be executed by such officers of the authority and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the board whereunder the bonds shall be authorized to be issued.

           If deemed advisable by the board, there may be retained in the proceedings under which any bonds of the authority are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings and as may be briefly recited on the face of the bonds, but nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall be construed to confer on the authority any right or option to redeem any bonds except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued.

           Any bonds of the authority may be sold at public or private sale in such manner, at such price and from time to time as may be determined by the board to be most advantageous, and the authority may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions that its board may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof. Issuance by the board of one (1) or more series of bonds for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same project or any other project, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds.

          <li id="t64c10s64-10-107ol1b4">
           Proceeds of bonds issued by the authority may be used for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, reconstructing, improving, equipping, furnishing, bettering or extending any project or projects, including the payment of interest on the bonds during construction of any such project and for two (2) years after the estimated date of completion, and payment of engineering, fiscal, architectural and legal expenses incurred in connection with such project and the issuance of the bonds, and the establishment of a reasonable reserve fund for the payment of principal of and interest on such bonds in the event of a deficiency in the revenues and receipts available for such payment.

         Subject to the approvals required in subsection (a), any bonds or notes of the authority at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the authority by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the board may deem necessary, but not exceeding the sum of the following:

           Expenses, premiums and commissions of the authority, including bonds discount, deemed by the board to be necessary for the issuance of the refunding bonds. A determination by the board that any refinancing is advantageous or necessary to the authority, or that any of the amounts provided in this subdivision (c)(7) should be included in such refinancing or that any of the obligations to be refinanced should be called for redemption on the first or any subsequent available redemption date permitted to remain outstanding until their respective dates of maturity, shall be conclusive.

        </li>
        <li id="t64c10s64-10-107ol1d">
         Any such refunding may be effected whether the obligations to be refunded have then matured or thereafter mature, either by the exchange or the refunding bonds for the obligations to be refunded thereby with the consent of the holders of the obligations so to be refunded, or by sale of the refunding bonds, and the application of the proceeds thereof to the payment of the obligations to be refunded thereby, and regardless of whether or not the obligations proposed to be refunded are payable on the same date or different dates or are due serially or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li id="t64c10s64-10-107ol1e">
         Prior to the issuance of the refunding bonds, the board shall cause notice of its intention to issue the refunding bonds, identifying the obligations proposed to be refunded and setting forth the estimated date of delivery of the refunding bonds, to be given to the holders of the outstanding obligations by mail to each registered holder and, if the outstanding bonds or coupons are not registered securities, by publication of an appropriate notice one (1) time each in a newspaper having general circulation in the area of the project and in a financial newspaper published in New York, New York, having national circulation. As soon as practicable after the delivery of the refunding bonds, and whether or not any of the obligations to be refunded are to be called for redemption, the board shall cause notice of the issuance of the refunding bonds to be given in the manner provided in this subsection (e).
        </li>
        <li id="t64c10s64-10-107ol1f">
         If any of the obligations to be refunded are to be called for redemption, the board shall cause notice of redemption to be given in the manner required by the proceedings authorizing such outstanding obligations.

           To the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded; or

           To the extent not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded, then such proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded; but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any surplus, including, without limitation, provision for the pledging of any such surplus to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series of refunding bonds. Money in any such trust fund may be invested in direct obligations of the United States government, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government, or obligations of any authority or instrumentality of the United States government or in certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in this state, if such certificates are secured by a pledge of any of such obligations having any aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing in this subsection (g) shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded but that have not matured and that are not presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable, have not been called for redemption.

        <li id="t64c10s64-10-107ol1i">
         The principal of and interest on any bonds issued by the authority may be secured by a pledge of the revenues and receipts out of which the same shall be made payable and may be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust covering all or any part of the projects from which the revenues or receipts so pledged may be derived, including any enlargements of and additions to any such projects thereafter made, and/or by an assignment and pledge of all or any part of the authority's interest in and rights under the leases, sale contracts or loan agreements relating to such projects, or any part thereof. The resolution under which the bonds are authorized to be issued and any such mortgage or deed of trust may contain any agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the projects covered thereby, the fixing and collection of rents or payments with respect to any projects or portions thereof covered by such resolution, mortgage or deed of trust, the creation and maintenance of special funds from such revenues and from the proceeds of such bonds and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, all as the board deems advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge, agreement, mortgage and deed of trust made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds of the authority shall continue effective until the principal of and interest on the bonds for the benefit of which the same were made have been fully paid. In the event of default in such payment or in any agreements of the authority made as a part of the contract under which the bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the bonds or in any mortgage and deed of trust executed as security for the bonds, such payment or agreement may be enforced by suit, mandamus, the appointment of a receiver in equity or by foreclosure of any such mortgage and deed of trust, or any one (1) or more of the above remedies.
