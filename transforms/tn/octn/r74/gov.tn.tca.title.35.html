       After finding that Tennessee's Uniform Fiduciaries Act (UFA) displaced plaintiffs'  negligence claims and shielded the bank from liability arising from the actions of a fiduciary depositor, only plaintiffs'  allegations of “knowing” or “bad faith” conduct survived and those claims were preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as the bank merely held the funds on deposit and custody of plan assets alone could not establish control sufficient to confer fiduciary status; thus the bank was not subject to liability as an ERISA fiduciary.

      When a deposit is made in a bank or savings institution in the name of two (2) or more persons as fiduciaries and a check is drawn upon the fiduciary account by any fiduciary or fiduciaries authorized by the other fiduciary or fiduciaries to draw checks upon the fiduciary account, neither the payee nor other holder nor the bank or savings institution is bound to inquire whether it is a breach of trust to authorize such fiduciary or fiduciaries to draw checks upon the fiduciary account, and is not liable unless the circumstances be such that the action of the payee or other holder or the bank or savings institution amounts to bad faith.

       If it could be conceded that this chapter may be given a curative effect, insofar as the illegality grounded on the investment of the ward's funds in an existing and outstanding mortgage loan is concerned, it can hardly be reasonably contended that anything in the chapter covers or cures the fundamental illegality of an investment of a ward's funds in a loan owned by the guardian — a purchase from itself.

       Notwithstanding any other law, a bank or trust company, to the extent it acts at the direction of another person authorized to direct investment of funds held by the bank or trust company, or to the extent that it exercises investment discretion as a fiduciary, custodian, managing agent, or otherwise with respect to the investment and reinvestment of assets that it maintains in its trust department, may invest and reinvest the assets, subject to the standard contained in this section, in the securities of any open-end or closed-end management investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. §§ 80a-1 — 80a-64). The fact that the bank or trust company, or any affiliate of the bank or trust company, is providing services to the investment company or trust as investment advisor, sponsor, distributor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar or otherwise, and receiving reasonable remuneration for the services, does not preclude the bank or trust company from investing in the securities of the investment company or trust.

       In the absence of express provisions to the contrary in the governing instrument, a fiduciary will not be liable to the beneficiaries or to the trust with respect to a decision regarding the allocation and nature of investments of trust assets unless the court determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.

         To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or a distribution that is too small, the court shall require a distribution from the trust to the beneficiary in an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position, taking into account all prior distributions to the beneficiary.

         To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary that is too large, the court shall restore the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, to their appropriate positions, taking into account all prior distributions, by requiring the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one (1) or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or requiring that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust.

If the position describes the proposed plan of investment and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed plan of investment, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed plan of investment has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.

       Nominee failed to state a claim for setting aside the foreclosure sale because the mere failure of the trustee to give notice of the foreclosure sale in accordance with applicable law was not sufficient to set aside the sale.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in summarily dismissing a nominee's claims against a trustee because the nominee qualified as an interested party since it had a recorded interest in a lien that would be extinguished or adversely affected by the sale; the nominee held legal title to the secured interest and was the beneficiary of record, and the trustee failed to comply with the notice requirements and was liable to the party injured by the noncompliance for all damages resulting from the failure.

       Standing was not a ground upon which to dismiss any of a nominee's claims against a trustee because the nominee was a “party interested” pursuant to the statute; the nominee was the record holder of a lien that would be extinguished or adversely affected by the foreclosure sale, and for that reason the nominee had standing to pursue the claims asserted in the action.

       Trial court erred in granting a lender's motion for summary judgment because, while the deed of trust did not provide a specific time requirement on the issue of the foreclosure sale other than to reference the foreclosure statutes and the notice of sale, questions remained as to whether the postponed foreclosure sale was held at the time and under the terms designated in the notice, and the sale could not be deemed void or voidable even when it did not comply with the foreclosure statutes.

       Chancery court does not have jurisdiction to set aside sale by trustee under trust deed where trustee fails to sell pursuant to defendant's plan, since sale is neither void nor voidable, and defendant's only remedy is to sue trustee for damages. Doty v. Federal Land Bank, 169 Tenn. 496, 89 S.W.2d 337, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1936), rehearing denied, 169 Tenn. 496, 90 S.W.2d 527 (1936).

       Trial court erred in summarily dismissing a nominee's claims against a trustee because the nominee qualified as an interested party since it had a recorded interest in a lien that would be extinguished or adversely affected by the sale; the nominee held legal title to the secured interest and was the beneficiary of record, and the trustee failed to comply with the notice requirements and was liable to the party injured by the noncompliance for all damages resulting from the failure.

       Trial court properly dismissed a nominee's claim against a trustee because the nominee failed to state a claim for setting aside the foreclosure sale; the mere fact that the sale was for a price that was grossly inadequate or unfair failed to state a claim to set aside the foreclosure sale, and there were no allegations of irregularity, misconduct, fraud, or unfairness on the part of the trustee.

      At any time before ten o'clock a.m. (10:00 a.m.) on the day of sale, the defendant or other person whose property is to be sold may deliver to the officer or person making the sale, a plan of division of the lands to be sold, subscribed by the defendant or other person, bearing a date subsequent to the date of advertisement, in which case so much of the land as may be necessary to satisfy the debt and costs, and no more, shall be sold according to the plan furnished.

       In a sale of land under execution, where it is levied on as one entire tract, it is not the duty of the sheriff, nor has he the right himself, to divide the land and sell it in parcels, though it be susceptible of division by well defined natural and artificial boundaries. This rule is not affected by the smallness of the debt as compared to the value of the land levied upon. Jones v. Townsend, 2 Shan. 167 (1876); Lucas v. Moore, 70 Tenn. 1, 1878 Tenn.

       In an action brought by a creditor to recover a balance still owing on an indebtedness after a trustee's or foreclosure sale of real property secured by a deed of trust or mortgage, the creditor shall be entitled to a deficiency judgment in an amount sufficient to satisfy fully the indebtedness.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c05s35-5-118ol1b">
       In all such actions, absent a showing of fraud, collusion, misconduct, or irregularity in the sale process, the deficiency judgment shall be for the total amount of indebtedness prior to the sale plus the costs of the foreclosure and sale, less the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale. The creditor shall be entitled to a rebuttable prima facie presumption that the sale price of the property is equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c05s35-5-118ol1c">
       To overcome the presumption set forth in subsection (b), the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property sold for an amount materially less than the fair market value of property at the time of the foreclosure sale. If the debtor overcomes the presumption, the deficiency shall be the total amount of the indebtedness prior to the sale plus the costs of the foreclosure and sale, less the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale as determined by the court.

       Mortgagee's summary judgment for a deficiency judgment after a foreclosure sale was proper as the mortgagor did not rebut the presumption that the price attained at the foreclosure sale was the fair market value of the property under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c05s35-5-118ol1b" target="_self">35-5-118(b)</a></cite> where the mortgagor's attorney waived the issue; the claims raised in the mortgagor's affidavit and response to the summary judgment motion were immaterial as the mortgagor failed to pay the promissory notes, and there was no dispute as to the sale price attained at the foreclosure sale. Commercial Bank, Inc. v. Lacy, 371 S.W.3d 121, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 165 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2012), appeal denied, Commercial Bank v. Lacy, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 457 (Tenn. June 20, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly held that a bank was entitled to summary judgment on its deficiency claim because debtors were unable to overcome the statutory presumption that the foreclosure price represented the property's fair market value at the time of the sale; the 15.8 percent difference between the appraised price and the foreclosure sale price, with nothing more, was insufficient to establish that the property was sold for an amount materially less than its fair market value. Capital Bank v. Brock, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 382 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 30, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of borrowers'  claims against a bank which sought a deficiency judgment was appropriate because the borrowers failed to rebut the presumption that the foreclosure price was equal to the fair market value of the foreclosed properties at the time of each foreclosure sale. Furthermore, the bank was neither unjustly enriched, nor did it receive a windfall because the foreclosure sale prices were not materially less than fair market value at the time of foreclosure.

       Lender was properly granted summary judgment on its claim for a deficiency judgment against the note guarantors where a lease purchase agreement between the guarantors and a lessee was inapplicable, and the guarantors' assertion that the property was complete and habitable was insufficient to show that the appraisal price, which was 20 percent higher than the foreclosure price, was equal to the fair market value.

      <p>
       Bank that purchased real property that was owned by Chapter 13 debtors at a foreclosure sale was entitled to summary judgment on its claim that it had a claim in the amount of $47,081 against the debtors'  bankruptcy estate because the amount it paid for the property was less than the debtors owed on a note they signed; the debtors did not rebut the presumption established by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c05s35-5-118" target="_self">35-5-118</a></cite> that the sale price of the property was equal to the fair market value of the property by introducing a tax appraisal that valued the property at $502,900, and the bank's bid of $387,000 was not materially less than the fair market value of $425,000 established by an appraisal, given anticipated expenses of preparing the property for resale. In re Radewald, — B.R. —, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 984 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. Mar. 30, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred as to the fair market value of a commercial property at the time of a foreclosure sale because the sellers, who bought the property at the sale, sold the property for a lesser value several weeks after the sale. The buyers, who defaulted upon a promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the property, thus proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the property sold for an amount materially less than the fair market value of the property at the time of the foreclosure sale. Cutshaw v. Hensley, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 609 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 29, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor successfully rebutted the statutory presumption that the sale price of a foreclosed property was equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of the foreclosure sale, as the foreclosure sale price was materially less than fair market value; a company's offer, purportedly made two months prior to the foreclosure sale, most closely represented fair market value, and 2007 and 2009 appraisals were too far removed in time to be probative of fair market value. Eastman Credit Union v. Bennett, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 229 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Borrowers claimed the trial court erred by considering the listed sale price two years after foreclosure as evidence of fair market value, but there was no merit to this contention because the only value evidence the trial court relied upon was the value opinions of two experts; consideration of the listed sale price aided the trial court in its assessment of the experts'  appraisals and the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that one expert's valuation of the property was credible. Commerce Union Bank v. Bush, 512 S.W.3d 217, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 29, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 881 (Tenn. Nov. 16, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court correctly determined that the foreclosure sale price was not materially less than the fair market value; the presumptive fair market value of the property was $ 1,050,000, and this value was corroborated by one expert's two appraisals of the same value, and what the borrowers probably could have gotten eventually was inconsequential, as the issue was the fair market value at the time of the foreclosure sale. Commerce Union Bank v. Bush, 512 S.W.3d 217, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 29, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 881 (Tenn. Nov. 16, 2016).

       Bank followed proper procedures in selecting an appraiser and did not influence the value of the appraisal for which it relied upon in placing its bid at the foreclosure sale; the bank was not afforded an opportunity to evaluate one certain appraisal prior to the foreclosure sale because it never received a copy of the appraisal and thus the bank was justified in relying on the appraisal in its possession, and there was no fraud, collusion, misconduct, or irregularity in connection with the foreclosure process.

        Trial court correctly ordered a trust res to be distributed in accordance with the original unannotated document because the settlor's holographic notations were not sufficient to manifest a clear intent to modify her trust; the settlor did not make her changes in a separate instrument, she did not sign or initial her handwritten changes, and she did not communicate her changes to anyone or deliver a copy of the annotated trust document to another person.

       <p>
        Because the trust did not specify that the method for modification provided in the trust was exclusive, the trial court was correct to consider whether the settlor's handwritten notations manifested clear and convincing evidence of the settlor's intent to modify the trust.

        “Income beneficiary.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The definitions of income beneficiary (Section 102(5)) and income interest (Section 102(6)[§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-102ol15" target="_self">35-6-102(5)</a></cite>]) cover both mandatory and discretionary beneficiaries and interests. There are no definitions for “discretionary income beneficiary” or “discretionary income interest” because those terms are not used in the Act.

       <p>
        Inventory value.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no definition for inventory value in this Act because the provisions in which that term was used in the 1962 Act have either been eliminated (in the case of the underproductive property provision) or changed in a way that eliminates the need for the term (in the case of bonds and other money obligations, property subject to depletion, and the method for determining entitlement to income distributed from a probate estate).

        “Net income.”

        The reference to “transfers under this Act to or from income” means transfers made under Sections 104(a), 412(b), 502(b), 503(b), 504(a), and 506 [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c05s36-5-104ol1a" target="_blank">36-5-104(a)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-412ol1b" target="_self">35-6-412(b)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-502ol1b" target="_self">35-6-502(b)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-503ol1b" target="_self">35-6-503(b)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-504ol1a" target="_self">35-6-504(a)</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-506" target="_self">35-6-506</a></cite>].

        “Terms of a trust.”
       </p>
       <p>
        This term was chosen in preference to “terms of the trust instrument” (the phrase used in the 1962 Act) to make it clear that the Act applies to oral trusts as well as those whose terms are expressed in written documents. The definition is based on the Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 4 (1959) and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 4 (Tent. Draft No. 1, 1996). Constructional preferences or rules would also apply, if necessary, to determine the terms of the trust.

       <p>
        Prior Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule in Section 2(a) of the 1962 Act is restated in Section 103(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a" target="_self">35-6-103(a)</a></cite>], without changing its substance, to emphasize that the Act contains only default rules and that provisions in the terms of the trust are paramount. However, Section 2(a) of the 1962 Act applies only to the allocation of receipts and disbursements to or between principal and income. In this Act, the first sentence of Section 103(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a" target="_self">35-6-103(a)</a></cite>] states that it also applies to matters within the scope of Articles 2 and 3. Section 103(a)(2) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a2" target="_self">35-6-103(a)(2)</a></cite>] incorporates the rule in Section 2(b) of the 1962 Act that a discretionary allocation made by the trustee that is contrary to a rule in the Act should not give rise to an inference of imprudence or partiality by the trustee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Act deletes the language that appears at the end of 1962 Act Section 2(a)(3) — “and in view of the manner in which men of ordinary prudence, discretion and judgment would act in the management of their affairs” — because persons of ordinary prudence, discretion and judgment, acting in the management of their own affairs do not normally think in terms of the interests of successive beneficiaries. If there is an analogy to an individual's decision-making process, it is probably the individual's decision to spend or to save, but this is not a useful guideline for trust administration. No case has been found in which a court has relied on the “prudent man” rule of the 1962 Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fiduciary discretion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that if a discretionary power is conferred upon a trustee, the exercise of that power is not subject to control by a court except to prevent an abuse of discretion. Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 187. The situations in which a court will control the exercise of a trustee's discretion are discussed in the comments to § 187. See also id. § 233 Comment p.
       </p>
       <p>
        Questions for which there is no provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 103(a)(4) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a4" target="_self">35-6-103(a)(4)</a></cite>] allocates receipts and disbursements to principal when there is no provision for a different allocation in the terms of the trust, the will, or the Act. This may occur because money is received from a financial instrument not available at the present time (inflation-indexed bonds might have fallen into this category had they been announced after this Act was approved by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws) or because a transaction is of a type or occurs in a manner not anticipated by the Drafting Committee for this Act or the drafter of the trust instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        Allocating to principal a disbursement for which there is no provision in the Act or the terms of the trust preserves the income beneficiary's level of income in the year it is allocated to principal, but thereafter will reduce the amount of income produced by the principal. Allocating to principal a receipt for which there is no provision will increase the income received by the income beneficiary in subsequent years, and will eventually, upon termination of the trust, also favor the remainder beneficiary. Allocating these items to principal implements the rule that requires a trustee to administer the trust impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to both income and remainder beneficiaries. However, if the trustee decides that an adjustment between principal and income is needed to enable the trustee to comply with Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>], after considering the return from the portfolio as a whole, the trustee may make an appropriate adjustment under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>].
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of impartiality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever there are two or more beneficiaries, a trustee is under a duty to deal impartially with them. Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 183 (1992). This rule applies whether the beneficiaries' interests in the trust are concurrent or successive. If the terms of the trust give the trustee discretion to favor one beneficiary over another, a court will not control the exercise of such discretion except to prevent the trustee from abusing it. Id. § 183, Comment a. “The precise meaning of the trustee's duty of impartiality and the balancing of competing interests and objectives inevitably are matters of judgment and interpretation. Thus, the duty and balancing are affected by the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust, not only at the outset but as they may change from time to time.” Id. § 232, Comment c.
       </p>
       <p>
        The terms of a trust may provide that the trustee, or an accountant engaged by the trustee, or a committee of persons who may be family members or business associates, shall have the power to determine what is income and what is principal. If the terms of a trust provide that this Act specifically or principal and income legislation in general does not apply to the trust but fail to provide a rule to deal with a matter provided for in this Act, the trustee has an implied grant of discretion to decide the question. Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>] provides that the rule of impartiality applies in the exercise of such a discretionary power to the extent that the terms of the trust do not provide that one or more of the beneficiaries are to be favored. The fact that a person is named an income beneficiary or a remainder beneficiary is not by itself an indication of partiality for that beneficiary.

        Purpose and Scope of Provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] is to enable a trustee to select investments using the standards of a prudent investor without having to realize a particular portion of the portfolio's total return in the form of traditional trust accounting income such as interest, dividends, and rents. Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>(a)] authorizes a trustee to make adjustments between principal and income if three conditions are met: (1) the trustee must be managing the trust assets under the prudent investor rule; (2) the terms of the trust must express the income beneficiary's distribution rights in terms of the right to receive “income” in the sense of traditional trust accounting income; and (3) the trustee must determine, after applying the rules in Section 103(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a" target="_self">35-6-103(a)</a></cite>], that he is unable to comply with Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>]. In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust, the trustee is required to consider the factors described in Section 104(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1b" target="_self">35-6-104(b)</a></cite>], but the trustee may not make an adjustment in circumstances described in Section 104(c) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1c" target="_self">35-6-104(c)</a></cite>].
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] does not empower a trustee to increase or decrease the degree of beneficial enjoyment to which a beneficiary is entitled under the terms of the trust; rather, it authorizes the trustee to make adjustments between principal and income that may be necessary if the income component of a portfolio's total return is too small or too large because of investment decisions made by the trustee under the prudent investor rule. The paramount consideration in applying Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>(a)] is the requirement in Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>] that “a fiduciary must administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries.” The power to adjust is subject to control by the court to prevent an abuse of discretion. Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 187 (1959). See also id. §§ 183, 232, 233, Comment p (1959).

        Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] will be important for trusts that are irrevocable when a State adopts the prudent investor rule by statute or judicial approval of the rule in Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule. Wills and trust instruments executed after the rule is adopted can be drafted to describe a beneficiary's distribution rights in terms that do not depend upon the amount of trust accounting income, but to the extent that drafters of trust documents continue to describe an income beneficiary's distribution rights by referring to trust accounting income, Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] will be an important tool in trust administration.

        Power to Adjust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The exercise of the power to adjust is governed by a trustee's duty of impartiality, which requires the trustee to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of the income and remainder beneficiaries. Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>] expresses this duty by requiring the trustee to “administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries.” Because this involves the exercise of judgment in circumstances rarely capable of perfect resolution, trustees are not expected to achieve perfection; they are, however, required to make conscious decisions in good faith and with proper motives.
       </p>
       <p>
        In seeking the proper balance between the interests of the beneficiaries in matters involving principal and income, a trustee's traditional approach has been to determine the settlor's objectives from the terms of the trust, gather the information needed to ascertain the financial circumstances of the beneficiaries, determine the extent to which the settlor's objectives can be achieved with the resources available in the trust, and then allocate the trust's assets between stocks and fixed-income securities in a way that will produce a particular level or range of income for the income beneficiary. The key element in this process has been to determine the appropriate level or range of income for the income beneficiary, and that will continue to be the key element in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the discretionary power conferred by Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>]. If it becomes necessary for a court to determine whether an abuse of the discretionary power to adjust between principal and income has occurred, the criteria should be the same as those that courts have used in the past to determine whether a trustee has abused its discretion in allocating the trust's assets between stocks and fixed-income securities.
       </p>
       <p>
        A fiduciary has broad latitude in choosing the methods and criteria to use in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust in order to achieve impartiality between income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries or the degree of partiality for one or the other that is provided for by the terms of the trust or the will. For example, in deciding what the appropriate level or range of income should be for the income beneficiary and whether to exercise the power, a trustee may use the methods employed prior to the adoption of the 1997 Act in deciding how to allocate trust assets between stocks and fixed-income securities; or may consider the amount that would be distributed each year based on a percentage of the portfolio's value at the beginning or end of an accounting period, portfolio orthe average portfolio value for several accounting periods, in a manner similar to a unitrust, and may select a percentage that the trustee believes is appropriate for this purpose and use the same percentage or different percentages in subsequent years. The trustee may also use hypothetical portfolios of marketable securities to determine an appropriate level or range of income within which a distribution might fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        An adjustment may be made prospectively at the beginning of an accounting period, based on a projected return or range of returns for a trust's portfolio, or retrospectively after the fiduciary knows the total realized or unrealized return for the period; and instead of an annual adjustment, the trustee may distribute a fixed dollar amount for several years, in a manner similar to an annuity, and may change the fixed dollar amount periodically. No inference of abuse is to be drawn if a fiduciary uses different methods or criteria for the same trust from time to time, or uses different methods or criteria for different trusts for the same accounting period.
       </p>
       <p>
        While a trustee must consider the portfolio as a whole in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust, a trustee may apply different criteria in considering the portion of the portfolio that is composed of marketable securities and the portion whose market value cannot be determined readily, and may take into account a beneficiary's use or possession of a trust asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the prudent investor rule, a trustee is to incur costs that are appropriate and reasonable in relation to the assets and the purposes of the trust, and the same consideration applies in determining whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust. In making investment decisions under the prudent investor rule, the trustee will have considered the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust for the purpose of adopting an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust. A trustee is not required to duplicate that work for principal and income purposes, and in many cases the decision about whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust may be made at the same time as the investment decisions. To help achieve the objective of reasonable investment costs, a trustee may also adopt policies that apply to all trusts or to individual trusts or classes of trusts, based on their size or other criteria, stating whether and under what circumstances the power to adjust will be exercised and the method of making adjustments; no inference of abuse is to be drawn if a trustee adopts such policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three conditions to the exercise of the power to adjust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first of the three conditions that must be met before a trustee can exercise the power to adjust — that the trustee invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor — is expressed in this Act by language derived from the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, but the condition will be met whether the prudent investor rule applies because the Uniform Act or other prudent investor legislation has been enacted, the prudent investor rule has been approved by the courts, or the terms of the trust require it. Even if a State's legislature or courts have not formally adopted the rule, the Restatement establishes the prudent investor rule as an authoritative interpretation of the common law prudent man rule, referring to the prudent investor rule as a “modest reformulation of the Harvard College dictum and the basic rule of prior Restatements.” Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule, Introduction, at 5. As a result, there is a basis for concluding that the first condition is satisfied in virtually all States except those in which a trustee is permitted to invest only in assets set forth in a statutory “legal list.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The second condition will be met when the terms of the trust require all of the “income” to be distributed at regular intervals; or when the terms of the trust require a trustee to distribute all of the income, but permit the trustee to decide how much to distribute to each member of a class of beneficiaries; or when the terms of a trust provide that the beneficiary shall receive the greater of the trust accounting income and a fixed dollar amount (an annuity), or of trust accounting income and a fractional share of the value of the trust assets (a unitrust amount). If the trust authorizes the trustee in its discretion to distribute the trust's income to the beneficiary or to accumulate some or all of the income, the condition will be met because the terms of the trust do not permit the trustee to distribute more than the trust accounting income.
       </p>
       <p>
        To meet the third condition, the trustee must first meet the requirements of Section 103(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a" target="_self">35-6-103(a)</a></cite>], i.e., she must apply the terms of the trust, decide whether to exercise the discretionary powers given to the trustee under the terms of the trust, and must apply the provisions of the Act if the terms of the trust do not contain a different provision or give the trustee discretion. Second, the trustee must determine the extent to which the terms of the trust clearly manifest an intention by the settlor that the trustee may or must favor one or more of the beneficiaries. To the extent that the terms of the trust do not require partiality, the trustee must conclude that she is unable to comply with the duty to administer the trust impartially. To the extent that the terms of the trust do require or permit the trustee to favor the income beneficiary or the remainder beneficiary, the trustee must conclude that she is unable to achieve the degree of partiality required or permitted. If the trustee comes to either conclusion — that she is unable to administer the trust impartially or that she is unable to achieve the degree of partiality required or permitted — she may exercise the power to adjust under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>].
       </p>
       <p>
        Impartiality and productivity of income.
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty of impartiality between income and remainder beneficiaries is linked to the trustee's duty to make the portfolio productive of trust accounting income whenever the distribution requirements are expressed in terms of distributing the trust's “income.” The 1962 Act implies that the duty to produce income applies on an asset by asset basis because the right of an income beneficiary to receive “delayed income” from the sale proceeds of underproductive property under Section 12 of that Act arises if “any part of principal … has not produced an average net income of a least 1% per year of its inventory value for more than a year ….” Under the prudent investor rule, “[t]o whatever extent a requirement of income productivity exists,… the requirement applies not investment by investment but to the portfolio as a whole.” Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, Comment i, at 34. The power to adjust under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] is also to be exercised by considering net income from the portfolio as a whole and not investment by investment. Section 413(b) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-413ol1b" target="_self">35-6-413(b)</a></cite>] eliminates the underproductive property rule in all cases other than trusts for which a marital deduction is allowed, and it applies to a marital deduction trust if the trust's assets “consist substantially of property that does not provide the surviving spouse with sufficient income from or use of the trust assets …” — in other words, the section applies by reference to the portfolio as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the purpose of the power to adjust in Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] is to eliminate the need for a trustee who operates under the prudent investor rule to be concerned about the income component of the portfolio's total return, the trustee must still determine the extent to which a distribution must be made to an income beneficiary and the adequacy of the portfolio's liquidity as a whole to make that distribution.

       <p>
        Factors to consider in exercising the power to adjust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 104(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>(b)] requires a trustee to consider factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries in deciding whether and to what extent the power to adjust should be exercised. Section 2(c) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act sets forth circumstances that a trustee is to consider in investing and managing trust assets. The circumstances in Section 2(c) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act are the source of the factors in paragraphs (3) through (6) and (8) of Section 104(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>(b)(3)-(6), (8)] (modified where necessary to adapt them to the purposes of this Act) so that, to the extent possible, comparable factors will apply to investment decisions and decisions involving the power to adjust. If a trustee who is operating under the prudent investor rule decides that the portfolio should be composed of financial assets whose total return will result primarily from capital appreciation rather than dividends, interest, and rents, the trustee can decide at the same time the extent to which an adjustment from principal to income may be necessary under Section 104 [§ 35-6-104]. On the other hand, if a trustee decides that the risk and return objectives for the trust are best achieved by a portfolio whose total return includes interest and dividend income that is sufficient to provide the income beneficiary with the beneficial interest to which the beneficiary is entitled under the terms of the trust, the trustee can decide that it is unnecessary to exercise the power to adjust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Assets received from the settlor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 3 of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act provides that “[a] trustee shall diversify the investments of the trust unless the trustee reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, the purposes of the trust are better served without diversifying.” The special circumstances may include the wish to retain a family business, the benefit derived from deferring liquidation of the asset in order to defer payment of income taxes, or the anticipated capital appreciation from retaining an asset such as undeveloped real estate for a long period. To the extent the trustee retains assets received from the settlor because of special circumstances that overcome the duty to diversify, the trustee may take these circumstances into account in determining whether and to what extent the power to adjust should be exercised to change the results produced by other provisions of this Act that apply to the retained assets. See Section 104(b)(5) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1b5" target="_self">35-6-104(b)(5)</a></cite>]; Uniform Prudent Investor Act § 3, Comment, 7B U.L.A. 18, at 25-26 (Supp. 1997); Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 229 and Comments a-e.
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitations on the power to adjust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of subsections (c)(1) through (4) is to preserve tax benefits that may have been an important purpose for creating the trust. Subsections (c)(5), (6), and (8) deny the power to adjust in the circumstances described in those subsections in order to prevent adverse tax consequences, and subsection (c)(7) denies the power to adjust to any beneficiary, whether or not possession of the power may have adverse tax consequences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (c)(1), a trustee cannot make an adjustment that diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a surviving spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction is allowed; but this subsection does not prevent the trustee from making an adjustment that increases the amount of income paid from a marital deduction trust to the surviving spouse. Subsection (c)(1) applies to a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction because the surviving spouse has a general power of appointment over the trust, but it applies to a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust only if and to the extent that the fiduciary makes the election required to obtain the tax deduction. Subsection (c)(1) does not apply to a so-called “estate” trust. This type of trust qualifies for the marital deduction because the terms of the trust require the principal and undistributed income to be paid to the surviving spouse's estate when the spouse dies; it is not necessary for the terms of an estate trust to require the income to be distributed annually. Reg. § 20.2056(c)-2(b)(1)(iii).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c)(3) applies to annuity trusts and unitrusts with no charitable beneficiaries as well as to trusts with charitable income or remainder beneficiaries; its purpose is to make it clear that a beneficiary's right to receive a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of a trust's assets is not subject to adjustment under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>]. Subsection (c)(3) does not apply to any additional amount to which the beneficiary may be entitled that is expressed in terms of a right to receive income from the trust. For example, if a beneficiary is to receive a fixed annuity or the trust's income, whichever is greater, subsection (c)(3) does not prevent a trustee from making an adjustment under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] in determining the amount of the trust's income.
       </p>
       <p>
        If subsection (c)(5), (6), (7), or (8), prevents a trustee from exercising the power to adjust, subsection (d) permits a cotrustee who is not subject to the provision to exercise the power unless the terms of the trust do not permit the cotrustee to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Release of the power to adjust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 104(e) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1e" target="_self">35-6-104(e)</a></cite>] permits a trustee to release all or part of the power to adjust in circumstances in which the possession or exercise of the power might deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden. For example, if possessing the power would diminish the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust for which the income beneficiary's estate may be eligible to claim a credit for property previously taxed if the beneficiary dies within ten years after the death of the person creating the trust, the trustee is permitted under subsection (e) to release just the power to adjust from income to principal.

        Trust terms that limit a power to adjust.
       </p>

        Section 104(f) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1f" target="_self">35-6-104(f)</a></cite>] applies to trust provisions that limit a trustee's power to adjust. Since the power is intended to enable trustees to employ the prudent investor rule without being constrained by traditional principal and income rules, an instrument executed before the adoption of this Act whose terms describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income or that prohibit the invasion of principal or that prohibit equitable adjustments in general should not be construed as forbidding the use of the power to adjust under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] if the need for adjustment arises because the trustee is operating under the prudent investor rule. Instruments containing such provisions that are executed after the adoption of this Act should specifically refer to the power to adjust if the settlor intends to forbid its use. See generally, Joel C. Dobris, Limits on the Doctrine of Equitable Adjustment in Sophisticated Postmortem Tax Planning, 66 Iowa L. Rev. 273 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Examples.
       </p>
       <p>
        The following examples illustrate the application of Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>]:
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (1) — T is the successor trustee of a trust that provides income to A for life, remainder to B. T has received from the prior trustee a portfolio of financial assets invested 20% in stocks and 80% in bonds. Following the prudent investor rule, T determines that a strategy of investing the portfolio 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds has risk and return objectives that are reasonably suited to the trust, but T also determines that adopting this approach will cause the trust to receive a smaller amount of dividend and interest income. After considering the factors in Section 104(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1b" target="_self">35-6-104(b)</a></cite>], T may transfer cash from principal to income to the extent T considers it necessary to increase the amount distributed to the income beneficiary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (2) — T is the trustee of a trust that requires the income to be paid to the settlor's son C for life, remainder to C's daughter D. In a period of very high inflation, T purchases bonds that pay double-digit interest and determines that a portion of the interest, which is allocated to income under Section 406 of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-406" target="_self">35-6-406</a></cite>], is a return of capital. In consideration of the loss of value of principal due to inflation and other factors that T considers relevant, T may transfer part of the interest to principal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (3) — T is the trustee of a trust that requires the income to be paid to the settlor's sister E for life, remainder to charity F. E is a retired schoolteacher who is single and has no children. E's income from her social security, pension, and savings exceeds the amount required to provide for her accustomed standard of living. The terms of the trust permit T to invade principal to provide for E's health and to support her in her accustomed manner of living, but do not otherwise indicate that T should favor E or F. Applying the prudent investor rule, T determines that the trust assets should be invested entirely in growth stocks that produce very little dividend income. Even though it is not necessary to invade principal to maintain E's accustomed standard of living, she is entitled to receive from the trust the degree of beneficial enjoyment normally accorded a person who is the sole income beneficiary of a trust, and T may transfer cash from principal to income to provide her with that degree of enjoyment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (4) — T is the trustee of a trust that is governed by the law of State X. The trust became irrevocable before State X adopted the prudent investor rule. The terms of the trust require all of the income to be paid to G for life, remainder to H, and also give T the power to invade principal for the benefit of G for “dire emergencies only.” The terms of the trust limit the aggregate amount that T can distribute to G from principal during G's life to 6% of the trust's value at its inception. The trust's portfolio is invested initially 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds, but after State X adopts the prudent investor rule T determines that, to achieve suitable risk and return objectives for the trust, the assets should be invested 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds. This change increases the total return from the portfolio and decreases the dividend and interest income. Thereafter, even though G does not experience a dire emergency, T may exercise the power to adjust under Section 104(a) to the extent that T determines that the adjustment is from only the capital appreciation resulting from the change in the portfolio's asset allocation. If T is unable to determine the extent to which capital appreciation resulted from the change in asset allocation or is unable to maintain adequate records to determine the extent to which principal distributions to G for dire emergencies do not exceed the 6% limitation, T may not exercise the power to adjust. See Joel C. Dobris, Limits on the Doctrine of Equitable Adjustment in Sophisticated Postmortem Tax Planning, 66 Iowa L. Rev. 273 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (5) — T is the trustee of a trust for the settlor's child. The trust owns a diversified portfolio of marketable financial assets with a value of $600,000, and is also the sole beneficiary of the settlor's IRA, which holds a diversified portfolio of marketable financial assets with a value of $900,000. The trust receives a distribution from the IRA that is the minimum amount required to be distributed under the Internal Revenue Code, and T allocates 10% of the distribution to income under Section 409(c) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1c" target="_self">35-6-409(c)</a></cite>]. The total return on the IRA's assets exceeds the amount distributed to the trust, and the value of the IRA at the end of the year is more than its value at the beginning of the year. Relevant factors that T may consider in determining whether to exercise the power to adjust and the extent to which an adjustment should be made to comply with Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>] include the total return from all of the trust's assets, those owned directly as well as its interest in the IRA, the extent to which the trust will be subject to income tax on the portion of the IRA distribution that is allocated to principal, and the extent to which the income beneficiary will be subject to income tax on the amount that T distributes to the income beneficiary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (6) — T is the trustee of a trust whose portfolio includes a large parcel of undeveloped real estate. T pays real property taxes on the undeveloped parcel from income each year pursuant to Section 501(3) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-501ol13" target="_self">35-6-501(3)</a></cite>]. After considering the return from the trust's portfolio as a whole and other relevant factors described in Section 104(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1b" target="_self">35-6-104(b)</a></cite>], T may exercise the power to adjust under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] to transfer cash from principal to income in order to distribute to the income beneficiary an amount that T considers necessary to comply with Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>].
       </p>
       <p>
        Example (7) — T is the trustee of a trust whose portfolio includes an interest in a mutual fund that is sponsored by T. As the manager of the mutual fund, T charges the fund a management fee that reduces the amount available to distribute to the trust by $2,000. If the fee had been paid directly by the trust, one-half of the fee would have been paid from income under Section 501(1) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-501ol11" target="_self">35-6-501(1)</a></cite>] and the other one-half would have been paid from principal under Section 502(a)(1) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-502ol1a1" target="_self">35-6-502(a)(1)</a></cite>]. After considering the total return from the portfolio as a whole and other relevant factors described in Section 104(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1b" target="_self">35-6-104(b)</a></cite>], T may exercise its power to adjust under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] by transferring $1,000, or half of the trust's proportionate share of the fee, from principal to income.

        <li id="t35c06s35-6-201ol11">
         A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in parts 3-5 of this chapter which apply to trustees and the rules in subdivision (5). The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.

         A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under subdivision (2) or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.

         A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subdivision (1) of this section because of a payment described in §§ 35-6-501 or 35-6-502 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

         Terminating income interests and successive income interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         A trust that provides for a single income beneficiary and an outright distribution of the remainder ends when the income interest ends. A more complex trust may have a number of income interests, either concurrent or successive, and the trust will not necessarily end when one of the income interests ends. For that reason, the Act speaks in terms of income interests ending and beginning rather than trusts ending and beginning. When an income interest in a trust ends, the trustee's powers continue during the winding up period required to complete its administration. A terminating income interest is one that has ended but whose administration is not complete.
        </p>
        <p>
         If two or more people are given the right to receive specified percentages or fractions of the income from a trust concurrently and one of the concurrent interests ends, e.g., when a beneficiary dies, the beneficiary's income interest ends but the trust does not. Similarly, when a trust with only one income beneficiary ends upon the beneficiary's death, the trust instrument may provide that part or all of the trust assets shall continue in trust for another income beneficiary. While it is common to think and speak of this (and even to characterize it in a trust instrument) as a “new” trust, it is a continuation of the original trust for a remainder beneficiary who has an income interest in the trust assets instead of the right to receive them outright. For purposes of this Act, this is a successive income interest in the same trust. The fact that a trust may or may not end when an income interest ends is not significant for purposes of this Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the assets that are subject to a terminating income interest pass to another trust because the income beneficiary exercises a general power of appointment over the trust assets, the recipient trust would be a new trust; and if they pass to another trust because the beneficiary exercises a nongeneral power of appointment over the trust assets, the recipient trust might be a new trust in some States (see 5A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 640, at 483 (4th ed. 1989)); but for purposes of this Act a new trust created in these circumstances is also a successive income interest.

         Gift of a pecuniary amount.

         Section 201(3) and (4) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201ol13" target="_self">35-6-201(3)</a></cite> and (4)] provide different rules for an outright gift of a pecuniary amount and a gift in trust of a pecuniary amount; this is the same approach used in Section 5(b)(2) of the 1962 Act.

         Interest on pecuniary amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 201(3) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201ol13" target="_self">35-6-201(3)</a></cite>] provides that the beneficiary of an outright pecuniary amount is to receive the interest or other amount provided by applicable law if there is no provision in the will or the terms of the trust. Many States have no applicable law that provides for interest or some other amount to be paid on an outright pecuniary gift under an inter vivos trust; this section provides that in such a case the interest or other amount to be paid shall be the same as the interest or other amount required to be paid on testamentary pecuniary gifts. This provision is intended to accord gifts under inter vivos instruments the same treatment as testamentary gifts. The various state authorities that provide for the amount that a beneficiary of an outright pecuniary amount is entitled to receive are collected in Richard B. Covey, Marital Deduction and Credit Shelter Dispositions and the Use of Formula Provisions, App. B (Supp. 1997).

         Administration expenses and interest on death taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under Section 201(2)(B) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201ol12B" target="_self">35-6-201(2)(B)</a></cite>] a fiduciary may pay administration expenses and interest on death taxes from either income or principal. An advantage of permitting the fiduciary to choose the source of the payment is that, if the fiduciary's decision is consistent with the decision to deduct these expenses for income tax purposes or estate tax purposes, it eliminates the need to adjust between principal and income that may arise when, for example, an expense that is paid from principal is deducted for income tax purposes or an expense that is paid from income is deducted for estate tax purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The United States Supreme Court has considered the question of whether an estate tax marital deduction or charitable deduction should be reduced when administration expenses are paid from income produced by property passing in trust for a surviving spouse or for charity and deducted for income tax purposes. The Court rejected the IRS position that administration expenses properly paid from income under the terms of the trust or state law must reduce the amount of a marital or charitable transfer, and held that the value of the transferred property is not reduced for estate tax purposes unless the administration expenses are material in light of the income the trust corpus could have been expected to generate. Commissioner v. Estate of Otis C. Hubert, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1124</cite> (1997). The provision in Section 201(2)(B) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201ol12B" target="_self">35-6-201(2)(B)</a></cite>] permits a fiduciary to pay and deduct administration expenses from income only to the extent that it will not cause the reduction or loss of an estate tax marital or charitable contributions deduction, which means that the limit on the amount payable from income will be established eventually by Treasury Regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Interest on estate taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The IRS agrees that interest on estate and inheritance taxes may be deducted for income tax purposes without having to reduce the estate tax deduction for amounts passing to a charity or surviving spouse, whether the interest is paid from principal or income. Rev. Rul. 93-48, 93-2 C.B. 270. For estates of persons who died before 1998, a fiduciary may not want to deduct for income tax purposes interest on estate tax that is deferred under Section 6166 or 6163 because deducting that interest for estate tax purposes may produce more beneficial results, especially if the estate has little or no income or the income tax bracket is significantly lower than the estate tax bracket. For estates of persons who die after 1997, no estate tax or income tax deduction will be allowed for interest paid on estate tax that is deferred under Section 6166. However, interest on estate tax deferred under Section 6163 will continue to be deductible for both purposes, and interest on estate tax deficiencies will continue to be deductible for estate tax purposes if an election under Section 6166 is not in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the 1962 Act, Section 13(c)(5) charges interest on estate and inheritance taxes to principal. The 1931 Act has no provision. Section 501(3) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-501ol13" target="_self">35-6-501(3)</a></cite>] provides that, except to the extent provided in Section 201(2)(B) or (C) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201ol12B" target="_self">35-6-201(2)(B)</a></cite>, (C)], all interest must be paid from income.

         Relationship to prior Acts.   Section 202 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-202" target="_self">35-6-202</a></cite>] retains the concept in Section 5(b)(2) of the 1962 Act that the residuary legatees of estates are to receive net income earned during the period of administration on the basis of their proportionate interests in the undistributed assets when distributions are made. It changes the basis for determining their proportionate interests by using asset values as of a date reasonably near the time of distribution instead of inventory values; it extends the application of these rules to distributions from terminating trusts; and it extends these rules to gain or loss realized from the disposition of assets during administration, an omission in the 1962 Act that has been noted by several commentators. See, e.g., Richard B. Covey, Marital Deduction and Credit Shelter Dispositions and the Use of Formula Provisions 80 (1984 &amp; Supp. 1997); Thomas H. Cantrill, Fractional or Percentage Residuary Bequests: Allocation of Postmortem Income, Gain and Unrealized Appreciation, 10 Prob. Notes 322, 327 (1985).

          Professor Bogert stated that “Section 4 of the [1962] Act makes a change with respect to the apportionment of the income of trust property not due until after the trust began but which accrued in part before the commencement of the trust. It treats such income as to be credited entirely to the income account in the case of a living trust, but to be apportioned between capital and income in the case of a testamentary trust. The [1931] Act apportions such income in the case of both types of trusts, except in the case of corporate dividends.” George G. Bogert, The Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act, 38 Notre Dame Law. 50, 52 (1962). The 1962 Act also provides that an asset passing to an inter vivos trust by a bequest in the settlor's will is governed by the rule that applies to a testamentary trust, so that different rules apply to assets passing to an inter vivos trust depending upon whether they were transferred to the trust during the settlor's life or by his will.

          Having several different rules that apply to similar transactions is confusing. In order to simplify administration, Section 302 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-302" target="_self">35-6-302</a></cite>] applies the same rule to inter vivos trusts (revocable and irrevocable), testamentary trusts, and assets that become subject to an inter vivos trust by a testamentary bequest.

          Periodic payments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under Section 302 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-302" target="_self">35-6-302</a></cite>], a periodic payment is principal if it is due but unpaid before a decedent dies or before an asset becomes subject to a trust, but the next payment is allocated entirely to income and is not apportioned. Thus, periodic receipts such as rents, dividends, interest, and annuities, and disbursements such as the interest portion of a mortgage payment, are not apportioned. This is the original common law rule. Edwin A. Howes, Jr., The American Law Relating to Income and Principal 70 (1905). In trusts in which a surviving spouse is dependent upon a regular flow of cash from the decedent's securities portfolio, this rule will help to maintain payments to the spouse at the same level as before the settlor's death. Under the 1962 Act, the pre-death portion of the first periodic payment due after death is apportioned to principal in the case of a testamentary trust or securities bequeathed by will to an inter vivos trust.

          Nonperiodic payments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the second sentence of Section 302(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-302ol1b" target="_self">35-6-302(b)</a></cite>], interest on an obligation that does not provide a due date for the interest payment, such as interest on an income tax refund, would be apportioned to principal to the extent it accrues before a person dies or an income interest begins unless the obligation is specifically given to a devisee or remainder beneficiary, in which case all of the accrued interest passes under Section 201(1) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201ol11" target="_self">35-6-201(1)</a></cite>] to the person who receives the obligation. The same rule applies to interest on an obligation that has a due date but does not provide for periodic payments. If there is no stated interest on the obligation, such as a zero coupon bond, and the proceeds from the obligation are received more than one year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, the entire amount received is principal under Section 406 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-406" target="_self">35-6-406</a></cite>].

          Prior Acts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Both the 1931 Act (Section 4) and the 1962 Act (Section 4(d)) provide that a deceased income beneficiary's estate is entitled to the undistributed income. The Drafting Committee concluded that this is probably not what most settlors would want, and that, with respect to undistributed income, most settlors would favor the income beneficiary first, the remainder beneficiaries second, and the income beneficiary's heirs last, if at all. However, it decided not to eliminate this provision to avoid causing disputes about whether the trustee should have distributed collected cash before the income beneficiary died.
         </p>
         <p>
          Accrued periodic payments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the prior Acts, an income beneficiary or his estate is entitled to receive a portion of any payments, other than dividends, that are due or that have accrued when the income interest terminates. The last sentence of subsection (a) changes that rule by providing that such items are not included in undistributed income. The items affected include periodic payments of interest, rent, and dividends, as well as items of income that accrue over a longer period of time; the rule also applies to expenses that are due or accrued.
         </p>
         <p>
          Example — accrued periodic payments. The rules in Section 302 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-302" target="_self">35-6-302</a></cite>] and Section 303 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-303" target="_self">35-6-303</a></cite>] work in the following manner: Assume that a periodic payment of rent that is due on July 20 has not been paid when an income interest ends on July 30; the successive income interest begins on July 31, and the rent payment that was due on July 20 is paid on August 3. Under Section 302(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-302" target="_self">35-6-302</a></cite>(a)], the July 20 payment is added to the principal of the successive income interest when received. Under Section 302(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-302ol1b" target="_self">35-6-302(b)</a></cite>], the entire periodic payment of rent that is due on August 20 is income when received by the successive income interest. Under Section 303 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-303" target="_self">35-6-303</a></cite>], neither the income beneficiary of the terminated income interest nor the beneficiary's estate is entitled to any part of either the July 20 or the August 20 payments because neither one was received before the income interest ended on July 30. The same principles apply to expenses of the trust.
         </p>
         <p>
          Beneficiary with an unqualified power to revoke.
         </p>
         <p>
          The requirement in subsection (b) to pay undistributed income to a mandatory income beneficiary or her estate does not apply to the extent the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. Without this exception, subsection (b) would apply to a revocable living trust whose settlor is the mandatory income beneficiary during her lifetime, even if her will provides that all of the assets in the probate estate are to be distributed to the trust.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a trust permits the beneficiary to withdraw all or a part of the trust principal after attaining a specified age and the beneficiary attains that age but fails to withdraw all of the principal that she is permitted to withdraw, a trustee is not required to pay her or her estate the undistributed income attributable to the portion of the principal that she left in the trust. The assumption underlying this rule is that the beneficiary has either provided for the disposition of the trust assets (including the undistributed income) by exercising a power of appointment that she has been given or has not withdrawn the assets because she is willing to have the principal and undistributed income be distributed under the terms of the trust. If the beneficiary has the power to withdraw 25% of the trust principal, the trustee must pay to her or her estate the undistributed income from the 75% that she cannot withdraw.

           Capital gain dividends.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under the Internal Revenue Code and the Income Tax Regulations, a “capital gain dividend” from a mutual fund or real estate investment trust is the excess of the fund's or trust's net long-term capital gain over its net short-term capital loss. As a result, a capital gain dividend does not include any net short-term capital gain, and cash received by a trust because of a net short-term capital gain is income under this Act.

          <p>
           If a trustee elects (or continues an election made by its predecessor) to reinvest dividends in shares of stock of a distributing corporation or fund, whether evidenced by new certificates or entries on the books of the distributing entity, the new shares would be principal, but the trustee may determine, after considering the return from the portfolio as a whole, whether an adjustment under Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] is necessary as a result.

           Distribution of property.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 1962 Act describes a number of types of property that would be principal if distributed by a corporation. This becomes unwieldy in a section that applies to both corporations and all other entities. By stating that principal includes the distribution of any property other than money, Section 401 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-401" target="_self">35-6-401</a></cite>] embraces all of the items enumerated in Section 6 of the 1962 Act as well as any other form of nonmonetary distribution not specifically mentioned in that Act.
          </p>
          <p>
           Partial liquidations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under subsection (d)(1), any distribution designated by the entity as a partial liquidating distribution is principal regardless of the percentage of total assets that it represents. If a distribution exceeds 20% of the entity's gross assets, the entire distribution is a partial liquidation under subsection (d)(2) whether or not the entity describes it as a partial liquidation. In determining whether a distribution is greater than 20% of the gross assets, the portion of the distribution that does not exceed the amount of income tax that the trustee or a beneficiary must pay on the entity's taxable income is ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
           Other large distributions.
          </p>
          <p>
           A cash distribution may be quite large (for example, more than 10% but not more than 20% of the entity's gross assets) and have characteristics that suggest it should be treated as principal rather than income. For example, an entity may have received cash from a source other than the conduct of its normal business operations because it sold an investment asset; or because it sold a business asset other than one held for sale to customers in the normal course of its business and did not replace it; or it borrowed a large sum of money and secured the repayment of the loan with a substantial asset; or a principal source of its cash was from assets such as mineral interests, 90% of which would have been allocated to principal if the trust had owned the assets directly. In such a case the trustee, after considering the total return from the portfolio as a whole and the income component of that return, may decide to exercise the power under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] to make an adjustment between income and principal, subject to the limitations in Section 104(c) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1c" target="_self">35-6-104(c)</a></cite>].

           Terms of the distributing trust or estate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under Section 103(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a" target="_self">35-6-103(a)</a></cite>], a trustee is to allocate receipts in accordance with the terms of the recipient trust or, if there is no provision, in accordance with this Act. However, in determining whether a distribution from another trust or an estate is income or principal, the trustee should also determine what the terms of the distributing trust or estate say about the distribution — for example, whether they direct that the distribution, even though made from the income of the distributing trust or estate, is to be added to principal of the recipient trust. Such a provision should override the terms of this Act, but if the terms of the recipient trust contain a provision requiring such a distribution to be allocated to income, the trustee may have to obtain a judicial resolution of the conflict between the terms of the two documents.

           Purpose and scope.
          </p>
          <p>
           The provisions in Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>] are intended to give greater flexibility to a trustee who operates a business or other activity in proprietorship form rather than in a wholly-owned corporation (or, where permitted by state law, a single-member limited liability company), and to facilitate the trustee's ability to decide the extent to which the net receipts from the activity should be allocated to income, just as the board of directors of a corporation owned entirely by the trust would decide the amount of the annual dividend to be paid to the trust. It permits a trustee to account for farming or livestock operations, rental properties, oil and gas properties, timber operations, and activities in derivatives and options as though they were held by a separate entity. It is not intended, however, to permit a trustee to account separately for a traditional securities portfolio to avoid the provisions of this Act that apply to such securities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>] permits the trustee to account separately for each business or activity for which the trustee determines separate accounting is appropriate. A trustee with a computerized accounting system may account for these activities in a “subtrust”; an individual trustee may continue to use the business and record-keeping methods employed by the decedent or transferor who may have conducted the business under an assumed name. The intent of this section is to give the trustee broad authority to select business record-keeping methods that best suit the activity in which the trustee is engaged.
          </p>
          <p>
           If a fiduciary liquidates a sole proprietorship or other activity to which Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>] applies, the proceeds would be added to principal, even though derived from the liquidation of accounts receivable, because the proceeds would no longer be needed in the conduct of the business. If the liquidation occurs during probate or during an income interest's winding up period, none of the proceeds would be income for purposes of Section 201 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-201" target="_self">35-6-201</a></cite>].
          </p>
          <p>
           Separate accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
           A trustee may or may not maintain separate bank accounts for business activities that are accounted for under Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>]. A professional trustee may decide not to maintain separate bank accounts, but an individual trustee, especially one who has continued a decedent's business practices, may continue the same banking arrangements that were used during the decedent's lifetime. In either case, the trustee is authorized to decide to what extent cash is to be retained as part of the business assets and to what extent it is to be transferred to the trust's general accounts, either as income or principal.

           A portion of the payment under a lease may be a reimbursement of principal expenditures for improvements to the leased property that is characterized as rent for purposes of invoking contractual or statutory remedies for nonpayment. If the trustee is accounting for rental income under Section 405 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-405" target="_self">35-6-405</a></cite>], a transfer from income to reimburse principal may be appropriate under Section 504 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-405" target="_self">35-6-405</a></cite>] to the extent that some of the “rent” is really a reimbursement for improvements.

           Variable or floating interest rates.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reference in subsection (a) to variable or floating interest rate obligations is intended to clarify that, even though an obligation's interest rate may change from time to time based upon changes in an index or other market indicator, an obligation to pay money containing a variable or floating rate provision is subject to this section and is not to be treated as a derivative financial instrument under Section 414 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-414" target="_self">35-6-414</a></cite>].

           Discount obligations.

          <p>
           Subsection (b) applies to all obligations acquired at a discount, including short-term obligations such as U.S. Treasury Bills, long-term obligations such as U.S. Savings Bonds, zero-coupon bonds, and discount bonds that pay interest during part, but not all, of the period before maturity. Under subsection (b), the entire increase in value of these obligations is principal when the trustee receives the proceeds from the disposition unless the obligation, when acquired, has a maturity of less than one year. In order to have one rule that applies to all discount obligations, the Act eliminates the provision in the 1962 Act for the payment from principal of an amount equal to the increase in the value of U.S. Series E bonds. The provision for bonds that mature within one year after acquisition by the trustee is derived from the Illinois act. 760 ILCS 1½ (1996).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (b) also applies to inflation-indexed bonds — any increase in principal due to inflation after issuance is principal upon redemption if the bond matures more than one year after the trustee acquires it; if it matures within one year, all of the increase, including any attributable to an inflation adjustment, is income.

          <p>
           This section is intended to relieve a trustee from making relatively small allocations while preserving the trustee's right to do so if an allocation is large in terms of absolute dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, assume that a trust's assets, which include a working interest in an oil well, have a value of $1,000,000; the net income from the assets other than the working interest is $40,000; and the net receipts from the working interest are $400. The trustee may allocate all of the net receipts from the working interest to principal instead of allocating 10%, or $40, to income under Section 411 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-411" target="_self">35-6-411</a></cite>]. If the net receipts from the working interest are $35,000, so that the amount allocated to income under Section 411 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-411" target="_self">35-6-411</a></cite>] would be $3,500, the trustee may decide that this amount is sufficiently significant to the income beneficiary that the allocation provided for by Section 411 [§ 35-6-411] should be made, even though the trustee is still permitted under Section 408 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-408" target="_self">35-6-408</a></cite>] to allocate all of the net receipts to principal because the $3,500 would increase the net income of $40,000, as determined before making an allocation under Section 411 [§ 35-6-411], by less than 10%. Section 408 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-408" target="_self">35-6-408</a></cite>] will also relieve a trustee from having to allocate net receipts from the sale of trees in a small woodlot between principal and income.
          </p>
          <p>
           While the allocation to principal of small amounts under this section should not be a cause for concern for tax purposes, allocations are not permitted under this section in circumstances described in Section 104(c) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1c" target="_self">35-6-104(c)</a></cite>] to eliminate claims that the power in this section has adverse tax consequences.

           Section 409 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409" target="_self">35-6-409</a></cite>] applies to amounts received under contractual arrangements that provide for payments to a third party beneficiary as a result of services rendered or property transferred to the payer. While the right to receive such payments is a liquidating asset of the kind described in Section 410 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-410" target="_self">35-6-410</a></cite>] (i.e., “an asset whose value will diminish or terminate because the asset is expected to produce receipts for a period of limited duration”), these payment rights are covered separately in Section 409 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409" target="_self">35-6-409</a></cite>] because of their special characteristics.

          <p>
           Section 409 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409" target="_self">35-6-409</a></cite>] applies to receipts from all forms of annuities and deferred compensation arrangements, whether the payment will be received by the trust in a lump sum or in installments over a period of years. It applies to bonuses that may be received over two or three years and payments that may last for much longer periods, including payments from an individual retirement account (IRA), deferred compensation plan (whether qualified or not qualified for special federal income tax treatment), and insurance renewal commissions. It applies to a retirement plan to which the settlor has made contributions, just as it applies to an annuity policy that the settlor may have purchased individually, and it applies to variable annuities, deferred annuities, annuities issued by commercial insurance companies, and “private annuities” arising from the sale of property to another individual or entity in exchange for payments that are to be made for the life of one or more individuals. The section applies whether the payments begin when the payment right becomes subject to the trust or are deferred until a future date, and it applies whether payments are made in cash or in kind, such as employer stock (in-kind payments usually will be made in a single distribution that will be allocated to principal under the second sentence of subsection (c)).

           The 1962 Act.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under Section 12 of the 1962 Act, receipts from “rights to receive payments on a contract for deferred compensation” are allocated to income each year in an amount “not in excess of 5% per year” of the property's inventory value. While “not in excess of 5%” suggests that the annual allocation may range from zero to 5% of the inventory value, in practice the rule is usually treated as prescribing a 5% allocation. The inventory value is usually the present value of all the future payments, and since the inventory value is determined as of the date on which the payment right becomes subject to the trust, the inventory value, and thus the amount of the annual income allocation, depends significantly on the applicable interest rate on the decedent's date of death. That rate may be much higher or lower than the average long-term interest rate. The amount determined under the 5% formula tends to become fixed and remain unchanged even though the amount received by the trust increases or decreases.

           Section 409(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1b" target="_self">35-6-409(b)</a></cite>] applies to plans whose terms characterize payments made under the plan as dividends, interest, or payments in lieu of dividends or interest. For example, some deferred compensation plans that hold debt obligations or stock of the plan's sponsor in an account for future delivery to the person rendering the services provide for the annual payment to that person of dividends received on the stock or interest received on the debt obligations. Other plans provide that the account of the person rendering the services shall be credited with “phantom” shares of stock and require an annual payment that is equivalent to the dividends that would be received on that number of shares if they were actually issued; or a plan may entitle the person rendering the services to receive a fixed dollar amount in the future and provide for the annual payment of interest on the deferred amount during the period prior to its payment. Under Section 409(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1b" target="_self">35-6-409(b)</a></cite>], payments of dividends, interest or payments in lieu of dividends or interest under plans of this type are allocated to income; all other payments received under these plans are allocated to principal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 409(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1b" target="_self">35-6-409(b)</a></cite>] does not apply to an IRA or an arrangement with payment provisions similar to an IRA. IRAs and similar arrangements are subject to the provisions in Section 409(c) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1c" target="_self">35-6-409(c)</a></cite>].

          </p>
          <p>
           The focus of Section 409 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409" target="_self">35-6-409</a></cite>], for purposes of allocating payments received by a trust to or between principal and income, is on the payment right rather than on assets that may be held in a fund from which the payments are made. Thus, if an IRA holds a portfolio of marketable stocks and bonds, the amount received by the IRA as dividends and interest is not taken into account in determining the principal and income allocation except to the extent that the Internal Revenue Service may require them to be taken into account when the payment is received by a trust that qualifies for the estate tax marital deduction (a situation that is provided for in Section 409(d) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1d" target="_self">35-6-409(d)</a></cite>]). An IRA is subject to federal income tax rules that require payments to begin by a particular date and be made over a specific number of years or a period measured by the lives of one or more persons. The payment right of a trust that is named as a beneficiary of an IRA is not a right to receive particular items that are paid to the IRA, but is instead the right to receive an amount determined by dividing the value of the IRA by the remaining number of years in the payment period. This payment right is similar to the right to receive a unitrust amount, which is normally expressed as an amount equal to a percentage of the value of the unitrust assets without regard to dividends or interest that may be received by the unitrust.
          </p>
          <p>
           An amount received from an IRA or a plan with a payment provision similar to that of an IRA is allocated under Section 409(c) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1c" target="_self">35-6-409(c)</a></cite>], which differentiates between payments that are required to be made and all other payments. To the extent that a payment is required to be made (either under federal income tax rules or, in the case of a plan that is not subject to those rules, under the terms of the plan), 10% of the amount received is allocated to income and the balance is allocated to principal. All other payments are allocated to principal because they represent a change in the form of a principal asset; Section 409 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409" target="_self">35-6-409</a></cite>] follows the rule in Section 404(2) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-404ol12" target="_self">35-6-404(2)</a></cite>], which provides that money or property received from a change in the form of a principal asset be allocated to principal.

           Section 409(c) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409ol1c" target="_self">35-6-409(c)</a></cite>] produces an allocation to income that is similar to the allocation under the 1962 Act formula if the annual payments are the same throughout the payment period, and it is simpler to administer. The amount allocated to income under Section 409 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-409" target="_self">35-6-409</a></cite>] is not dependent upon the interest rate that is used for valuation purposes when the decedent dies, and if the payments received by the trust increase or decrease from year to year because the fund from which the payment is made increases or decreases in value, the amount allocated to income will also increase or decrease.

           Marital deduction requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
           When an IRA or other retirement arrangement (a “plan”) is payable to a marital deduction trust, the IRS treats the plan as a separate property interest that itself must qualify for the marital deduction.  IRS Revenue Ruling 2006-26 said that, as written, Section 409 does not cause a trust to qualify for the IRS’ safe harbors.  Revenue Ruling 2006-26 was limited in scope to certain situations involving IRAs and defined contribution retirement plans.  Without necessarily agreeing with the IRS’ position in that ruling, the revision to this section is designed to satisfy the IRS’ safe harbor and to address concerns that might be raised for similar assets.  No IRS pronouncements have addressed the scope of Code § 2056(b)(7)(C).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (f) requires the trustee to demand certain distributions if the surviving spouse so requests.  The safe harbor of Revenue Ruling 2006-26 requires that the surviving spouse be separately entitled to demand the fund’s income (without regard to the income from the trust’s other assets) and the income from the other assets (without regard to the fund’s income).  In any event, the surviving spouse is not required to demand that the trustee distribute all of the fund’s income from the fund or from other trust assets.  Treas. Reg. § 20.2056(b)-5(f)(8).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (f) also recognizes that the trustee might not control the payments that the trustee receives and provides a remedy to the surviving spouse if the distributions under subsection (d)(1) are insufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (g) addresses situations where, due to lack of information provided by the fund’s administrator, the trustee is unable to determine the fund’s actual income. The bracketed language is the range approved for unitrust payments by Treas. Reg. § 1.643(b)-1.  In determining the value for purposes of applying the unitrust percentage, the trustee would seek to obtain the value of the assets as of the most recent statement of value immediately preceding the beginning of the year.  For example, suppose a trust’s accounting period is January 1 through December 31.  If a retirement plan administrator furnishes information annually each September 30 and declines to provide information as of December 31, then the trustee may rely on the September 30 value to determine the distribution for the following year.  For funds whose values are not readily available, subsection (g) relies on Code section 7520 valuation methods because many funds described in Section 409 are annuities, and one consistent set of valuation principles should apply whether or not the fund is, in fact, an annuity.

           Section 11 of the 1962 Act allocates receipts from “property subject to depletion” to income in an amount “not in excess of 5%” of the asset's inventory value. The 1931 Act has a similar 5% rule that applies when the trustee is under a duty to change the form of the investment. The 5% rule imposes on a trust the obligation to pay a fixed annuity to the income beneficiary until the asset is exhausted. Under both the 1931 and 1962 Acts the balance of each year's receipts is added to principal. A fixed payment can produce unfair results. The remainder beneficiary receives all of the receipts from unexpected growth in the asset, e.g., if royalties on a patent or copyright increase significantly. Conversely, if the receipts diminish more rapidly than expected, most of the amount received by the trust will be allocated to income and little to principal. Moreover, if the annual payments remain the same for the life of the asset, the amount allocated to principal will usually be less than the original inventory value. For these reasons, Section 410 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-410" target="_self">35-6-410</a></cite>] abandons the annuity approach under the 5% rule.

          <p>
           The 1962 Act allocates to principal as a depletion allowance, 27-½% of the gross receipts, but not more than 50% of the net receipts after paying expenses. The Internal Revenue Code no longer provides for a 27-½% depletion allowance, although the major oil-producing States have retained the 27-½% provision in their principal and income acts (Texas amended its Act in 1993, but did not change the depletion provision). Section 9 of the 1931 Act allocates all of the net proceeds received as consideration for the “permanent severance of natural resources from the lands” to principal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 411 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-411" target="_self">35-6-411</a></cite>] allocates 90% of the net receipts to principal and 10% to income. A depletion provision that is tied to past or present Code provisions is undesirable because it causes a large portion of the oil and gas receipts to be paid out as income. As wells are depleted, the amount received by the income beneficiary falls drastically. Allocating a larger portion of the receipts to principal enables the trustee to acquire other income producing assets that will continue to produce income when the mineral reserves are exhausted.

           Application of Sections 403 and 408 [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-408" target="_self">35-6-408</a></cite>].

Instead, such receipts are to be allocated to or between principal and income in accordance with the provisions of this Act. For a discussion of the open mine doctrine, see generally 3A Austin W. Scott &amp; William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 239.3 (4th ed. 1988), and Nutter v. Stockton, 626 P.2d 861 (Okla. 1981).

          </p>
          <p>
           Section 9(b) of the 1962 Act provides that the natural resources provision does not apply to property interests held by the trust on the effective date of the Act, which reflects concerns about the constitutionality of applying a retroactive administrative provision to interests in real estate, based on the opinion in the Oklahoma case of Franklin v. Margay Oil Corporation, 153 P.2d 486, 501 (Okla. 1944). Section 411(d) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-411ol1d" target="_self">35-6-411(d)</a></cite>] permits a trustee to use either the method provided for in this Act or the method used before the Act takes effect. Lawyers in jurisdictions other than Oklahoma may conclude that retroactivity is not a problem as to property situated in their States, and this provision permits trustees to decide, based on advice from counsel in States whose law may be different from that of Oklahoma, whether they may apply this provision retroactively if they conclude that to do so is in the best interests of the beneficiaries.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the property is in a State other than the State where the trust is administered, the trustee must be aware that the law of the property's situs may control this question. The outcome turns on a variety of questions: whether the terms of the trust specify that the law of a State other than the situs of the property shall govern the administration of the trust, and whether the courts will follow the terms of the trust; whether the trust's asset is the land itself or a leasehold interest in the land (as it frequently is with oil and gas property); whether a leasehold interest or its proceeds should be classified as real property or personal property, and if as personal property, whether applicable state law treats it as a movable or an immovable for conflict of laws purposes. See 5A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts §§ 648, at 531, 533-534; § 657, at 600 (4th ed. 1989).

           The rules in Section 412 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-412" target="_self">35-6-412</a></cite>] are intended to apply to net receipts from the sale of trees and by-products from harvesting and processing trees without regard to the kind of trees that are cut or whether the trees are cut before or after a particular number of years of growth. The rules apply to the sale of trees that are expected to produce lumber for building purposes, trees sold as pulpwood, and Christmas and other ornamental trees. Subsection (a) applies to net receipts from property owned by the trustee and property leased by the trustee. The Act is not intended to prevent a tenant in possession of the property from using wood that he cuts on the property for personal, noncommercial purposes, such as a Christmas tree, firewood, mending old fences or building new fences, or making repairs to structures on the property.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under subsection (a), the amount of net receipts allocated to income depends upon whether the amount of timber removed is more or less than the rate of growth. The method of determining the amount of timber removed and the rate of growth is up to the trustee, based on methods customarily used for the kind of timber involved.

The option to account for net receipts separately under Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>] takes into consideration the possibility that timber harvesting operations may have been conducted before the timber property became subject to the trust, and that it may make sense to continue using accounting methods previously established for the property. It also permits a trustee to use customary accounting practices for timber operations even if no harvesting occurred on the property before it became subject to the trust.

           Prior Acts' Conflict with Uniform Prudent Investor Act.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 2(b) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act provides that “[a] trustee's investment and management decisions respecting individual assets must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the trust portfolio as a whole ….” The underproductive property provisions in Section 12 of the 1962 Act and Section 11 of the 1931 Act give the income beneficiary a right to receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of underproductive property as “delayed income.” In each Act the provision applies on an asset by asset basis and not by taking into consideration the trust portfolio as a whole, which conflicts with the basic precept in Section 2(b) of the Prudent Investor Act. Moreover, in determining the amount of delayed income, the prior Acts do not permit a trustee to take into account the extent to which the trustee may have distributed principal to the income beneficiary, under principal invasion provisions in the terms of the trust, to compensate for insufficient income from the unproductive asset. Under Section 104(b)(7) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1b7" target="_self">35-6-104(b)(7)</a></cite>], a trustee must consider prior distributions of principal to the income beneficiary in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust conferred by Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>].
          </p>
          <p>
           Duty to make property productive of income. In order to implement the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, this Act abolishes the right to receive delayed income from the sale proceeds of an asset that produces little or no income, but it does not alter existing state law regarding the income beneficiary's right to compel the trustee to make property productive of income. As the law continues to develop in this area, the duty to make property productive of current income in a particular situation should be determined by taking into consideration the performance of the portfolio as a whole and the extent to which a trustee makes principal distributions to the income beneficiary under the terms of the trust and adjustments between principal and income under Section 104 of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>].
          </p>
          <p>
           Trusts for which the value of the right to receive income is important for tax reasons may be affected by Reg. § 1.7520-3(b)(2)(v) Example (1), § 20.7520-3(b)(2)(v) Examples (1) and (2), and § 25.7520-3(b)(2)(v) Examples (1) and (2), which provide that if the income beneficiary does not have the right to compel the trustee to make the property productive, the income interest is considered unproductive and may not be valued actuarially under those sections.

           Marital deduction trusts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (a) draws on language in Reg. § 20.2056(b)-5(f)(4) and (5) to enable a trust for a surviving spouse to qualify for a marital deduction if applicable state law is unclear about the surviving spouse's right to compel the trustee to make property productive of income. The trustee should also consider the application of Section 104 of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] and the provisions of Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 240, at 186, app. § 240, at 252 (1992). Example (6) in the Comment to Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>] describes a situation involving the payment from income of carrying charges on unproductive real estate in which Section 104 [§ 35-6-104] may apply.
          </p>
          <p>
           Once the two conditions have occurred — insufficient beneficial enjoyment from the property and the spouse's demand that the trustee take action under this section — the trustee must act; but instead of the formulaic approach of the 1962 Act, which is triggered only if the trustee sells the property, this Act permits the trustee to decide whether to make the property productive of income, convert it, transfer funds from principal to income, or to take some combination of those actions. The trustee may rely on the power conferred by Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] to adjust from principal to income if the trustee decides that it is not feasible or appropriate to make the property productive of income or to convert the property. Given the purpose of Section 413 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-413" target="_self">35-6-413</a></cite>], the power under Section 104(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104ol1a" target="_self">35-6-104(a)</a></cite>] would be exercised to transfer principal to income and not to transfer income to principal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 413 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-413" target="_self">35-6-413</a></cite>] does not apply to a so-called “estate” trust, which will qualify for the marital deduction, even though the income may be accumulated for a term of years or for the life of the surviving spouse, if the terms of the trust require the principal and undistributed income to be paid to the surviving spouse's estate when the spouse dies. Reg. § 20.2056(c)-2(b)(1)(iii).

           Scope and application.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is difficult to predict how frequently and to what extent trustees will invest directly in derivative financial instruments rather than participating indirectly through investment entities that may utilize these instruments in varying degrees. If the trust participates in derivatives indirectly through an entity, an amount received from the entity will be allocated under Section 401 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-401" target="_self">35-6-401</a></cite>] and not Section 414 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-414" target="_self">35-6-414</a></cite>]. If a trustee invests directly in derivatives to a significant extent, the expectation is that receipts and disbursements related to derivatives will be accounted for under Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>]; if a trustee chooses not to account under Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>], Section 414(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-414" target="_self">35-6-414</a></cite>(b)] provides the default rule. Certain types of option transactions in which trustees may engage are dealt with in subsection (c) to distinguish those transactions from ones involving options that are embedded in derivative financial instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
           Definition of “derivative.”
          </p>
          <p>
           “Derivative” is a difficult term to define because new derivatives are invented daily as dealers tailor their terms to achieve specific financial objectives for particular clients. Since derivatives are typically contract-based, a derivative can probably be devised for almost any set of objectives if another party can be found who is willing to assume the obligations required to meet those objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most comprehensive definition of derivative is in the Exposure Draft of a Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards titled “Accounting for Derivative and Similar Financial Instruments and for Hedging Activities,” which was released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on June 20, 1996 (No. 162-B). The definition in Section 414(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-414ol1a" target="_self">35-6-414(a)</a></cite>] is derived in part from the FASB definition. The purpose of the definition in subsection (a) is to implement the substantive rule in subsection (b) that provides for all receipts and disbursements to be allocated to principal to the extent the trustee elects not to account for transactions in derivatives under Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>]. As a result, it is much shorter than the FASB definition, which serves much more ambitious objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
           A derivative is frequently described as including futures, forwards, swaps and options, terms that also require definition, and the definition in this Act avoids these terms. FASB used the same approach, explaining in paragraph 65 of the Exposure Draft:
          </p>
          <p>
           The definition of derivative financial instrument in this Statement includes those financial instruments generally considered to be derivatives, such as forwards, futures, swaps, options, and similar instruments. The Board considered defining a derivative financial instrument by merely referencing those commonly understood instruments, similar to paragraph 5 of Statement 119, which says that “… a derivative financial instrument is a futures, forward, swap, or option contract, or other financial instrument with similar characteristics.” However, the continued development of financial markets and innovative financial instruments could ultimately render a definition based on examples inadequate and obsolete. The Board, therefore, decided to base the definition of a derivative financial instrument on a description of the common characteristics of those instruments in order to accommodate the accounting for newly developed derivatives. (Footnote omitted.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Marking to market.
          </p>
          <p>
           A gain or loss that occurs because the trustee marks securities to market or to another value during an accounting period is not a transaction in a derivative financial instrument that is income or principal under the Act — only cash receipts and disbursements, and the receipt of property in exchange for a principal asset, affect a trust's principal and income accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Receipt of property other than cash.
          </p>
          <p>
           If a trustee receives property other than cash upon the settlement of a derivatives transaction, that property would be principal under Section 404(2) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-404ol12" target="_self">35-6-404(2)</a></cite>].
          </p>
          <p>
           Options.
          </p>
          <p>
           Options to which subsection (c) applies include an option to purchase real estate owned by the trustee and a put option purchased by a trustee to guard against a drop in value of a large block of marketable stock that must be liquidated to pay estate taxes. Subsection (c) would also apply to a continuing and regular practice of selling call options on securities owned by the trust if the terms of the option require delivery of the securities. It does not apply if the consideration received or given for the option is something other than cash or property, such as cross-options granted in a buy-sell agreement between owners of an entity.

           Scope of section.    Typical asset-backed securities include arrangements in which debt obligations such as real estate mortgages, credit card receivables and auto loans are acquired by an investment trust and interests in the trust are sold to investors. The source for payments to an investor is the money received from principal and interest payments on the underlying debt. An asset-backed security includes an “interest only” or a “principal only” security that permits the investor to receive only the interest payments received from the bonds, mortgages or other assets that are the collateral for the asset-backed security, or only the principal payments made on those collateral assets. An asset-backed security also includes a security that permits the investor to participate in either the capital appreciation of an underlying security or in the interest or dividend return from such a security, such as the “Primes” and “Scores” issued by Americus Trust. An asset-backed security does not include an interest in a corporation, partnership, or an investment trust described in the Comment to Section 402 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-402" target="_self">35-6-402</a></cite>], whose assets consist significantly or entirely of investment assets. Receipts from an instrument that do not come within the scope of this section or any other section of the Act would be allocated entirely to principal under the rule in Section 103(a)(4) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1a4" target="_self">35-6-103(a)(4)</a></cite>], and the trustee may then consider whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust in Section 104 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite>], taking into account the return from the portfolio as whole and other relevant factors.

            Environmental expenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            All environmental expenses are payable from principal, subject to the power of the trustee to transfer funds to principal from income under Section 504 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-504" target="_self">35-6-504</a></cite>]. However, the Drafting Committee decided that it was not necessary to broaden this provision to cover other expenditures made under compulsion of governmental authority. See generally the annotation at 43 A.L.R.4th 1012 (Duty as Between Life Tenant and Remainderman with Respect to Cost of Improvements or Repairs Made Under Compulsion of Governmental Authority).
           </p>
           <p>
            Environmental expenses paid by a trust are to be paid from principal under Section 502(a)(7) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-502ol1a7" target="_self">35-6-502(a)(7)</a></cite>] on the assumption that they will usually be extraordinary in nature. Environmental expenses might be paid from income if the trustee is carrying on a business that uses or sells toxic substances, in which case environmental cleanup costs would be a normal cost of doing business and would be accounted for under Section 403 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-403" target="_self">35-6-403</a></cite>]. In accounting under that Section, environmental costs will be a factor in determining how much of the net receipts from the business is trust income. Paying all other environmental expenses from principal is consistent with this Act's approach regarding receipts — when a receipt is not clearly a current return on a principal asset, it should be added to principal because over time both the income and remainder beneficiaries benefit from this treatment. Here, allocating payments required by environmental laws to principal imposes the detriment of those payments over time on both the income and remainder beneficiaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under Sections 504(a) and 504(b)(5) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-504ol1a" target="_self">35-6-504(a)</a></cite>, (b)(5)], a trustee who makes or expects to make a principal disbursement for an environmental expense described in Section 502(a)(7) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-502ol1a7" target="_self">35-6-502(a)(7)</a></cite>] is authorized to transfer an appropriate amount from income to principal to reimburse principal for disbursements made or to provide a reserve for future principal disbursements.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first part of Section 502(a)(7) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-502ol1a7" target="_self">35-6-502(a)(7)</a></cite>] is based upon the definition of an “environmental remediation trust” in Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-4(e) (as amended in 1996). This is not because the Act applies to an environmental remediation trust, but because the definition is a useful and thoroughly vetted description of the kinds of expenses that a trustee owning contaminated property might incur. Expenses incurred to comply with environmental laws include the cost of environmental consultants, administrative proceedings and burdens of every kind imposed as the result of an administrative or judicial proceeding, even though the burden is not formally characterized as a penalty.

            Prior Acts.    The 1931 Act has no provision for depreciation. Section 13(a)(2) of the 1962 Act provides that a charge shall be made against income for “… a reasonable allowance for depreciation on property subject to depreciation under generally accepted accounting principles ….” That provision has been resisted by many trustees, who do not provide for any depreciation for a variety of reasons. One reason relied upon is that a charge for depreciation is not needed to protect the remainder beneficiaries if the value of the land is increasing; another is that generally accepted accounting principles may not require depreciation to be taken if the property is not part of a business. The Drafting Committee concluded that the decision to provide for depreciation should be discretionary with the trustee. The power to transfer funds from income to principal that is granted by this section is a discretionary power of administration referred to in Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>], and in exercising the power a trustee must comply with Section 103(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-103ol1b" target="_self">35-6-103(b)</a></cite>].
           </p>
           <p>
            One purpose served by transferring cash from income to principal for depreciation is to provide funds to pay the principal of an indebtedness secured by the depreciable property. Section 504(b)(4) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-504ol1b4" target="_self">35-6-504(b)(4)</a></cite>] permits the trustee to transfer additional cash from income to principal for this purpose to the extent that the amount transferred from income to principal for depreciation is less than the amount of the principal payments.

            Taxes on Undistributed Entity Taxable Income.    When a trust owns an interest in a pass-through entity, such as a partnership or S corporation, it must report its share of the entity’s taxable income regardless of how much the entity distributes to the trust. Whether the entity distributes more or less than the trust’s tax on its share of the entity’s taxable income, the trust must pay the taxes and allocate them between income and principal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subsection (c) requires the trust to pay the taxes on its share of an entity’s taxable income from income or principal receipts to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocable to each. This assures the trust a source of cash to pay some or all of the taxes on its share of the entity’s taxable income. Subsection (d) recognizes that, except in the case of an Electing Small Business Trust (ESBT), a trust normally receives a deduction for amounts distributed to a beneficiary. Accordingly, subsection (d) requires the trust to increase receipts payable to a beneficiary as determined under subsection (c) to the extent the trust’s taxes are reduced by distributing those receipts to the beneficiary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because the trust’s taxes and amounts distributed to a beneficiary are interrelated, the trust may be required to apply a formula to determine the correct amount payable to a beneficiary.  This formula should take into account that each time a distribution is made to a beneficiary, the trust taxes are reduced and amounts distributable to a beneficiary are increased.  The formula assures that after deducting distributions to a beneficiary, the trust has enough to satisfy its taxes on its share of the entity’s taxable income as reduced by distributions to beneficiaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example (1)  –  Trust T receives a Schedule K-1 from Partnership P reflecting taxable income of $1 million. Partnership P distributes $100,000 to T, which allocates the receipts to income. Both Trust T and income Beneficiary B are in the 35 percent tax bracket. Trust T’s tax on $1 million of taxable income if $350,000. Under Subsection (c) T’s tax must be paid from income receipts because receipts from the entity are allocated only to income. Therefore, T must apply the entire $100,000 of income receipts to pay its tax.  In this case, Beneficiary B receives nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example (2)  –  Trust T receives a Schedule K-1 from Partnership P reflecting taxable income of $1 million. Partnership P distributes $500,000 to T, which allocates the receipts to income. Both Trust T and income Beneficiary B are in the 35 percent tax bracket. Trust T’s tax on $1 million of taxable income is $350,000. Under Subsection (c), T’s tax must be paid from income receipts because receipts from P are allocated only to income. Therefore, T uses $350,000 of the $500,000 to pay its taxes and distributes the remaining $150,000 to B. The $150,000 payment to B reduces T’s taxes by $52,500, which it must pay to B. But the $52,500 further reduces T’s taxes by $18,375, which it also must pay to B. In fact, each time T makes a distribution to B, its taxes are further reduced, causing another payment to be due B.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alternatively, T can apply the following algebraic formula to determine the amount payable to B:
           </p>
           <p>
            D = (C-R*K)/(1-R)
           </p>
           <p>
            D = Distribution to income beneficiary
           </p>
           <p>
            C = Cash paid by the entity to the trust
           </p>
           <p>
            R = tax rate on income
           </p>
           <p>
            K = entity’s K-1 taxable income
           </p>
           <p>
            Applying the formula to Example (2) above, Trust T must pay $230,769 to B so that after deducting the payment, T has exactly enough to pay its tax on the remaining taxable income from P.

            Payable to the Beneficiary  $ 230,769
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, B will report $230,769 on his or her own personal income tax return, paying taxes of $80,769. Because Trust T withheld $269,231 to pay its taxes and B paid $80,769 taxes of its own, B bore the entire $350,000 tax burden on the $1 million of entity taxable income, including the $500,000 that the entity retained that presumably increased the value of the trust’s investment entity.
           </p>
           <p>
            If a trustee determines that it is appropriate to do so, it should consider exercising the discretion granted in T.C.A. Section 35-6-506 to adjust between income and principal. Alternatively, the trustee may exercise the power to adjust under T.C.A. Section 35-6-104 to the extent it is available and appropriate under the circumstances, including whether a future distribution from the entity that would be allocated to principal should be reallocated to income because the income beneficiary already bore the burden of taxes on the reinvested income. In exercising the power, the trust should consider the impact that future distributions will have on any current adjustments.

            Discretionary adjustments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Section 506(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-506ol1a" target="_self">35-6-506(a)</a></cite>] permits the fiduciary to make adjustments between income and principal because of tax law provisions. It would permit discretionary adjustments in situations like these: (1) A fiduciary elects to deduct administration expenses that are paid from principal on an income tax return instead of on the estate tax return; (2) a distribution of a principal asset to a trust or other beneficiary causes the taxable income of an estate or trust to be carried out to the distributee and relieves the persons who receive the income of any obligation to pay income tax on the income; or (3) a trustee realizes a capital gain on the sale of a principal asset and pays a large state income tax on the gain, but under applicable federal income tax rules the trustee may not deduct the state income tax payment from the capital gain in calculating the trust's federal capital gain tax, and the income beneficiary receives the benefit of the deduction for state income tax paid on the capital gain. See generally Joel C. Dobris, Limits on the Doctrine of Equitable Adjustment in Sophisticated Postmortem Tax Planning, 66 Iowa L. Rev. 273 (1981).
           </p>
           <p>
            Section 506(a)(3) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-506ol1a3" target="_self">35-6-506(a)(3)</a></cite>] applies to a qualified Subchapter S trust (QSST) whose income beneficiary is required to include a pro rata share of the S corporation's taxable income in his return. If the QSST does not receive a cash distribution from the corporation that is large enough to cover the income beneficiary's tax liability, the trustee may distribute additional cash from principal to the income beneficiary. In this case the retention of cash by the corporation benefits the trust principal. This situation could occur if the corporation's taxable income includes capital gain from the sale of a business asset and the sale proceeds are reinvested in the business instead of being distributed to shareholders.
           </p>

            Mandatory adjustment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subsection (b) provides for a mandatory adjustment from income to principal to the extent needed to preserve an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contributions deduction. It is derived from New York's EPTL § 11-1.2 (A), which requires principal to be reimbursed by those who benefit when a fiduciary elects to deduct administration expenses on an income tax return instead of the estate tax return. Unlike the New York provision, subsection (b) limits a mandatory reimbursement to cases in which a marital deduction or a charitable contributions deduction is reduced by the payment of additional estate taxes because of the fiduciary's income tax election. It is intended to preserve the result reached in Estate of Britenstool v. Commissioner, 46 T.C. 711 (1966), in which the Tax Court held that a reimbursement required by the predecessor of EPTL § 11-1.2(A) resulted in the estate receiving the same charitable contributions deduction it would have received if the administration expenses had been deducted for estate tax purposes instead of for income tax purposes. Because a fiduciary will elect to deduct administration expenses for income tax purposes only when the income tax reduction exceeds the estate tax reduction, the effect of this adjustment is that the principal is placed in the same position it would have occupied if the fiduciary had deducted the expenses for estate tax purposes, but the income beneficiaries receive an additional benefit. For example, if the income tax benefit from the deduction is $30,000 and the estate tax benefit would have been $20,000, principal will be reimbursed $20,000 and the net benefit to the income beneficiaries will be $10,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            Irrevocable grantor trusts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under Sections 671-679 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. §§ 671-679] (the “grantor trust” provisions), a person who creates an irrevocable trust for the benefit of another person may be subject to tax on the trust's income or capital gains, or both, even though the settlor is not entitled to receive any income or principal from the trust. Because this is now a well-known tax result, many trusts have been created to produce this result, but there are also trusts that are unintentionally subject to this rule. The Act does not require or authorize a trustee to distribute funds from the trust to the settlor in these cases because it is difficult to establish a rule that applies only to trusts where this tax result is unintended and does not apply to trusts where the tax result is intended. Settlors who intend this tax result rarely state it as an objective in the terms of the trust, but instead rely on the operation of the tax law to produce the desired result. As a result it may not be possible to determine from the terms of the trust if the result was intentional or unintentional. If the drafter of such a trust wants the trustee to have the authority to distribute principal or income to the settlor to reimburse the settlor for taxes paid on the trust's income or capital gains, such a provision should be placed in the terms of the trust. In some situations the Internal Revenue Service may require that such a provision be placed in the terms of the trust as a condition to issuing a private letter ruling.

      A transfer may be made only for one (1) minor, and up to two (2) persons may be the custodians. All custodial property held under this chapter by the same custodian or custodians for the benefit of the same minor constitutes a single custodianship. If more than one (1) person is appointed a custodian, such persons shall act as joint custodians under this chapter and, unless specified in any document creating the custodial property, each joint custodian shall have full power and authority to act alone with respect to the custodial property. If either joint custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed, then the remaining one (1) of them may serve as sole custodian without the necessity of appointing a successor joint custodian.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the governing instrument or in any other law of this state, the trustee of any charitable remainder trust described in § 1.664-3(a)(1)(i)(b) of the Internal Revenue Code Regulations, (26 CFR 1.664-3(a)(1)(i)(b)), as currently adopted, or as may be subsequently amended, may, without application to any court and either before or after the funding of such trust, reform the trust to meet the definition of a charitable remainder unitrust described in § 1.664-3(a)(1)(i)(c) of the Internal Revenue Code Regulations, (26 CFR 1.664-3(a)(1)(i)(c)), as currently adopted, or as may be subsequently amended. In order to effectuate this reformation, the trustee shall obtain the written consent of all living grantors, living beneficiaries, charitable beneficiaries named or otherwise provided for in the trust agreement, and the trustee, together with the written concurrence of the attorney general and reporter. If the charitable beneficiary is to be determined by a person having discretion to select or name the charitable beneficiary at the time the trust terminates, the consent of that person shall be required. Consent shall not be required as to individual beneficiaries or grantors not living at the time of reformation or as to charitable remainder beneficiaries not named or not in existence at the time of reformation.

In the case of an individual beneficiary or grantor not competent to give consent, the consent of that beneficiary's or grantor's guardian or conservator, if any, or the consent of a guardian ad litem appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be treated as the consent of the beneficiary or grantor. A copy of the proposed reformation, executed by the trustee and consented to by all living grantors, living beneficiaries, and charitable beneficiaries named or otherwise provided for in the trust agreement, shall be delivered to the attorney general and reporter. The attorney general and reporter shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt, either concur with the proposed reformation or state any specific objections to the proposed reformation in writing and delivered to the trustee by registered mail. If the attorney general and reporter state objections and those objections are not resolved to the attorney general's and reporter's satisfaction or the attorney general and reporter does not withdraw the objections, subdivision (b)(3) shall apply.

         In the event that all of the living grantors, living beneficiaries, and charitable remainder beneficiaries do not consent to the reformation, any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the power to reform the governing instrument in accordance with subdivision (b)(1) upon petition by the trustee or any beneficiary. A copy of the petition shall be delivered in person or by registered mail to the attorney general and reporter.

       Prefatory Note
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons for Revision.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) replaces the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (UMIFA).  The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved UMIFA in 1972, and 47 jurisdictions have enacted the act.  UMIFA provided guidance and authority to charitable organizations within its scope concerning the management and investment of funds held by those organizations, UMIFA provided endowment spending rules that did not depend on trust accounting principles of income and principal, and UMIFA permitted the release of restrictions on the use or management of funds under certain circumstances.  The changes UMIFA made to the law permitted charitable organizations to use modern investment techniques such as total-return investing and to determine endowment fund spending based on spending rates rather than on determinations of “income” and “principal.”
      </p>
      <p>
       UMIFA was drafted almost 35 years ago, and portions of it are now out of date.  The prudence standards in UMIFA have provided useful guidance, but prudence norms evolve over time.  The new Act provides modern articulations of the prudence standards for the management and investment of charitable funds and for endowment spending.  The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA), an Act promulgated in 1994 and already enacted in 43 jurisdictions, served as a model for many of the revisions.  UPIA updates rules on investment decision making for trusts, including charitable trusts, and imposes additional duties on trustees for the protection of beneficiaries.  UPMIFA applies these rules and duties to charities organized as nonprofit corporations.  UPMIFA does not apply to trusts managed by corporate and other fiduciaries that are not charities, because UPIA provides management and investment standards for those trusts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In applying principles based on UPIA to charities organized as nonprofit corporations, UPMIFA combines the approaches taken by UPIA and by the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (RMNCA).  UPMIFA reflects the fact that standards for managing and investing institutional funds are and should be the same regardless of whether a charitable organization is organized as a trust, a nonprofit corporation, or some other entity.  See  Bevis Longstreth, Modern Investment Management and the Prudent Man Rule 7 (1986) (stating “[t]he modern paradigm of prudence applies to all fiduciaries who are subject to some version of the prudent man rule, whether under ERISA, the private foundation provisions of the Code, UMIFA, other state statutes, or the common law.”); Harvey P. Dale, Nonprofit Directors and Officers — Duties and Liabilities for Investment Decisions,  1994 N.Y.U. Conf. Tax Plan. 501(c)(3) Org’s. Ch. 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPMIFA provides guidance and authority to charitable organizations concerning the management and investment of funds held by those organizations, and UPMIFA imposes additional duties on those who manage and invest charitable funds.  These duties provide additional protections for charities and also protect the interests of donors who want to see their contributions used wisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPMIFA modernizes the rules governing expenditures from endowment funds, both to provide stricter guidelines on spending from endowment funds and to give institutions the ability to cope more easily with fluctuations in the value of the endowment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, UPMIFA updates the provisions governing the release and modification of restrictions on charitable funds to permit more efficient management of these funds. These provisions derive from the approach taken in the Uniform Trust Code (UTC) for modifying charitable trusts.  Like the UTC provisions, UPMIFA’s modification rules preserve the historic position of the attorneys general in most states as the overseers of charities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As under UMIFA, the new Act applies to charities organized as charitable trusts, as nonprofit corporations, or in some other manner, but the rules do not apply to funds managed by trustees that are not charities.  Thus, the Act does not apply to trusts managed by corporate or individual trustees, but the Act does apply to trusts managed by charities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prudent Management and Investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       UMIFA applied the 1972 prudence standard to investment decision making.  In contrast, UPMIFA will give charities updated and more useful guidance by incorporating language from UPIA, modified to fit the special needs of charities.  The revised Act spells out more of the factors a charity should consider in making investment decisions, thereby imposing a modern, well accepted, prudence standard based on UPIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the expressly enumerated prudence factors in UPMIFA is “the preservation of the endowment fund,” a standard not articulated in UMIFA.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to identifying factors that a charity must consider in making management and investment decisions, UPMIFA requires a charity and those who manage and invest its funds to:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Give primary consideration to donor intent as expressed in a gift instrument,
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Act in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person would exercise,
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Incur only reasonable costs in investing and managing charitable funds,
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Make a reasonable effort to verify relevant facts,
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Make decisions about each asset in the context of the portfolio of investments, as part of an overall investment strategy,
      </p>
      <p>
       6. Diversify investments unless due to special circumstances, the purposes of the fund are better served without diversification,
      </p>
      <p>
       7. Dispose of unsuitable assets, and
      </p>
      <p>
       8. In general, develop an investment strategy appropriate for the fund and the charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       UMIFA did not articulate these requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, UPMIFA strengthens the rules governing management and investment decision making by charities and provides more guidance for those who manage and invest the funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donor Intent with Respect to Endowments.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPMIFA improves the protection of donor intent with respect to expenditures from endowments.   When a donor expresses intent clearly in a written gift instrument, the Act requires that the charity follow the donor’s instructions.  When a donor’s intent is not so expressed, UPMIFA directs the charity to spend an amount that is prudent, consistent with the purposes of the fund, relevant economic factors, and the donor’s intent that the fund continue in perpetuity.  This approach allows the charity to give effect to donor intent, protect its endowment, assure generational equity, and use the endowment to support the purposes for which the endowment was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retroactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like UMIFA, UPIA, the Uniform Principal and Income Act of 1961, and the Uniform Principal and Income Act of 1997, UPMIFA applies retroactively to institutional funds created before and prospectively to institutional funds created after enactment of the statute.  Regarding the considerations motivating this treatment of the issues, see the comment to Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>].
      </p>
      <p>
       Endowment Spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPMIFA improves the endowment spending rule by eliminating the concept of historic dollar value and providing better guidance regarding the operation of the prudence standard.  Under UMIFA a charity can spend amounts above historic dollar value that the charity determines to be prudent.  The Act directs the charity to focus on the purposes and needs of the charity rather than on the purposes and perpetual nature of the fund.  Amounts below historic dollar value cannot be spent.  The Drafting Committee concluded that this endowment spending rule created numerous problems and that restructuring the rule would benefit charities, their donors, and the public.  The problems include:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Historic dollar value fixes valuation at a moment in time, and that moment is arbitrary.  If a donor provides for a gift in the donor’s will, the date of valuation for the gift will likely be the donor’s date of death.  (UMIFA left uncertain what the appropriate date for valuing a testamentary gift was.)  The determination of historic dollar value can vary significantly depending upon when in the market cycle the donor dies.  In addition, the fund may be below historic dollar value at the time the charity receives the gift if the value of the asset declines between the date of the donor’s death and the date the asset is actually distributed to the charity from the estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. After a fund has been in existence for a number of years, historic dollar value may become meaningless.  Assuming reasonable long term investment success, the value of the typical fund will be well above historic dollar value, and historic dollar value will no longer represent the purchasing power of the original gift.  Without better guidance on spending the increase in value of the fund, historic dollar value does not provide adequate protection for the fund.  If a charity views the restriction on spending simply as a direction to preserve historic dollar value, the charity may spend more than it should.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The Act does not provide clear answers to questions a charity faces when the value of an endowment fund drops below historic dollar value.  A fund that is so encumbered is commonly called an “underwater” fund. Conflicting advice regarding whether an organization could spend from an underwater fund has led to difficulties for those managing charities.  If a charity concluded that it could continue to spend trust accounting income until a fund regained its historic dollar value, the charity might invest for income rather than on a total-return basis.  Thus, the historic dollar value rule can cause inappropriate distortions in investment policy and can ultimately lead to a decline in a fund’s real value.  If, instead, a charity with an underwater fund continues to invest for growth, the charity may be unable to spend anything from an underwater endowment fund for several years.  The inability of a charity to spend anything from an endowment is likely to be contrary to donor intent, which is to provide current benefits to the charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Drafting Committee concluded that providing clearly articulated guidance on the prudence rule for spending from an endowment fund, with emphasis on the permanent nature of the fund, would provide the best protection of the purchasing power of endowment funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of Imprudence.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPMIFA includes as an optional provision a presumption of imprudence if a charity spends more than seven percent of an endowment fund in any one year.  The presumption is meant to protect against spending an endowment too quickly.  Although the Drafting Committee believes that the prudence standard of UPMIFA provides appropriate and adequate protection for endowments, the Committee provided the option for states that want to include a mechanical guideline in the statute.  A major drawback to any statutory percentage is that it is unresponsive to changes in the rate of inflation or deflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modification of Restrictions on Charitable Funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPMIFA clarifies that the doctrines of cy pres and deviation apply to funds held by nonprofit corporations as well as to funds held by charitable trusts.  Courts have applied trust law rules to nonprofit corporations in the past, but the Drafting Committee believed that statutory authority for applying these principles to nonprofit corporations would be helpful.  UMIFA permitted release of restrictions but left the application of cy pres uncertain.  Under UPMIFA, as under trust law, the court will determine whether and how to apply cy pres or deviation and the attorney general will receive notice and have the opportunity to participate in the proceeding.  The one addition to existing law is that UPMIFA gives a charity the authority to modify a restriction on a fund that is both old and small.  For these funds, the expense of a trip to court will often be prohibitive.  By permitting a charity to make an appropriate modification, money is saved for the charitable purposes of the charity.  Even with respect to small, old funds, however, the charity must notify the attorney general of the charity’s intended action.  Of course, if the attorney general has concerns, he or she can seek the agreement of the charity to change or abandon the modification, and if that fails, can commence a court action to enjoin it.  Thus, in all types of modification the attorney general continues to be the protector both of the donor’s intent and of the public’s interest in charitable funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other Organizational Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       For matters not governed by UPMIFA, a charitable organization will continue to be governed by rules applicable to charitable trusts, if it is organized as a trust, or rules applicable to nonprofit corporations, if it is organized as a nonprofit corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relation to Trust Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although UPMIFA applies a number of rules from trust law to institutions organized as nonprofit corporations, in two respects UPMIFA creates rules that do not exist under the common law applicable to trusts.  The endowment spending rule of Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] and the provision for modifying a small, old fund in subsection (d) of Section 6 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-206" target="_self">35-10-206</a></cite>] have no counterparts in the common law or the UTC.  The Drafting Committee believes that these rules could be useful to charities organized as trusts, and the Committee recommends conforming amendments to the UTC and the Principal and Income Act to incorporate these changes into trust law.

        </h4>
        <p>
         Subsection (1). Charitable Purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
         The definition of charitable purpose follows that of UTC § 405 and Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 28 (2003). This long-familiar standard derives from the English Statute of Charitable Uses, enacted in 1601.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some 17 states have created statutory definitions of charitable purpose for various purposes.  See, e.g.,  10 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 162.3 (2005) (defining charitable purpose within the Solicitation of Funds for Charitable Purposes Act to include “humane,” “patriotic,” social welfare and advocacy,” and “civic” purposes).  The definition in subsection (1) applies for purposes of this Act and does not affect other definitions of charitable purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (2). Endowment Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         An endowment fund is an institutional fund or a part of an institutional fund that is not wholly expendable by the institution on a current basis. A restriction that makes a fund an endowment fund arises from the terms of a gift instrument.  If an institution has more than one endowment fund, under Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] the institution can manage and invest some or all endowment funds together.  Section 4 and Section 6 [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-206" target="_self">35-10-206</a></cite>] must be applied to individual funds and cannot be applied to a group of funds that may be managed collectively for investment purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Board-designated funds are institutional funds but not endowment funds. The rules on expenditures and modification of restrictions in this Act do not apply to restrictions that an institution places on an otherwise unrestricted fund that the institution holds for its own benefit. The institution may be able to change these restrictions itself, subject to internal rules and to the fiduciary duties that apply to those that manage the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         If an institution transfers assets to another institution, subject to the restriction that the other institution hold the assets as an endowment, then the second institution will hold the assets as an endowment fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (3). Gift Instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
         The term gift instrument refers to the records that establish the terms of a gift and may consist of more than one document.  The definition clarifies that the only legally binding restrictions on a gift are the terms set forth in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
         As used in this definition, “record” is an expansive concept and means a writing in any form, including electronic. The term includes a will, deed, grant, conveyance, agreement, or memorandum, and also includes writings that do not have a donative purpose. For example, under some circumstances the bylaws of the institution, minutes of the board of directors, or canceled checks could be a gift instrument or be one of several records constituting a gift instrument.  Although the term can include any of these records, a record will only become a gift instrument if both the donor and the institution were or should have been aware of its terms when the donor made the gift.  For example, if a donor sends a contribution to an institution for its general purposes, then the articles of incorporation may be used to clarify those purposes.  If, in contrast, the donor sends a letter explaining that the institution should use the contribution for its “educational projects concerning teenage depression,” then any funds received in response must be used for that purpose and not for broader purposes otherwise permissible under the articles of incorporation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Solicitation materials may constitute a gift instrument. For example, a solicitation that suggests in writing that any gifts received pursuant to the solicitation will be held as an endowment may be integrated with other writings and may be considered part of the gift instrument. Whether the terms of the solicitation become part of the gift instrument will depend upon the circumstances, including whether a subsequent writing superseded the terms of the solicitation.  Each gift received in response to a solicitation will be subject to any restrictions indicated in the gift instrument pertaining to that gift.  For example, if an initial gift establishes an endowment fund, and the charity then solicits additional gifts “to be held as part of the Charity X Endowment Fund,” those additional gifts will each be subject to the restriction that the gifts be held as part of that endowment fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         The term gift instrument includes matching funds provided by an employer or some other person.  Whether matching funds are treated as part of the endowment fund or otherwise will depend on the terms of the matching gift.
        </p>
        <p>
         The term gift instrument also includes an appropriation by a legislature or other public or governmental body for the benefit of an institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (4). Institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Act applies generally to institutions organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. The term includes charitable organizations created as nonprofit corporations, unincorporated associations, governmental subdivisions or agencies, or any form of entity, however organized, that is organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes. The term includes a trust organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes, but only if a charity acts as trustee.  This approach leaves unchanged the coverage of UMIFA.  The exclusion of “individual” from the definition of institution is not intended to exclude a corporation sole.

         Although UPMIFA does not apply to all charitable trusts, many of UPMIFA’s provisions derive from trust law.  Prudent investor standards apply to trustees of charitable trusts in states that have adopted UPIA.  Trustees of charitable trusts can use the doctrines of cy pres and deviation to modify trust provisions, and the UTC includes a number of modification provisions.  The Uniform Principal and Income Act permits allocation between principal and income to facilitate total-return investing.  Charitable trusts not included in UPMIFA, primarily those managed by corporate trustees and individuals, will lose the benefits of UPMIFA’s endowment spending rule and the provision permitting a charity to apply cy pres, without court supervision, for modifications to a small, old fund.  Enacting jurisdictions may choose to incorporate these rules into existing trust statutes to provide the benefits to charitable funds managed by corporate trustees.
        </p>
        <p>
         The definition of institution includes governmental organizations that hold funds exclusively for the purposes listed in the definition. A governmental entity created by state law  may fall outside the definition on account of the form of organization under which the state created it. Because state arrangements are so varied, creating a definition that encompasses all charitable entities created by states is not feasible. States should consider applying the core principles of UPMIFA to such governmental institutions. For example, the control over a state university may be held by a State Board of Regents. In that situation, the state may have created a governing structure by statute or in the state constitution so that the university is, in effect, privately chartered. The Drafting Committee does not intend to exclude these universities from the definition of institution, but additional state legislation may be necessary to address particular situations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (5). Institutional Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         The term institutional fund includes any fund held by an institution for charitable purposes, whether the fund is expendable currently or subject to restrictions. The term does not include a fund held by a trustee that is not an institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some institutions combine assets from multiple funds for investment purposes, and some institutions invest funds from different institutions in a common fund.  Typically each fund is assigned units representing the share value of the individual fund.  The assets are invested collectively, permitting more efficient investment and improved diversification of the overall portfolio.  The collective fund makes annual distributions to the individual funds based on the units held by each fund.  For purposes of Section 3 [and Section 5] [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>], the collective fund is considered one institutional fund.  Section 4 and Section 6 [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-206" target="_self">35-10-206</a></cite>] apply to each fund individually and not to the collective fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assets held by an institution primarily for program-related purposes rather than exclusively for investment are not subject to UPMIFA.  For example, a university may purchase land adjacent to its campus for future development.  The purchase might not meet prudent investor standards for commercial real estate, but the purchase may be appropriate because the university needs to build a new dormitory.  The classroom buildings, administration buildings, and dormitories held by the university all have value as property, but the university does not hold those buildings as financial assets for investment purposes.  The Act excludes from the prudent investor norms those assets that a charity uses to conduct its charitable activities, but does not exclude assets that have a tangential tie to the charitable purpose of the institution but are held primarily for investment purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         A fund held by an institution is not an institutional fund if any beneficiary of the fund is not an institution. For example, a charitable remainder trust held by a charity as trustee for the benefit of the donor during the donor’s lifetime, with the remainder interest held by the charity, is not an institutional fund. However, this subsection treats as an institution a charitable remainder trust that continues to operate for charitable purposes after the termination of the noncharitable interests. The Act will have only a limited effect on a charitable remainder trust that terminates after the noncharitable interest ends.  During the period required to complete the distribution of the trust’s property, the prudence norm will apply to the actions of the trustee, but the short timeframe will affect investment decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (6). Person.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Act uses as the definition of person the definition approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.  The definition of institution uses the term person, but to be an institution a person must be organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes.  A person with a commercial purpose cannot be an institution.  Thus, although the definition of person includes “business trust” and “any other . . . commercial entity,” the Act does not apply to an entity organized for business purposes and not exclusively for charitable purposes. Further, the definition of person includes trusts, but only trusts managed by charities can be institutional funds.  UPMIFA does not apply to trusts managed by corporate trustees or by individual trustees.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a governing instrument provides that a fund will revert to the donor if, and only if, the institution ceases to exist or the purposes of the fund fail, then the fund will be considered an institutional fund until such contingency occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (7). Program-Related Asset.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although UPMIFA does not apply to program-related assets, if program-related assets serve, in part, as investments for an institution, then the institution should identify categories for reporting those investments and should establish investment criteria for the investments that are reasonably related to achieving the institution’s charitable purposes.  For example, a program providing below-market loans to inner-city businesses may be “primarily to accomplish a charitable purpose of the institution” but also can be considered, in part, an investment.  The institution should create reasonable credit standards and other guidelines for the program to increase the likelihood that the loans will be repaid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (8). Record.
        </p>
        <p>
         This definition was added to clarify that the definition of instrument includes electronic records as defined in Section 2(8) of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (1999) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c10s47-10-102ol17" target="_blank">47-10-102(7)</a></cite>].

         Purpose and Scope of Revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         This section adopts the prudence standard for investment decision making. The section directs directors or others responsible for managing and investing the funds of an institution to act as a prudent investor would, using a portfolio approach in making investments and considering the risk and return objectives of the fund. The section lists the factors that commonly bear on decisions in fiduciary investing and incorporates the duty to diversify investments absent a conclusion that special circumstances make a decision not to diversify reasonable. Thus, the section follows modern portfolio theory for investment decision making. Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] applies to all funds held by an institution, regardless of whether the institution obtained the funds by gift or otherwise and regardless of whether the funds are restricted.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Drafting Committee discussed extensively the standard that should govern nonprofit managers. UMIFA states the standard as “ordinary business care and prudence under the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of the action or decision.” Since the decision in Stern v. Lucy Webb Hayes National Training School for Deaconesses, 381 F. Supp. 1003 (1974), the trend has been to hold directors of nonprofit corporations to a standard nominally similar to the corporate standard but with the recognition that the facts and circumstances considered include the fact that the entity is a charity and not a business corporation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The language of the prudence standard adopted in UPMIFA is derived from the RMNCA and from the prudent investor rule of UPIA. The standard is consistent with the business judgment standard under corporate law, as applied to charitable institutions. That is, a manager operating a charitable organization under the business judgment rule would look to the same factors as those identified by the prudent investor rule. The standard for prudent investment set forth in Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] first states the duty of care as articulated in the RMNCA, but provides more specific guidance for those managing and investing institutional funds by incorporating language from UPIA.  The criteria derived from UPIA are consistent with good practice under current law applicable to nonprofit corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trust law norms already inform managers of nonprofit corporations.  The Preamble to UPIA explains:  “Although the Uniform Prudent Investor Act by its terms applies to trusts and not to charitable corporations, the standards of the Act can be expected to inform the investment responsibilities of directors and officers of charitable corporations.”  See also, Restatement (Third) of Trusts:  Prudent Investor Rule § 379, Comment b, at 190 (1992) (stating that “absent a contrary statute or other provision, the prudent investor rule applies to investment of funds held for charitable corporations.”).  Trust precedents have routinely been found to be helpful but not binding authority in corporate cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Drafting Committee decided that by adopting language from both the RMNCA and UPIA, UPMIFA could clarify that common standards of prudent investing apply to all charitable institutions.  Although the principal trust authorities, UPIA § (2)(a), Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 337, UTC § 804, and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174 (prudent administration) use the phrase “care, skill and caution,” the Drafting Committee decided to use the more familiar corporate formulation as found in RMNCA.  The standard also appears in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of UPMIFA [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite> - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>].  The Drafting Committee does not intend any substantive change to the UPIA standard and believes that “reasonable care, skill, and caution” are implicit in the term “care” as used in the RMNCA.  The Drafting Committee included the detailed provisions from UPIA, because the Committee believed that the greater precision of the prudence norms of the Restatement and UPIA, as compared with UMIFA, could helpfully inform managers of charitable institutions.  For an explanation of the Prudent Investor Act, see  John H. Langbein, The Uniform Prudent Investor Act and the Future of Trust Investing , 81 Iowa L. Rev. 641 (1996), and for a discussion of the effect UPIA has had on investment decision making, see  Max M. Schanzenbach &amp; Robert H. Sitkoff, Did Reform of Prudent Trust Investment Laws Change Trust Portfolio Allocation? , 50 J. L. &amp; Econ. (forthcoming 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] has incorporated the provisions of UPIA with only a few exceptions.  UPIA applies to private trusts and is entirely default law.  The settlor of a private trust has complete control over virtually all trust provisions.  See UTC § 105.  Because UPMIFA applies to charitable organizations, UPMIFA  makes the duty of care, the duty to minimize costs, and the duty to investigate mandatory.  The duty of loyalty is mandatory under applicable organization law, corporate or trust.  Other than these duties, the provisions of Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] are default rules. A gift instrument or the governing instruments of an institution can modify these duties, but the charitable purpose doctrine limits the extent to which an institution or a donor can restrict these duties.  In addition, subsection (a) of Section 3 [§ 35-10-203] reminds the decision maker that the intent of a donor expressed in a gift instrument will control decision making.  Further, the decision maker must consider the charitable purposes of the institution and the purposes of the institutional fund for which decisions are being made.  These factors are specific to charitable organizations; UPIA § 2(a) states the duty to consider similar factors in the private trust context.
        </p>
        <p>
         UPMIFA does not include the duty of impartiality, stated in UPIA § 6, because nonprofit corporations do not confront the multiple beneficiaries problem to which the duty is addressed.  Under UPIA, a trustee must treat the current beneficiaries and the remainder beneficiaries with due regard to their respective interests, subject to alternative direction from the trust document.  A nonprofit corporation typically creates one charity.  The institution may serve multiple beneficiaries, but those beneficiaries do not have enforceable rights in the institution in the same way that beneficiaries of a private trust do.  Of course, if a charitable trust is created to benefit more than one charity, rather than being created to carry out a charitable purpose, then UPIA will apply the duty of impartiality to that trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         In other respects, the Drafting Committee made changes to language from UPIA only where necessary to adapt the language for charitable institutions.  No material differences are intended.  Subsection (e)(1)(D) of Section 3 of UPMIFA [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] does not include a clause that appears at the end of UPIA § 2(c)(4) (“which may include financial assets, interest in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, and real property.”).  The Drafting Committee deemed this clause unnecessary for charitable institutions.  The language of subsection (e)(1)(G) reflects a modification of the language of UPIA § (2)(c)(7).  Other minor modifications to the UPIA provisions make the language more appropriate for charitable institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The duties imposed by this section apply to those who govern an institution, including directors and trustees, and to those to whom the directors or managers delegate responsibility for investment and management of institutional funds.  The standard applies to officers and employees of an institution and to agents who invest and manage institutional funds. Volunteers who work with an institution will be subject to the duties imposed here, but state and federal statutes may provide reduced liability for persons who act without compensation.  UPMIFA does not affect the application of those shield statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a). Donor Intent and Charitable Purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a) states the overarching duty to comply with donor intent as expressed in the terms of the gift instrument.  The emphasis in the Act on giving effect to donor intent does not mean that the donor can or should control the management of the institution.  The other fundamental duty is the duty to consider the charitable purposes of the institution and of the institutional fund in making management and investment decisions.  UPIA § 2(a) states a similar duty to consider the purposes of a trust in investing and managing assets of a trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b).  Duty of Loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b) reminds those managing and investing institutional funds that the duty of loyalty will apply to their actions, but Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] does not state the loyalty standard that applies.  The Drafting Committee was concerned, at least nominally, that different standards of loyalty may apply to directors of nonprofit corporations and to trustees of charitable trusts.  The RMNCA provides that under the duty of loyalty a director of a nonprofit corporation should act “in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.”  RMNCA § 8.30.  The trust law articulation of the loyalty standard uses “sole interests” rather than “best interests.”  As the Restatement of Trusts explains, “[t]he trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiary.”  Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170 (1).  Although the standards for loyalty, like the standard of care, are merging, see  Evelyn Brody, Charitable Governance:  What’s Trust Law Got to do With It?  Chi.-Kent L. Rev. (2005); John H. Langbein, Questioning the Trust Law Duty of Loyalty: Sole Interest or Best Interest , 114 Yale L.J. 929 (2005), the Drafting Committee concluded that formulating a duty of loyalty provision for UPMIFA was unnecessary.  Thus the duty of loyalty under nonprofit corporation law will apply to charities organized as nonprofit corporations, and the duty of loyalty under trust law will apply to charitable trusts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b). Duty of Care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b) also applies the duty of care to performance of investment duties. The language derives from § 8.30 of the RMNCA.  This subsection states the duty to act in good faith, “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.”  Although the language in the RMNCA and in UPMIFA is similar to that of § 8.30 of the Model Business Corporation Act (3d ed. 2002), the standard as applied to persons making decisions for charities is informed by the fact that the institution is a charity and not a business corporation.  Thus, in UPMIFA the references to “like position” and “similar circumstances” mean that the charitable nature of the institution affects the decision making of a prudent person acting under the standard set forth in subsection (b).  The duty of care involves considering the factors set forth in subsection (e)(1).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c)(1). Duty to Minimize Costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c)(1) tracks the language of UPIA § 7 and requires an institution to minimize costs. An institution may prudently incur costs by hiring an investment advisor, but the costs incurred should be appropriate under the circumstances. See UPIA § 7 cmt; Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, cmt. M, at 58 (1992); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 188 (1959). The duty is consistent with the duty to act prudently under § 8.30 of the RMNCA.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c)(2). Duty to Investigate.
        </p>
        <p>
         This subsection incorporates the traditional fiduciary duty to investigate, using language from UPIA § 2(d). The subsection requires persons who make investment and management decisions to investigate the accuracy of the information used in making decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d). Pooling Funds.
        </p>
        <p>
         An institution holding more than one institutional fund may find that pooling its funds for investment and management purposes will be economically beneficial.  The Act permits pooling for these purposes.  The prohibition against commingling no longer prevents pooling funds for investment and management purposes.  See UPIA § 3, cmt. (duty to diversify aided by pooling); UPIA § 7, cmt. (pooling to minimize costs); Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Duty to Segregate and Identify Trust Property § 84 (T.D. No. 4 2005).  Funds will be considered individually for other purposes of the Act, including for the spending rule for endowment funds of Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] and the modification rules of Section 6 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-206" target="_self">35-10-206</a></cite>].
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(1). Prudent Decision Making.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(1) takes much of its language from UPIA § 2(c). In making decisions about whether to acquire or retain an asset, the institution should consider the institution’s mission, its current programs, and the desire to cultivate additional donations from a donor, in addition to factors related more directly to the asset’s potential as an investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(1)(C) reflects the fact that some organizations will invest in taxable investments that may generate unrelated business taxable income for income tax purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assets held primarily for program-related purposes are not subject to UPMIFA. The management of those assets will continue to be governed by other laws applicable to the institution. Other assets may not be held primarily for program-related purposes but may have both investment purposes and program-related purposes. Subsections (a) and (e)(1)(H) indicate that a prudent decision maker can take into consideration the relationship between an investment and the purposes of the institution and of the institutional fund in making an investment that may have a program-related purpose but not be primarily program-related. The degree to which an institution uses an asset to accomplish a charitable purpose will affect the weight given that factor in a decision to acquire or retain the asset.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(2). Portfolio Approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         This subsection reflects the use of portfolio theory in modern investment practice. The language comes from UPIA § 2(b), which follows the articulation of the prudent investor standard in Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227(a) (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(3). Broad Investment Authority.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consistent with the portfolio theory of investment, this subsection permits a broad range of investments.  The language derives from UPIA § 2(e).
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 4 of UMIFA indicated that an institution could invest “without restriction to investments a fiduciary may make.”  The committee removed this language from subsection (e)(3) as unnecessary, because states no longer have legal lists restricting fiduciary investing to the specific types of investments identified in statutory lists.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(3) also provides that other law may limit the authority under this subsection.  In addition, all of subsection (e) is subject to contrary provisions in a gift instrument, and a gift instrument may restrict the ability to invest in particular assets.  For example, the gift instrument for a particular institutional fund might preclude the institution from investing the assets of the fund in companies that produce tobacco products.
        </p>
        <p>
         In her book, Governing Nonprofit Organizations: Federal and State Law and Regulation 434 (Harv. Univ. Press 2004), Marion R. Fremont-Smith reports that some large charities pledge their endowment funds as security for loans.  Subsection (e)(3) permits this sort of debt financing, subject to the guidelines of subsection (e)(1).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(4). Duty to Diversify.
        </p>
        <p>
         This subsection assumes that prudence requires diversification but permits an institution to determine that nondiversification is appropriate under exceptional circumstances.  A decision not to diversify must be based on the needs of the charity and not solely for the benefit of a donor.  A decision to retain property in the hope of obtaining additional contributions from the same donor may be considered made for the benefit of the charity, but the appropriateness of that decision will depend on the circumstances.  This subsection derives its language from UPIA § 3. See  UPIA § 3 cmt. (discussing the rationale for diversification); Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(5). Disposing of Unsuitable Assets.
        </p>
        <p>
         This subsection imposes a duty on an institution to review the suitability of retaining property contributed to the institution within a reasonable period of time after the institution receives the property.  Subsection (e)(5) requires the institution to make a decision but does not require a particular outcome.  The institution may consider a variety of factors in making its decision, and a decision to retain the property either for a period of time or indefinitely may be a prudent decision.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 4(2) of UMIFA specifically authorized an institution to retain property contributed by a donor.  The comment explained that an institution might retain property in the hope of obtaining additional contributions from the donor.  Under UPMIFA the potential for developing additional contributions by retaining property contributed to the institution would be among the “other circumstances” that the institution might consider in deciding whether to retain or dispose of the property.  The institution must weigh the potential for obtaining additional contributions with all other factors that affect the suitability of retaining the property in the investment portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
         The language of subsection (e)(5) comes from UPIA § 4, which restates Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 229 (1992), which adopted language from Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 231 (1959). See  UPIA § 4 cmt.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(6). Special Skills or Expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e)(6) states the rule provided in UPIA § 2(f) requiring a trustee to use the trustee’s own skills and expertise in carrying out the trustee’s fiduciary duties. The comment to RMNCA § 8.30 describes the existence of a similar rule under the law of nonprofit corporations.  Section 8.30(a)(2) provides that in discharging duties a director must act “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. . . .”  The comment explains that”[t]he concept of ‘under similar circumstances’ relates not only to the circumstances of the corporation but to the special background, qualifications, and management experience of the individual director and the role the director plays in the corporation.”  After describing directors chosen for their ability to raise money, the comment notes that “[n]o special skill or expertise should be expected from such directors unless their background or knowledge evidences some special ability.”
        </p>
        <p>
         The intent of subsection (e)(6) is that a person managing or investing institutional funds must use the person’s own judgment and experience, including any particular skills or expertise, in carrying out the management or investment duties.  For example, if a charity names a person as a director in part because the person is a lawyer, the lawyer’s background may allow the lawyer to recognize legal issues in connection with funds held by the charity.  The lawyer should identify the issues for the board, but the lawyer is not expected to provide legal advice.  A lawyer is not expected to be able to recognize every legal issue, particularly issues outside the lawyer’s area of expertise, simply because the board member is lawyer.  See  ALI Principles of the Law of Nonprofit Organizations, Preliminary Draft No. 3 (May 12, 2005) § 315 (Duty of Care), cmt. c.
        </p>
        <p>
         UMIFA contained two provisions that authorized investments in pooled or common investment funds. UMIFA §§ 4(3), 4(4). The Drafting Committee concluded that Section 3(e)(3) of UPMIFA [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203ol1e3" target="_self">35-10-203(e)(3)</a></cite>] authorizes these investments. The decision not to include the two provisions in UPMIFA implies no disapproval of such investments.

        <p>
         Purpose and Scope of Revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         This section revises the provision in UMIFA that permitted the expenditure of appreciation of an endowment fund to the extent the fund had appreciated in value above the fund’s historic dollar value. UMIFA defined historic dollar value to mean all contributions to the fund, valued at the time of contribution. Instead of using historic dollar value as a limitation, UPMIFA applies a more carefully articulated prudence standard to the process of making decisions about expenditures from an endowment fund.  The expenditure rule of Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] applies only to the extent that a donor and an institution have not reached some other agreement about spending from an endowment.  If a gift instrument sets forth specific requirements for spending, then the charity must comply with those requirements.  However, if the gift instrument uses more general language, for example directing the charity to “hold the fund as an endowment” or “retain principal and spend income,” then Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] provides a rule of construction to guide the charity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the promulgation of UMIFA, “income” for trust accounting purposes meant interest and dividends but not capital gains, whether or not realized.  Many institutions assumed that trust accounting principles applied to charities organized as nonprofit corporations, and the rules limited the institutions’ ability to invest their endowment funds effectively.  UMIFA addressed this problem by construing “income” in gift instruments to include a prudent amount of capital gains, both realized and unrealized.  Under UMIFA an institution could spend appreciation in addition to spending income determined under trust accounting rules.  This rule of construction likely carried out the intent of the donor better than a rule limiting spending to trust accounting income, while permitting the charity to invest in a manner that could generate better returns for the fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         UPMIFA also applies a rule of construction to terms like “income” or “endowment.”  The assumption in the Act is that a donor who uses one of these terms intends to create a fund that will generate sufficient gains to be able to make ongoing distributions from the fund while at the same time preserving the purchasing power of the fund.  Because historic dollar value under UMIFA was a number fixed in time, the use of that approach may not have adequately captured the intent of a donor who wanted the endowment fund to continue to maintain its value in current dollars.  UPMIFA takes a different approach, directing the institution to determine spending based on the total assets of the endowment fund rather than determining spending by adding a prudent amount of appreciation to trust accounting income.
        </p>
        <p>
         UPMIFA requires the persons making spending decisions for an endowment fund to focus on the purposes of the endowment fund as opposed to the purposes of the institution more generally, as was the case under UMIFA.  When the institution considers the purposes and duration of the fund, the institution will give priority to the donor’s general intent that the fund be maintained permanently.  Although the Act does not require that a specific amount be set aside as “principal,” the Act assumes that the charity will act to preserve “principal” (i.e., to maintain the purchasing power of the amounts contributed to the fund) while spending “income” (i.e. making a distribution each year that represents a reasonable spending rate, given investment performance and general economic conditions).  Thus, an institution should monitor principal in an accounting sense, identifying the original value of the fund (the historic dollar value) and the increases in value necessary to maintain the purchasing power of the fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a).  Expenditure of Endowment Funds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a) uses the RMNCA articulation of the standard of care for decision making under Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>].  The change in language does not reflect a substantive change.  The comment to Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203" target="_self">35-10-203</a></cite>] more fully describes that standard of care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] permits expenditures from an endowment fund to the extent the institution determines that the expenditures are prudent after considering the factors listed in subsection (a).  These factors emphasize the importance of the intent of the donor, as expressed in a gift instrument.  Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] looks to written documents as evidence of donor’s intent and does not require an institution to rely on oral expressions of intent.  By requiring written evidence of intent, the Act protects reliance by the donor and the institution on the written terms of a donative agreement. Informal conversations may be misremembered and may be subject to multiple interpretations.  Of course, oral expressions of intent may guide an institution in further carrying out a donor’s wishes and in understanding a donor’s intent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The factors in subsection (a) require attention to the purposes of the institution and the endowment fund, economic conditions, and present and reasonably anticipated resources of the institution. As under UMIFA, determinations under Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] do not depend on the characterization of assets as income or principal and are not limited to the amount of income and unrealized appreciation.  The authority in Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] is permissive, however, and an institution organized as a trust may continue to make spending decisions under trust accounting principles so long as doing so is prudent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Institutions have operated effectively under UMIFA and have operated more conservatively than the historic dollar value rule would have permitted. Institutions have little incentive to maximize allowable spending.  Good practice has been to provide for modest expenditures while maintaining the purchasing power of a fund. Institutions have followed this practice even though UMIFA (1) does not require an institution to maintain a fund’s purchasing power and (2) does allow an institution to spend any amounts in a fund above historic dollar value, subject to the prudence standard.  The Drafting Committee concluded that eliminating historic dollar value and providing institutions with more discretion would not lead to depletion of endowment funds. Instead, UPMIFA should encourage institutions to establish a spending policy that will be responsive to short-term fluctuations in the value of the fund. Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] allows an institution to maintain appropriate levels of expenditures in times of economic downturn or economic strength. In some years, accumulation rather than spending will be prudent, and in other years an institution may appropriately make expenditures even if a fund has not generated investment return that year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several levels of safeguard exist to prevent an institution from depleting an endowment fund or diverting assets from the purposes for which the fund was created.  In comparison with UMIFA, UPMIFA provides greater direction to the institution with respect to making a prudent determination about spending from an endowment. UMIFA told the decision maker to consider “long and short term needs of the institution in carrying out its educational, religious, charitable, or other eleemosynary purposes, its present and anticipated financial requirements, expected total return on its investments, price level trends, and general economic conditions.”  UPMIFA clarifies that in making spending decisions the institution should attempt to ensure that the value of the fund endures while still providing that some amounts be spent for the purposes of the endowment fund.  In UPMIFA prudent decision making emphasizes the endowment aspect of the fund, rather than the overall purposes or needs of the institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the guidance provided by Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>], other safeguards exist.  Donors can restrict gifts and can provide specific instructions to donee institutions regarding appropriate uses for assets contributed. Within institutions, fiduciary duties govern the persons making decisions on expenditures. Those persons must operate both with the best interests of the institution in mind and in keeping with the intent of donors. If an institution diverts an institutional fund from the charitable purposes of the institution, the state attorney general can enforce the charitable interests of the public. By relying on these safeguards while providing institutions with adequate discretion to make appropriate expenditures, the Act creates a standard that takes into consideration the diversity of the charitable sector. The committee expects that accumulated experience with such spending formulas will continue to inform institutional practice under the Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         Distinguishing Legal and Accounting Standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deleting historic dollar value does not transform any portion of an endowment fund into unrestricted assets from a legal standpoint.  An endowment fund is restricted because of the donor’s intent that the fund be restricted by the prudent spending rule, that the fund not be spent in the current year, and that the fund continue to maintain its value for a long time.  Regardless of the treatment of endowment fund from an accounting standpoint, legally an endowment fund should not be considered unrestricted.  Subsection (a) states that endowment funds will be legally restricted until the institution appropriates funds for expenditure.  The UMIFA statutes in Utah and Maine contain similar language. 13 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 13 § 4106 (West 2005); Utah Code Ann. 1953 § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.13.html#t13c29s13-29-3ol12005" target="_blank">13-29-3 (2005)</a></cite>.   See, also,  advisory published by Mass. Attorney General, “The Attorney General's Position on FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 117, ¶ 22 and Related G.L.C. 180A Issues” (January 2004) http://www.ago.state.ma.us/filelibrary/fasb.pdf (last visited May 22, 2006) (concerning the treatment of endowments as legally restricted assets).
        </p>
        <p>
         The term “endowment fund” includes funds that may last in perpetuity but also funds that are created to last for a fixed term of years or until the institution achieves a specified objective. Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] requires the institution to consider the intended duration of the fund in making determinations about spending. For example, if a donor directs that a fund be spent over 20 years, Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] will guide the institution in making distribution decisions. The institution would amortize the fund over 20 years rather than try to maintain the fund in perpetuity.  For an endowment fund of limited duration, spending at a rate higher than rates typically used for endowment spending will be both necessary and prudent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c).  Rule of Construction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Donor’s intent must be respected in the process of making decisions to expend endowment funds. Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] does not allow an institution to convert an endowment fund into a non-endowment fund nor does the section allow the institution to ignore a donor’s intent that a fund be maintained as an endowment. Rather, subsection (c) provides rules of construction to assist institutions in interpreting donor’s intent. Subsection (c) assumes that if a donor wants an institution to spend “only the income” from a fund, the donor intends that the fund both support current expenditures and be preserved permanently.  The donor is unlikely to be concerned about designation of particular returns as “income” or “principal” under accounting principles. Rather the donor is more likely to assume that the institution will use modern total-return investing techniques to generate enough funds to distribute while maintaining the long-term viability of the fund. Subsection (c) is an intent effectuating provision that provides default rules to construe donor’s intent.
        </p>
        <p>
         As subsection (b) explains, a donor who wants to specify particular spending guidelines can do so.  For example, a donor might require that a charity spend between three and five percent of an endowed gift each year, regardless of investment performance or other factors.  Because the charity agrees to the restriction in accepting the gift, the restriction will govern spending decisions by the charity.  Another donor might want to limit expenditures to trust accounting income and not want the institution to be able to expend appreciation.  An instruction to “pay only the income” will not be specific enough, but an instruction to “pay only interest and dividend income earned by the fund and not to make other distributions of the kind authorized by Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] of UPMIFA” should be sufficient.  If a donor indicates that the rules on investing or expenditures under Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] do not apply to a particular fund, then as a practical matter the institution will probably invest the fund separately. Thus, a decision by a donor to require fund specific expenditure rules will likely also have consequences in the way the institution invests the fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Retroactive Application of the Rule of Construction.
        </p>
        <p>
         A constructional rule resolves an ambiguity, in this case, because donors use words like endowment or income without specific directions regarding the intended meaning.  Changing a statutory constructional rule does not change the underlying intent, and instead changes the way an ambiguity is resolved, in an attempt to increase the likelihood of giving effect to the intent of most donors.

        <p>
         If a donor has stated in a gift instrument specific directions as to spending, then the institution must respect those wishes, but many donors do not give precise instructions about how to spend endowment funds.  In Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] UPMIFA provides guidance for giving effect to a donor’s intent when the donor has not been specific. Like Section 3 of UMIFA, Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] of UPMIFA is a rule of construction, so it does not violate either donor intent or the Constitution.
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue of whether to apply a rule of construction retroactively was considered in connection with UMIFA.  When the New Hampshire legislature considered UMIFA, the Senate asked the New Hampshire Supreme Court for an opinion regarding whether UMIFA, if adopted, would violate a provision of the state constitution prohibiting retrospective laws, and also whether the statute would encroach on the functions of the judicial branch.  The opinion answered no to both questions.  Opinion of the Justices, Request of the Senate No. 6667, 113 N.H. 287, 306 A.2d 55 (1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         More recently the Colorado Supreme Court considered the retroactive application of another constructional statute, one that deems the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy to be revoked in a case in which the marriage was dissolved after the naming of the spouse as beneficiary.  In re Estate of DeWitt, 54 P. 3d 849 (Colo. 2002). In holding that retroactive application of the statute did not violate the Contracts Clause, the court cited approvingly from a statement prepared by the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trusts and Estates Acts (JEB). JEB Statement Regarding the Constitutionality of Changes in Default Rules as Applied to PreExisting Documents, 17 Am. Coll. Tr. & Est. Couns. Notes 184 app. II (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         The JEB Statement explains that the purpose of the anti-retroactivity norm is to protect a transferor who relies on existing rules of law.  By definition, however, rules of construction apply only in situations in which a transferor did not spell out his or her intent and hence did not rely on the then-current rule of construction.   See also In re Gardner's Trust, 266 Minn. 127, 132, 123 N.W. 2d 69, 73 (1963) (“[I]t is doubtful whether the testatrix had any clear intention in mind at the time the will was executed.  It is equally plausible that if she had thought about it at all she would have desired to have the dividends go where the law required them to go at the time they were received by the trustee.”) (Uniform Principal and Income Act).
        </p>
        <p>
         Non-retroactivity would produce serious practical problems:  If the Act were not retroactive, a charity would need to keep two sets of books for each endowment fund created before the enactment of UPMIFA, if new funds were added after the enactment.  The burden that such a rule would impose is out of proportion to the benefit sought.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d).  Rebuttable Presumption of Imprudence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Drafting Committee debated at length whether to include a presumption of imprudence for spending above a fixed percentage of the value of the fund.  The Drafting Committee decided to include a presumption in the Act in brackets, as an option for states to consider, and to include in these Comments a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of including a presumption in the Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some who commented on the Act viewed the presumption as linked to the retroactive application of the rule of construction of subsection (c).  A donor who contributed to an endowment fund under UMIFA may have assumed that the historic dollar value of the gift would be subject to a no-spending rule under the statute.  Because UPMIFA removes the concept of historic dollar value, the bracketed presumption of imprudence would assure the donor that spending from an endowment fund will be so limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those in favor of the presumption of imprudence argued that the presumption would curb the temptation that a charity might have to spend endowment assets too rapidly.  Although the presumption would be rebuttable, and spending above the identified percentage might, in some years and for some charities, be prudent, institutions would likely be reluctant to authorize spending above seven percent.  In addition, the presumption would give the attorney general a benchmark of sorts.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of considerations cut against including a presumption of imprudence in the statute.  A fixed percentage in the statute might be perceived as a safe harbor that could lead institutions to spend more than is prudent.  Although the provision should not be read to imply that spending below seven percent will be considered prudent, some charities might interpret the statute in that way.  Decision makers might be pressured to spend up to the percentage, and in doing so spend more than is prudent, without adequate review of the prudence factors as required under the Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps the biggest problem with including a presumption in the statute is the difficulty of picking a number that will be appropriate in view of the range of institutions and charitable purposes and the fact that economic conditions will change over time.  Under recent economic conditions, a spending rate of seven percent is too high for most funds, but in a period of high inflation, seven percent might be too low.  In making a prudent decision regarding how much to spend from an endowment fund, each institution must consider a variety of factors, including the particular purposes of the fund, the wishes of the donors, changing economic factors, and whether the fund will receive future donations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether or not a statute includes the presumption, institutions must remember that prudence controls decision making. Each institution must make decisions on expenditures based on the circumstances of the particular charity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Application of Presumption.
        </p>
        <p>
         For a state wishing to adopt a presumption of imprudence, subsection (d) provides language.  Under subsection (d), a rebuttable presumption of imprudence will arise if expenditures in one year exceed seven percent of the assets of an endowment fund.  The subsection applies a rolling average of three or more years in determining the value of the fund for purposes of calculating the seven-percent amount.  An institution can rebut the presumption of imprudence if circumstances in a particular year make expenditures above that amount prudent.  The concept and the language for the presumption of imprudence comes from Mass. Gen. L. ch. 180A, § 2 (2004).  Massachusetts enacted this rule in 1975 as part of its UMIFA statute.  New Mexico adopted the same presumption in 1978. N.M.S.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.46.html#t46c09s46-9-2ol1C" target="_blank">46-9-2 (C)</a></cite> (2004).  New Hampshire has a similar provision.  N.H. Rev. Stat. § 292-B:6.
        </p>
        <p>
         The period that a charity uses to calculate the presumption (three or more years) and the frequency of valuation (at least quarterly) will be binding in any determination of whether the presumption applies.  For example, if a charity values an endowment fund on a quarterly basis and averages the quarterly values over three years to determine the fair market value of the fund for purposes calculating seven percent of the fund, the charity’s choices of three years as a smoothing period and quarterly as a valuation period cannot be challenged.  If the charity makes an appropriation that is less than seven percent of this value, then the presumption of imprudence does not arise even if the appropriation would exceed seven percent of the value of the fund calculated based on monthly valuations averaged over five years.
        </p>
        <p>
         If sufficient evidence establishes, by the preponderance of the evidence, the facts necessary to raise the presumption of imprudence, then the institution will have to carry the burden of production of (i.e., the burden of going forward with) other evidence that would tend to demonstrate that its decision was prudent.  The existence of the presumption does not shift the burden of persuasion to the charity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expenditures from an endowment fund may include distributions for charitable purposes and amounts used for the management and administration of the fund, including annual charges for fundraising. The value of a fund, as calculated for purposes of determining the seven percent amount, will reflect increases due to contributions and investment gains and decreases due to distributions and investment losses.  The seven percent figure includes charges for fundraising and administrative expenses other than investment management expenses.  All costs or fees associated with an endowment fund are factors that prudent decision makers consider.  High costs or fees of investment management could be considered imprudent regardless of whether spending exceeds seven percent of the fund’s value.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presumption of imprudence does not create an automatic safe harbor. Expenditures at six percent might well be imprudently high.  See  James P. Garland, The Fecundity of Endowments and Long-Duration Trusts , The Journal of Portfolio Management (2005). Evidence reviewed by the Drafting Committee suggests that at present few funds can sustain spending at a rate above five percent.  See  Roger G. Ibbotson & Rex A. Sinquefield, Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation: Historical Returns (1926-1987) (Research Foundation of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts, 1989).  Indeed, under current conditions five percent can be too high.  See  Joel C. Dobris, Why Five? The Strange, Magnetic, and Mesmerizing Affect of the Five Percent Unitrust and Spending Rate on Settlors, Their Advisers, and Retirees , 40 Real Prop. Prob. & Tr. J. 39 (2005).  Further, spending at a lower rate, particularly in the early years of an endowment, may result in greater distributions over time.  See  DeMarche Associates, Inc, Spending Policies and Investment Planning for Foundations: A Structure for Determining a Foundation’s Asset Mix (Council on Foundations: 3d ed. 1999).  A presumption of imprudence can serve as a reminder that spending at too high a rate will jeopardize the long-term nature of an endowment fund.  If an endowment fund is intended to continue permanently, the institution should take special care to limit annual spending to a level that protects the purchasing power of the fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d) provides that the terms of the gift instrument can provide additional spending authority.  For example, if a gift instrument directs that an institution expend a fund over a ten-year period, exhausting the fund after ten years, spending at a rate higher than seven percent will be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d) does not require an institution to spend a minimum amount each year.  The prudence standard and the needs of the institution will supply sufficient guidance regarding whether to accumulate rather than to spend in a particular year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Spending above seven percent in any one year will not necessarily be imprudent.  For some endowment funds fluctuating spending rates may be appropriate.  Although the Act does not apply the percentage for the presumption on a rolling basis (e.g., 21 percent over three years), some endowment funds may prudently spend little or nothing in some years and more than seven percent in other years.  For example, a charity planning a construction project might decide to spend nothing from an endowment for three years and then in the fourth year might spend 20 percent of the value of the fund for construction costs.  The decision to accumulate in years one through three and then to spend 20 percent in the fourth year might be prudent for the charity, depending on the other factors.  The charity should maintain adequate records during the accumulation period and should document the decision-making process in the fourth year to be able to meet the burden of production associated with the presumption.  Another charity might prudently spend 20 percent in year one and nothing for the following three years.  That charity would also need to document the decision-making process through which the decision to spend occurred and maintain records explaining why the decision was prudent under the circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         A charity might establish a “capital replacement fund” designed to provide funds to the institution for repair or replacement of major items of equipment.  Disbursements from such a fund will likely fluctuate, with limited expenditures in some years and big expenditures in others. The fund would not exhibit a uniform spending rate.  Indeed, an advantage of a capital replacement fund is the ability to absorb a significant capital expenditure in a single year without a negative impact on the operating budget of the institution.  Disbursements might average five percent per year but would vary, with spending in some years more and in some years less.  Even if this fund is an endowment fund subject to Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>], spending above seven percent in a particular year could well be prudent.  Subsection (d) does not preclude spending above seven percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         A charity creating a capital replacement fund or a building fund might chose to adopt spending rules for the fund that would not be subject to UPMIFA.  Specific donor intent can supersede the rules of UPMIFA.  If the charity creates a gift instrument that establishes appropriate rules on spending for the fund, and if donors agree to those restrictions, then the UPMIFA rules on spending, including the bracketed presumption, will not apply.
        </p>
        <p>
         Institutions with Limited Investment and Spending Experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several attorneys general and other charity officials raised concerns about whether small institutions would be able to adjust to a spending rule based solely on prudence, without the bright-line guidance of historic dollar value.  Some charity regulators who spoke with the Drafting Committee noted that large institutions have sophisticated investment strategies, access to good investment advisors, and experience with spending rules that maintain purchasing power for endowment funds.  For these institutions, the rules of UPMIFA should work well.  For smaller institutions, however, the state regulators thought that additional guidance could be helpful.  After discussing strategies to address this concern, the Drafting Committee decided to include in these comments an additional optional provision that a state could choose to include in its UPMIFA statute.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optional provision focuses on institutions with endowment funds valued, in the aggregate, at less than $2,000,000.  The number is in brackets to indicate that it could be set higher or lower.  The number was chosen to address the concern of the state regulators that some small charities might be more likely to spend imprudently than large charities.  The Drafting Committee selected $2,000,000 as the value that might include most unsophisticated institutions but would not be overinclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optional provision creates a notification requirement for an institution with a small endowment that plans to spend below historic dollar value.  If an institution subject to the provision decides to appropriate an amount that would cause the value of its endowment funds to drop below the aggregate historic dollar value for all of its endowment funds, then the institution will have to notify the attorney general before proceeding with the expenditure.  The provision does not require that the institution obtain the approval of the attorney general before making the distribution.  Rather, the notification requirement gives the attorney general the opportunity to take a closer look at the institution and its spending decision, to educate the institution on prudent decision making for endowment funds, and to intervene if the attorney general determines that the spending would be imprudent for the institution.  Although the Drafting Committee thinks that the prudence standard in UPMIFA provides adequate guidance to all institutions within the scope of the Act, if a state chooses to adopt a notification provision for institutions with small endowments, the Drafting Committee recommends the following language:
        </p>
        <p>
         (-) If an institution has endowment funds with an aggregate value of less than [$2,000,000], the institution shall notify the [Attorney General] at least [60 days] prior to an appropriation for expenditure of an amount that would cause the value of the institution’s endowment funds to fall below the aggregate historic dollar value of the institution’s endowment funds, unless the expenditure is permitted or required under law other than this [act] or in the gift instrument.  For purposes of this subsection, “historic dollar value” means the aggregate value in dollars of (i) each endowment fund at the time it became an endowment fund, (ii) each subsequent donation to the fund at the time the donation is made, and (iii) each accumulation made pursuant to a direction in the applicable gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund.  The institution’s determination of historic dollar value made in good faith is conclusive.

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         The prudent investor standard in Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-204" target="_self">35-10-204</a></cite>] presupposes the power to delegate.  For some types of investment, prudence requires diversification, and diversification may best be accomplished through the use of pooled investment vehicles that entail delegation.  The Drafting Committee decided to put Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>] in brackets because many states already provide sufficient authority to delegate authority through other statutes.  If such authority exists, then an enacting state should enact UPMIFA without Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>].  Enacting delegation rules that duplicate existing rules could be confusing and might create conflicts.  For charitable trusts, UPIA provides the same delegation rules as those in Section 5 [§ 35-10-205].  For nonprofit corporations, nonprofit corporation statutes often provide comparable rules.  A state enacting UPMIFA must be certain that its laws authorize delegation, either through other statutes or by enacting Section 5 [§ 35-10-205].
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>] incorporates the delegation rule found in UPIA § 9, updating the delegation rules in UMIFA § 5. Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>] permits the decision makers in an institution to delegate management and investment functions to external agents if the decision makers exercise reasonable skill, care, and caution in selecting the agent, defining the scope of the delegation and reviewing the performance of the agent.  In some circumstances, the scope of the delegation may include redelegation.  For example, an institution may select an investment manager to assist with investment decisions.  The delegation may include the authority to redelegate to investment managers with expertise in particular investment areas.  All decisions to delegate require the exercise of reasonable care, skill, and caution in selecting, instructing, and monitoring agents.  Further, decision makers cannot delegate the authority to make decisions concerning expenditures and can only delegate management and investment functions. Subsection (c) protects decision makers who comply with the requirement for proper delegation from liability for actions or decisions of the agents.  In making decisions concerning delegation, the institution must be mindful of Section 3(c)(1) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-203ol1c1" target="_self">35-10-203(c)(1)</a></cite>] of UPMIFA, the provision that directs the institution  to incur only reasonable costs in managing and investing an institutional fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>] does not address issues of internal delegation and potential liability for internal delegation, and subsection (c) does not affect laws that govern personal liability of directors or trustees for matters outside the scope of Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-205" target="_self">35-10-205</a></cite>]. Directors will look to nonprofit corporation laws for these rules, while trustees will look to trust law. See , e.g., RMNCA, § 8.30(b) (permitting directors to rely on information prepared by an officer or employee of the institution if the director reasonably believes the officer or employee to be reliable and competent in the matters presented).
        </p>
        <p>
         The language of subsection (c) is similar to that of UPIA § 9(c) and RMNCA § 8.30(d).  The decision not to include the terms “beneficiaries” or “members” in subsection (c) does not indicate a decision that this section does not create immunity from claims brought by beneficiaries or members. Instead, a decision maker who complies with section 5 will be protected from any liability resulting from actions or decisions made by an external agent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d) creates personal jurisdiction over the agent. This subsection is not a choice of law rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (e) notes that law other than this Act governs internal delegation.  Section 5 of UMIFA included internal delegation as well as external delegation, due to a concern at that time that trust law concepts might govern internal delegation in nonprofit corporations. With the widespread adoption of nonprofit corporation statutes, that concern no longer exists. The decision not to address internal delegation in UPMIFA does not suggest that a governing board of a nonprofit corporation cannot delegate to committees, officers, or employees.  Rather, a nonprofit corporation must look to other law, typically a nonprofit corporation statute, for the rules governing internal delegation.

         Section 6 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-206" target="_self">35-10-206</a></cite>] expands the rules on releasing or modifying restrictions that are found in Section 7 of UMIFA. Subsection (a) restates the rule from UMIFA allowing the release of a restriction with donor consent.  Subsections (b) and (c) make clear that an institution can always ask a court to apply equitable deviation or cy pres to modify or release a restriction, under appropriate circumstances.  Subsection (d), a new provision, permits an institution to apply cy pres on its own for small funds that have existed for a substantial period of time, after giving notice to the state attorney general.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although UMIFA stated that it did not “limit the application of the doctrine of cy pres ”, UMIFA § 7(d), what that statement meant under the Act was unclear.  UMIFA itself appeared to permit only a release of a restriction and not a modification.  That all-or-nothing approach did not adequately protect donor intent.  See  Yale Univ. v. Blumenthal, 621 A.2d 1304 (Conn. 1993).  By expressly including deviation and cy pres, UPMIFA requires an institution to seek modifications that are “in accordance with the donor’s probable intention” for deviation and “in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument” for cy pres.
        </p>
        <p>
         Individual Funds.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rules on modification require that the institution, or a court applying a court-ordered doctrine, review each institutional fund separately.  Although an institution may manage institutional funds collectively, for purposes of this Section [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-206" target="_self">35-10-206</a></cite>] each fund must be considered individually.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a).  Donor Release.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a) permits the release of a restriction if the donor consents. A release with donor consent cannot change the charitable beneficiary of the fund. Although the donor has the power to consent to a release of a restriction, this section does not create a power in the donor that will cause a federal tax problem for the donor. The gift to the institution is a completed gift for tax purposes, the property cannot be diverted from the charitable beneficiary, and the donor cannot redirect the property to another use by the charity.  The donor has no retained interest in the fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b).  Equitable Deviation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b) applies the rule of equitable deviation, adapting the language of UTC § 412 to this section.  See also Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 66 (2003).  Under the deviation doctrine, a court may modify restrictions on the way an institution manages or administers a fund in a manner that furthers the purposes of the fund.  Deviation implements the donor’s intent.  A donor commonly has a predominating purpose for a gift and, secondarily, an intent that the purpose be carried out in a particular manner.  Deviation does not alter the purpose but rather modifies the means in order to carry out the purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes deviation is needed on account of circumstances unanticipated when the donor created the restriction.  In other situations the restriction may impair the management or investment of the fund.  Modification of the restriction may permit the institution to carry out the donor’s purposes in a more effective manner.  A court applying deviation should attempt to follow the donor’s probable intention in deciding how to modify the restriction.  Consistent with the doctrine of equitable deviation in trust law, subsection (b) does not require an institution to notify donors of the proposed modification.  Good practice dictates notifying any donors who are alive and can be located with a reasonable expenditure of time and money.  Consistent with the doctrine of deviation under trust law, the institution must notify the attorney general who may choose to participate in the court proceeding.  The attorney general protects donor intent as well as the public’s interest in charitable assets.  Attorney general is in brackets in the Act because in some states another official enforces the law of charities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c).  Cy Pres.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c) applies the rule of cy pres from trust law,  authorizing the court to modify the purpose of an institutional fund.  The term “modify” encompasses the release of a restriction as well as an alteration of a restriction and also permits a court to order that the fund be paid to another institution.  A court can apply the doctrine of cy pres only if the restriction in question has become unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful.  This standard, which comes from UTC § 413, updates the circumstances under which cy pres may be applied by adding “wasteful” to the usual common law articulation of the doctrine.  Any change must be made in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument.  See also Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 67 (2003).  Consistent with the doctrine of cy pres, subsection (c) does not require an institution seeking cy pres to notify donors.  Good practice will be to notify donors whenever possible.  As with deviation, the institution must notify the attorney general who must have the opportunity to be heard in the proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d).  Modification of Small, Old Funds.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (d) permits an institution to release or modify a restriction according to cy pres principles but without court approval if the amount of the institutional fund involved is small and if the institutional fund has been in existence for more than 20 years. The rationale is that under some circumstances a restriction may no longer make sense but the cost of a judicial cy pres proceeding will be too great to warrant a change in the restriction. The Drafting Committee discussed at length the parameters for allowing an institution to apply cy pres without court supervision. The Committee drafted subsection (d) to balance the needs of an institution to serve its charitable purposes efficiently with the policy of enforcing donor intent. The Committee concluded that an institutional fund with a value of $25,000 [now $150,000] or less is sufficiently small that the cost of a judicial proceeding will be out of proportion to its protective purpose. The Committee included a requirement that the institutional fund be in existence at least 20 years ,as a further safeguard for fidelity to donor intent.  The 20-year period begins to run from the date of inception of the fund and not from the date of each gift to the fund. The amount and the number of years have been placed in brackets to signal to an enacting jurisdiction that it may wish to designate a higher or lower figure.  Because the amount should reflect the cost of a judicial proceeding to obtain a modification, the number may be higher in some states and lower in others.
        </p>
        <p>
         As under judicial cy pres, an institution acting under subsection (d) must change the restriction in a manner that is in keeping with the intent of the donor and the purpose of the fund. For example, if the value of a fund is too small to justify the cost of administration of the fund as a separate fund, the term “wasteful” would allow the institution to combine the fund with another fund with similar purposes. If a fund has been created for nursing scholarships and the institution closes its nursing school, the institution might appropriately decide to use the fund for other scholarships at the institution. In using the authority granted under subsection (d), the institution must determine which alternative use for the fund reasonably approximates the original intent of the donor. The institution cannot divert the fund to an entirely different use. For example, the fund for nursing scholarships could not be used to build a football stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
         An institution seeking to modify a provision under subsection (d) must notify the attorney general of the planned modification.  The institution must wait 60 days before proceeding; the attorney general may take action if the proposed modification appears inappropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Notice to Donors.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Drafting Committee decided not to require notification of donors under subsections (b), (c), and (d).  The trust law rules of equitable deviation and cy pres do not require donor notification and instead depend on the court and the attorney general to protect donor intent and the public’s interest in charitable assets.
        </p>
        <p>
         With regard to subsection (d), the Drafting Committee concluded that an institution should not be required to give notice to donors.  Subsection (d) can only be used for an old and small fund.  Locating a donor who contributed to the fund more than 20 years earlier may be difficult and expensive.  If multiple donors each gave a small amount to create a fund 20 years earlier, the task of locating all of those donors would be harder still.  The Drafting Committee concluded that an institution’s concern for donor relations would serve as a sufficient incentive for notifying donors when donors can be located.

On proof of death of all owners, compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, and procurement of any inheritance tax waiver as required by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c08s67-8-417" target="_blank">67-8-417</a></cite>, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

       A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form, and for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes.” This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one (1) or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.

     <p>
      When the donor makes a discretionary charitable gift the following provisions apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-105ol11">
       The person to whom discretion is given shall choose the charitable beneficiaries and charitable purposes within a reasonable time after having accepted the duty to select the beneficiaries or purposes of the discretionary charitable gift.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-105ol12">
       If a donor makes a testamentary discretionary charitable gift not in trust and does not expressly designate the person to select the charitable beneficiaries or the charitable purposes, the personal representative of the donor's estate shall select the beneficiaries or the charitable purposes, or both, of the gift.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-105ol13">
       If a donor makes a testamentary discretionary charitable gift in trust and does not expressly designate the person to select the charitable beneficiaries or the charitable purposes, the trustee shall select the charitable beneficiaries or the charitable purposes, or both, of the gift and, if appropriate, shall establish a trust or charitable corporation or other legal entity to implement the discretionary charitable gift.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-105ol14">
       If the court receives notice that the person having the discretion is not ready, willing or able to perform the selection duties within a reasonable time or to establish the trust or other organization, the court shall select the person to exercise the discretion. If the discretionary gift is in trust, the court may exercise the power granted under the Uniform Trust Code, compiled in chapter 15 of this title.

The attorney general and reporter may sue and be sued, and, insofar as the suit against the attorney general and reporter is against the state, the state expressly consents to be sued.

      <p>
       Prefatory Note:  Over the quarter century from the late 1960's the investment practices of fiduciaries experienced significant change. The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) undertakes to update trust investment law in recognition of the alterations that have occurred in investment practice. These changes have occurred under the influence of a large and broadly accepted body of empirical and theoretical knowledge about the behavior of capital markets, often described as “modern portfolio theory.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act draws upon the revised standards for prudent trust investment promulgated by the American Law Institute in its Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule (1992) [hereinafter Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule; also referred to as 1992 Restatement].
      </p>
      <p>
       Objectives of the Act:  UPIA makes five fundamental alterations in the former criteria for prudent investing. All are to be found in the Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t35c14s35-14-101-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol11">
        The standard of prudence is applied to any investment as part of the total portfolio, rather than to individual investments. In the trust setting the term “portfolio” embraces all the trust's assets. UPIA § 2(b)[§ 35-14-104(b)].
       </li>
       <li id="t35c14s35-14-101-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol12">
        The tradeoff in all investing between risk and return is identified as the fiduciary's central consideration. UPIA § 2(b)[§ 35-14-104(b)].
       </li>
       <li id="t35c14s35-14-101-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol13">
        All categoric restrictions on types of investments have been abrogated; the trustee can invest in anything that plays an appropriate role in achieving the risk/return objectives of the trust and that meets the other requirements of prudent investing. UPIA § 2(e)[§ 35-14-104(e)].
       </li>
       <li id="t35c14s35-14-101-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol14">
        The long familiar requirement that fiduciaries diversify their investments has been integrated into the definition of prudent investing. UPIA § 3 [§ 35-14-105].
       </li>
       <li id="t35c14s35-14-101-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol15">
        The much criticized former rule of trust law forbidding the trustee to delegate investment and management functions has been reversed. Delegation is now permitted, subject to safeguards. UPIA § 9 [§ 35-14-111].
        <p>
         Literature:  These changes in trust investment law have been presaged in an extensive body of practical and scholarly writing. See especially the discussion and reporter's notes by Edward C. Halbach, Jr., in Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule (1992); see also Edward C.

         Legislation:  Most states have legislation governing trust-investment law. This Act promotes uniformity of state law on the basis of the new consensus reflected in the Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule. Some states have already acted. California, Delaware, Georgia, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Washington revised their prudent investor legislation to emphasize the total-portfolio standard of care in advance of the 1992 Restatement. These statutes are extracted and discussed in Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, reporter's note, at 60-66 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Drafters in Illinois in 1991 worked from the April 1990 “Proposed Final Draft” of the Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule and enacted legislation that is closely modeled on the new Restatement. 760 ILCS § 5/5 (prudent investing); and § 5/5.1 (delegation) (1992). As the Comments to this Uniform Prudent Investor Act reflect, the Act draws upon the Illinois statute in several sections. Virginia revised its prudent investor act in a similar vein in 1992. Virginia Code § 26-45.1 (prudent investing) (1992). Florida revised its statute in 1993. Florida Laws, ch. 93-257, amending Florida Statutes § 518.11 (prudent investing) and creating § 518.112 (delegation). New York legislation drawing on the new Restatement and on a preliminary version of this Uniform Prudent Investor Act was enacted in 1994. N.Y. Assembly Bill 11683-B, Ch. 609 (1994), adding Estates, Powers and Trusts Law § 11-2.3 (Prudent Investor Act).
        </p>
        <p>
         Remedies:  This Act does not undertake to address issues of remedy law or the computation of damages in trust matters. Remedies are the subject of a reasonably distinct body of doctrine. See generally Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 197-226A (1959) [hereinafter cited as Restatement of Trusts 2d; also referred to as 1959 Restatement].
        </p>
        <p>
         Implications for Charitable and Pension Trusts:  This Act is centrally concerned with the investment responsibilities arising under the private gratuitous trust, which is the common vehicle for conditioned wealth transfer within the family. Nevertheless, the prudent investor rule also bears on charitable and pension trusts, among others. “In making investments of trust funds the trustee of a charitable trust is under a duty similar to that of the trustee of a private trust.” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 389 (1959). The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the federal regulatory scheme for pension trusts enacted in 1974, absorbs trust-investment law through the prudence standard of ERISA § 404(a) (1)(B), <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)</cite>. The Supreme Court has said: “ERISA's legislative history confirms that the Act's fiduciary responsibility provisions ‘codif[y] and mak[e] applicable to [ERISA] fiduciaries certain principles developed in the evolution of the law of trusts.’” Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch
        </p>
        <p>
         Other Fiduciary Relationships:  The Uniform Prudent Investor Act regulates the investment responsibilities of trustees. Other fiduciaries — such as executors, conservators, and guardians of the property — sometimes have responsibilities over assets that are governed by the standards of prudent investment. It will often be appropriate for states to adapt the law governing investment by trustees under this Act to these other fiduciary regimes, taking account of such changed circumstances as the relatively short duration of most executorships and the intensity of court supervision of conservators and guardians in some jurisdictions. The present Act does not undertake to adjust trust-investment law to the special circumstances of the state schemes for administering decedents' estates or conducting the affairs of protected persons.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the Uniform Prudent Investor Act by its terms applies to trusts and not to charitable corporations, the standards of the Act can be expected to inform the investment responsibilities of directors and officers of charitable corporations. As the 1992 Restatement observes, “the duties of the members of the governing board of a charitable corporation are generally similar to the duties of the trustee of a charitable trust.” Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 379, Comment b , at 190 (1992). See also id. § 389, Comment b , at 190-91 (absent contrary statute or other provision, prudent investor rule applies to investment of funds held for charitable corporations).

      <p>
       This section imposes the obligation of prudence in the conduct of investment functions and identifies further sections of the Act that specify the attributes of prudent conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Origins:  The prudence standard for trust investing traces back to Harvard College v. Amory, 26 Mass. (9 Pick.) 446 (1830). Trustees should “observe how men of prudence, discretion and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested.” Id. at 461.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior Legislation:  The Model Prudent Man Rule Statute (1942), sponsored by the American Bankers Association, undertook to codify the language of the Amory  case. See Mayo A. Shattuck, The Development of the Prudent Man Rule for Fiduciary Investment in the United States in the Twentieth Century, 12 Ohio State L.J. 491, at 501 (1951); for the text of the model act, which inspired many state statutes, see id. at 508-09. Another prominent codification of the Amory  standard is Uniform Probate Code § 7-302 (1969), which provides that “the trustee shall observe the standards in dealing with the trust assets that would be observed by a prudent man dealing with the property of another…”
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress has imposed a comparable prudence standard for the administration of pension and employee benefit trusts in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), enacted in 1974. ERISA § 404(a)(1)(B), <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)</cite>, provides that “a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and … with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims….”
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior Restatement:  The Restatement of Trusts 2d (1959) also tracked the language of the Amory  case: “In making investments of trust funds the trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary … to make such investments and only such investments as a prudent man would make of his own property having in view the preservation of the estate and the amount and regularity of the income to be derived…” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 227 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objective Standard:  The concept of prudence in the judicial opinions and legislation is essentially relational or comparative. It resembles in this respect the “reasonable person” rule of tort law. A prudent trustee behaves as other trustees similarly situated would behave. The standard is, therefore, objective rather than subjective. Sections 2 through 9 of this Act [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104" target="_self">35-14-104</a></cite> — <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111" target="_self">35-14-111</a></cite>] identify the main factors that bear on prudent investment behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Variation:  Almost all of the rules of trust law are default rules, that is, rules that the settlor may alter or abrogate. Subsection (b) carries forward this traditional attribute of trust law. Traditional trust law also allows the beneficiaries of the trust to excuse its performance, when they are all capable and not misinformed. Restatement of Trusts 2d § 216 (1959).

       Section 2 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104" target="_self">35-14-104</a></cite>] is the heart of the Act. Subsections (a), (b), and (c) are patterned loosely on the language of the Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227 (1992), and on the 1991 Illinois statute, 760 § ILCS 5/5a (1992). Subsection (f) is derived from Uniform Probate Code § 7-302 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objective Standard:  Subsection (a) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104ol1a" target="_self">35-14-104(a)</a></cite>] carries forward the relational and objective standard made familiar in the Amory  case, in earlier prudent investor legislation, and in the Restatements. Early formulations of the prudent person rule were sometimes troubled by the effort to distinguish between the standard of a prudent person investing for another and investing on his or her own account. The language of subsection (a), by relating the trustee's duty to “the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust,” should put such questions to rest. The standard is the standard of the prudent investor similarly situated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Portfolio Standard:  Subsection (b) emphasizes the consolidated portfolio standard for evaluating investment decisions. An investment that might be imprudent standing alone can become prudent if undertaken in sensible relation to other trust assets, or to other nontrust assets. In the trust setting the term “portfolio” embraces the entire trust estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Risk and Return:  Subsection (b) also sounds the main theme of modern investment practice, sensitivity to the risk/return curve. See generally the works cited in the Prefatory Note to this Act, under “Literature.” Returns correlate strongly with risk, but tolerance for risk varies greatly with the financial and other circumstances of the investor, or in the case of a trust, with the purposes of the trust and the relevant circumstances of the beneficiaries. A trust whose main purpose is to support an elderly widow of modest means will have a lower risk tolerance than a trust to accumulate for a young scion of great wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104ol1b" target="_self">35-14-104(b)</a></cite>] follows Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227(a), which provides that the standard of prudent investing “requires the exercise of reasonable care, skill, and caution, and is to be applied to investments not in isolation but in the context of the trust portfolio and as a part of an overall investment strategy, which should incorporate risk and return objectives reasonably suitable to the trust.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors Affecting Investment:  Subsection (c) points to certain of the factors that commonly bear on risk/return preferences in fiduciary investing. This listing is nonexclusive. Tax considerations, such as preserving the stepped up basis on death under Internal Revenue Code § 1014 [<cite class="us_code">26 U.S.C. § 1014</cite>] for low-basis assets, have traditionally been exceptionally important in estate planning for affluent persons. Under the present recognition rules of the federal income tax, taxable investors, including trust beneficiaries, are in general best served by an investment strategy that minimizes the taxation incident to portfolio turnover. See generally Robert H. Jeffrey &amp; Robert D. Arnott, Is Your Alpha Big Enough to Cover Its Taxes?, Journal of Portfolio Management 15 (Spring 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another familiar example of how tax considerations bear upon trust investing: In a regime of pass-through taxation, it may be prudent for the trust to buy lower yielding tax-exempt securities for high-bracket taxpayers, whereas it would ordinarily be imprudent for the trustees of a charitable trust, whose income is tax exempt, to accept the lowered yields associated with tax-exempt securities.
      </p>
      <p>
       When tax considerations affect beneficiaries differently, the trustee's duty of impartiality requires attention to the competing interests of each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c)(8), allowing the trustee to take into account any preferences of the beneficiaries respecting heirlooms or other prized assets, derives from the Illinois act, 760 ILCS § 5/5(a)(4) (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty To Monitor:  Subsections (a) through (d) apply both to investing and managing trust assets. “Managing” embraces monitoring, that is, the trustee's continuing responsibility for oversight of the suitability of investments already made as well as the trustee's decisions respecting new investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty To Investigate:  Subsection (d) carries forward the traditional responsibility of the fiduciary investor to examine information likely to bear importantly on the value or the security of an investment — for example, audit reports or records of title. E.g., Estate of Collins, 72 Cal. App. 3d 663, 139 Cal. Rptr. 644 (1977) (trustees lent on a junior mortgage on unimproved real estate, failed to have land appraised, and accepted an unaudited financial statement; held liable for losses).
      </p>
      <p>
       Abrogating Categoric Restrictions:  Subsection 2(e) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104ol1e" target="_self">35-14-104(e)</a></cite>] clarifies that no particular kind of property or type of investment is inherently imprudent. Traditional trust law was encumbered with a variety of categoric exclusions, such as prohibitions on junior mortgages or new ventures. In some states legislation created so-called “legal lists” of approved trust investments. The universe of investment products changes incessantly. Investments that were at one time thought too risky, such as equities, or more recently, futures, are now used in fiduciary portfolios. By contrast, the investment that was at one time thought ideal for trusts, the long-term bond, has been discovered to import a level of risk and volatility — in this case, inflation risk — that had not been anticipated. Accordingly, section 2(e) of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104ol1e" target="_self">35-14-104(e)</a></cite>] follows Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule in abrogating categoric restrictions. The Restatement says: “Specific investments or techniques are not per se prudent or imprudent. The riskiness of a specific property, and thus the propriety of its inclusion in the trust estate, is not judged in the abstract but in terms of its anticipated effect on the particular trust's portfolio.” Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, Comment f, at 24 (1992). The premise of subsection 2(e) [§ 35-14-104(e)] is that trust beneficiaries are better protected by the Act's emphasis on close attention to risk/return objectives as prescribed in subsection 2(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104ol1b" target="_self">35-14-104(b)</a></cite>] than in attempts to identify categories of investment that are per se prudent or imprudent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act impliedly disavows the emphasis in older law on avoiding “speculative” or “risky” investments. Low levels of risk may be appropriate in some trust settings but inappropriate in others. It is the trustee's task to invest at a risk level that is suitable to the purposes of the trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The abolition of categoric restrictions against types of investment in no way alters the trustee's conventional duty of loyalty, which is reiterated for the purposes of this Act in Section 5 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-107" target="_self">35-14-107</a></cite>]. For example, were the trustee to invest in a second mortgage on a piece of real property owned by the trustee, the investment would be wrongful on account of the trustee's breach of the duty to abstain from self-dealing, even though the investment would no longer automatically offend the former categoric restriction against fiduciary investments in junior mortgages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professional Fiduciaries:  The distinction taken in subsection (f) between amateur and professional trustees is familiar law. The prudent investor standard applies to a range of fiduciaries, from the most sophisticated professional investment management firms and corporate fiduciaries, to family members of minimal experience. Because the standard of prudence is relational, it follows that the standard for professional trustees is the standard of prudent professionals; for amateurs, it is the standard of prudent amateurs. Restatement of Trusts 2d § 174 (1959) provides: “The trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust to exercise such care and skill as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property; and if the trustee has or procures his appointment as trustee by representing that he has greater skill than that of a man of ordinary prudence, he is under a duty to exercise such skill.” Case law strongly supports the concept of the higher standard of care for the trustee representing itself to be expert or professional. See Annot., Standard of Care Required of Trustee Representing Itself to Have Expert Knowledge or Skill, <cite class="alr">91 A.L.R. 3</cite>d 904 (1979) &amp; 1992 Supp. at 48-49.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Drafting Committee declined the suggestion that the Act should create an exception to the prudent investor rule (or to the diversification requirement of Section 3 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-105" target="_self">35-14-105</a></cite>]) in the case of smaller trusts. The Committee believes that subsections (b) and (c) of the Act emphasize factors that are sensitive to the traits of small trusts; and that subsection (f) adjusts helpfully for the distinction between professional and amateur trusteeship. Furthermore, it is always open to the settlor of a trust under Section 1(b) of the Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-103ol1b" target="_self">35-14-103(b)</a></cite>] to reduce the trustee's standard of care if the settlor deems such a step appropriate. The official comments to the 1992 Restatement observe that pooled investments, such as mutual funds and bank common trust funds, are especially suitable for small trusts. Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, Comments h , m , at 28, 51; reporter's note to Comment g , id. at 83.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matters of Proof:  Although virtually all express trusts are created by written instrument, oral trusts are known, and accordingly, this Act presupposes no formal requirement that trust terms be in writing. When there is a written trust instrument, modern authority strongly favors allowing evidence extrinsic to the instrument to be consulted for the purpose of ascertaining the settlor's intent. See Uniform Probate Code § 2-601 (1990), Comment; Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers (Preliminary Draft No. 2, ch. 11, Sept. 11, 1992).

       There was no breach of duty on the part of a trustee based on a lack of diversification because written documentation had been executed electing an in-kind distribution of the stocks in the estate and which acknowledged that the trustee would continue to hold “these securities” for a son's benefit; moreover, a family had owned these stocks for years, and they continued to pay large dividends to the trust during the administration period.

       The language of this section derives from Restatement of Trusts 2d § 228 (1959). ERISA insists upon a comparable rule for pension trusts. ERISA § 404(a)(1)(C), <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)</cite>(1)(C). Case law overwhelmingly supports the duty to diversify. See Annot., Duty of Trustee to Diversify Investments, and Liability for Failure to Do So, <cite class="alr">24 A.L.R. 3</cite>d 730 (1969) &amp; 1992 Supp. at 78-79.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1992 Restatement of Trusts takes the significant step of integrating the diversification requirement into the concept of prudent investing. Section 227(b) of the 1992 Restatement treats diversification as one of the fundamental elements of prudent investing, replacing the separate section 228 of the Restatement of Trusts 2d. The message of the 1992 Restatement, carried forward in Section 3 of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-105" target="_self">35-14-105</a></cite>], is that prudent investing ordinarily requires diversification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstances can, however, overcome the duty to diversify. For example, if a tax-sensitive trust owns an underdiversified block of low-basis securities, the tax costs of recognizing the gain may outweigh the advantages of diversifying the holding. The wish to retain a family business is another situation in which the purposes of the trust sometimes override the conventional duty to diversify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rationale for Diversification:  “Diversification reduces risk.… [because] stock price movements are not uniform. They are imperfectly correlated. This means that if one holds a well diversified portfolio, the gains in one investment will cancel out the losses in another.” Jonathan R. Macey, An Introduction to Modern Financial Theory 20 (American College of Trust and Estate Counsel Foundation, 1991). For example, during the Arab oil embargo of 1973, international oil stocks suffered declines, but the shares of domestic oil producers and coal companies benefitted. Holding a broad enough portfolio allowed the investor to set off, to some extent, the losses associated with the embargo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern portfolio theory divides risk into the categories of “compensated” and “uncompensated” risk. The risk of owning shares in a mature and well-managed company in a settled industry is less than the risk of owning shares in a start-up high-technology venture. The investor requires a higher expected return to induce the investor to bear the greater risk of disappointment associated with the start-up firm. This is compensated risk — the firm pays the investor for bearing the risk. By contrast, nobody pays the investor for owning too few stocks. The investor who owned only international oils in 1973 was running a risk that could have been reduced by having configured the portfolio differently — to include investments in different industries. This is uncompensated risk — nobody pays the investor for owning shares in too few industries and too few companies. Risk that can be eliminated by adding different stocks (or bonds) is uncompensated risk. The object of diversification is to minimize this uncompensated risk of having too few investments. “As long as stock prices do not move exactly together, the risk of a diversified portfolio will be less than the average risk of the separate holdings.” R.A. Brealey, An Introduction to Risk and Return from Common Stocks 103 (2d ed. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no automatic rule for identifying how much diversification is enough. The 1992 Restatement says: “Significant diversification advantages can be achieved with a small number of well-selected securities representing different industries … Broader diversification is usually to be preferred in trust investing,” and pooled investment vehicles “make thorough diversification practical for most trustees.” Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227, General Note on Comments e-h , at 77 (1992). See also  Macey, supra, at 23-24;  Brealey, supra, at 111-13.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diversifying by Pooling:  It is difficult for a small trust fund to diversify thoroughly by constructing its own portfolio of individually selected investments. Transaction costs such as the round-lot (100 share) trading economies make it relatively expensive for a small investor to assemble a broad enough portfolio to minimize uncompensated risk. For this reason, pooled investment vehicles have become the main mechanism for facilitating diversification for the investment needs of smaller trusts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most states have legislation authorizing common trust funds; see 3 Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 227.9, at 463-65 n.26 (4th ed. 1988) (collecting citations to state statutes). As of 1992, 35 states and the District of Columbia had enacted the Uniform Common Trust Fund Act (UCTFA) (1938), overcoming the rule against commingling trust assets and expressly enabling banks and trust companies to establish common trust funds. 7 Uniform Laws Ann. 1992 Supp. at 130 (schedule of adopting states). The Prefatory Note to the UCTFA explains: “The purposes of such a common or joint investment fund are to diversify the investment of the several trusts and thus spread the risk of loss, and to make it easy to invest any amount of trust funds quickly and with a small amount of trouble.” 7 Uniform Laws Ann. 402 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fiduciary Investing in Mutual Funds:  Trusts can also achieve diversification by investing in mutual funds. See Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule, § 227, Comment m, at 99-100 (1992) (endorsing trust investment in mutual funds). ERISA § 401(b)(1), <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1101(b)</cite>(1), expressly authorizes pension trusts to invest in mutual funds, identified as securities “issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940…”

       Section 4 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-106" target="_self">35-14-106</a></cite>], requiring the trustee to dispose of unsuitable assets within a reasonable time, is old law, codified in Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 229 (1992), lightly revising Restatement of Trusts 2d § 230 (1959). The duty extends as well to investments that were proper when purchased but subsequently become improper. Restatement of Trusts 2d § 231 (1959). The same standards apply to successor trustees, see Restatement of Trusts 2d § 196 (1959).

       The question of what period of time is reasonable turns on the totality of factors affecting the asset and the trust. The 1959 Restatement took the view that “[o]rdinarily any time within a year is reasonable, but under some circumstances a year may be too long a time and under other circumstances a trustee is not liable although he fails to effect the conversion for more than a year.” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 230, comment b (1959). The 1992 Restatement retreated from this rule of thumb, saying, “No positive rule can be stated with respect to what constitutes a reasonable time for the sale or exchange of securities.” Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 229, comment b  (1992).

      <p>
       The duty of loyalty is perhaps the most characteristic rule of trust law, requiring the trustee to act exclusively for the beneficiaries, as opposed to acting for the trustee's own interest or that of third parties. The language of Section 4 of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-106" target="_self">35-14-106</a></cite>] derives from Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 170 (1992), which makes minute changes in Restatement of Trusts 2d § 170 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept that the duty of prudence in trust administration, especially in investing and managing trust assets, entails adherence to the duty of loyalty is familiar. ERISA § 404(a)(1)(B), <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)</cite>(1)(B), extracted in the Comment to Section 1 of this Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-103" target="_self">35-14-103</a></cite>], effectively merges the requirements of prudence and loyalty. A fiduciary cannot be prudent in the conduct of investment functions if the fiduciary is sacrificing the interests of the beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty of loyalty is not limited to settings entailing self-dealing or conflict of interest in which the trustee would benefit personally from the trust. “The trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust not to be guided by the interest of any third person. Thus, it is improper for the trustee to sell trust property to a third person for the purpose of benefitting the third person rather than the trust.” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 170, comment q , at 371 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       No form of so-called “social investing” is consistent with the duty of loyalty if the investment activity entails sacrificing the interests of trust beneficiaries — for example, by accepting below-market returns — in favor of the interests of the persons supposedly benefitted by pursuing the particular social cause. See, e.g., John H. Langbein & Richard Posner, Social Investing and the Law of Trusts, 79 Michigan L. Rev. 72, 96-97 (1980) (collecting authority). For pension trust assets, see generally Ian D. Lanoff, The Social Investment of Private Pension Plan Assets: May it Be Done Lawfully under ERISA?, 31 Labor L.J. 387 (1980). Commentators supporting social investing tend to concede the overriding force of the duty of loyalty. They argue instead that particular schemes of social investing may not result in below-market returns. See, e.g., Marcia O'Brien Hylton, “Socially Responsible” Investing: Doing Good Versus Doing Well in an Inefficient Market, 42 American U.L. Rev. 1 (1992). In 1994 the Department of Labor issued an Interpretive Bulletin reviewing its prior analysis of social investing questions and reiterating that pension trust fiduciaries may invest only in conformity with the prudence and loyalty standards of ERISA §§ 403-404. Interpretive Bulletin 94-1, 59 Fed. Regis. 32606 (Jun. 22, 1994), to be codified as 29 CFR § 2509.94-1. The Bulletin reminds fiduciary investors that they are prohibited from “subordinat[ing] the interests of participants and beneficiaries in their retirement income to unrelated objectives.”

       The duty of impartiality derives from the duty of loyalty. When the trustee owes duties to more than one beneficiary, loyalty requires the trustee to respect the interests of all the beneficiaries. Prudence in investing and administration requires the trustee to take account of the interests of all the beneficiaries for whom the trustee is acting, especially the conflicts between the interests of beneficiaries interested in income and those interested in principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of Section 6 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-108" target="_self">35-14-108</a></cite>] derives from Restatement of Trusts 2d § 183 (1959); see also id., § 232. Multiple beneficiaries may be beneficiaries in succession (such as life and remainder interests) or beneficiaries with simultaneous interests (as when the income interest in a trust is being divided among several beneficiaries).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trustee's duty of impartiality commonly affects the conduct of investment and management functions in the sphere of principal and income allocations. This Act prescribes no regime for allocating receipts and expenses. The details of such allocations are commonly handled under specialized legislation, such as the Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act (1962) (which is presently under study by the Uniform Law Commission with a view toward further revision).

      <p>
       This section of the Act reverses the much-criticized rule that forbad trustees to delegate investment and management functions. The language of this section is derived from Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 171 (1992), discussed infra, and from the 1991 Illinois act, 760 ILCS § 5/5.1(b), (c) (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former Law:  The former nondelegation rule survived into the 1959 Restatement: “The trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary not to delegate to others the doing of acts which the trustee can reasonably be required personally to perform.” The rule put a premium on the frequently arbitrary task of distinguishing discretionary functions that were thought to be nondelegable from supposedly ministerial functions that the trustee was allowed to delegate. Restatement of Trusts 2d § 171 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Restatement of Trusts 2d admitted in a comment that “There is not a clear-cut line dividing the acts which a trustee can properly delegate from those which he cannot properly delegate.” Instead, the comment directed attention to a list of factors that “may be of importance: (1) the amount of discretion involved; (2) the value and character of the property involved; (3) whether the property is principal or income; (4) the proximity or remoteness of the subject matter of the trust; (5) the character of the act as one involving professional skill or facilities possessed or not possessed by the trustee himself.” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 171, comment d  (1959). The 1959 Restatement further said: “A trustee cannot properly delegate to another power to select investments.” Restatement of Trusts 2d § 171, comment h  (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       For discussion and criticism of the former rule see William L. Cary & Craig B. Bright, The Delegation of Investment Responsibility for Endowment Funds, 74 Columbia L. Rev. 207 (1974); John H. Langbein & Richard A. Posner, Market Funds and Trust-Investment Law, 1976 American Bar Foundation Research J. 1, 18-24.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Modern Trend To Favor Delegation:  The trend of subsequent legislation, culminating in the Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule, has been strongly hostile to the nondelegation rule. See John H. Langbein, Reversing the Nondelegation Rule of Trust-Investment Law, 59 Missouri L. Rev. 105 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Delegation Rule of the Uniform Trustee Powers Act:  The Uniform Trustee Powers Act (1964) effectively abrogates the nondelegation rule. It authorizes trustees “to employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisors, or agents, even if they are associated with the trustee, to advise or assist the trustee in the performance of his administrative duties; to act without independent investigation upon their recommendations; and instead of acting personally, to employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary…” Uniform Trustee Powers Act § 3(24), 7B Uniform Laws Ann. 743 (1985). The Act has been enacted in 16 states, see “Record of Passage of Uniform and Model Acts as of September 30, 1993,” 1993-94 Reference Book of Uniform Law Commissioners (unpaginated, following page 111) (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       UMIFA's Delegation Rule:  The Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (1972) (UMIFA), authorizes the governing boards of eleemosynary institutions, who are trustee-like fiduciaries, to delegate investment matters either to a committee of the board or to outside investment advisors, investment counsel, managers, banks, or trust companies. UMIFA § 5, 7A Uniform Laws Ann. 705 (1985). UMIFA has been enacted in 38 states, see “Record of Passage of Uniform and Model Acts as of September 30, 1993,” 1993-94 Reference Book of Uniform Law Commissioners (unpaginated, following page 111) (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       ERISA's Delegation Rule:  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the federal statute that prescribes fiduciary standards for investing the assets of pension and employee benefit plans, allows a pension or employee benefit plan to provide that “authority to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of the plan is delegated to one or more investment managers.…” ERISA § 403(a)(2), <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1103(a)</cite>(2). Commentators have explained the rationale for ERISA's encouragement of delegation:
      </p>
      <p>
       ERISA … Invites the dissolution of unitary trusteeship … ERISA's fractionation of traditional trusteeship reflects the complexity of the modern pension trust. Because millions, even billions of dollars can be involved, great care is required in investing and safekeeping plan assets. Administering such plans-computing and honoring benefit entitlements across decades of employment and retirement-is also a complex business … Since, however, neither the sponsor nor any other single entity has a comparative advantage in performing all these functions, the tendency has been for pension plans to use a variety of specialized providers. A consulting actuary, a plan administration firm, or an insurance company may oversee the design of a plan and arrange for processing benefit claims. Investment industry professionals manage the portfolio (the largest plans spread their pension investments among dozens of money management firms).John H. Langbein & Bruce A. Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 496 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Delegation Rule of the 1992 Restatement:  The Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule (1992) repeals the nondelegation rule of Restatement of Trusts 2d § 171 (1959), extracted supra, and replaces it with substitute text that reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       § 171. Duty with Respect to Delegation. A trustee has a duty personally to perform the responsibilities of trusteeship except as a prudent person might delegate those responsibilities to others. In deciding whether, to whom, and in what manner to delegate fiduciary authority in the administration of a trust, and thereafter in supervising agents, the trustee is under a duty to the beneficiaries to exercise fiduciary discretion and to act as a prudent person would act in similar circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 171 (1992). The 1992 Restatement integrates this delegation standard into the prudent investor rule of section 227, providing that “the trustee must … act with prudence in deciding whether and how to delegate to others … Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule § 227(c) (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Protecting the Beneficiary Against Unreasonable Delegation:  There is an intrinsic tension in trust law between granting trustees broad powers that facilitate flexible and efficient trust administration, on the one hand, and protecting trust beneficiaries from the misuse of such powers on the other hand. A broad set of trustees' powers, such as those found in most lawyer-drafted instruments and exemplified in the Uniform Trustees' Powers Act, permits the trustee to act vigorously and expeditiously to maximize the interests of the beneficiaries in a variety of transactions and administrative settings. Trust law relies upon the duties of loyalty and prudent administration, and upon procedural safeguards such as periodic accounting and the availability of judicial oversight, to prevent the misuse of these powers. Delegation, which is a species of trustee power, raises the same tension. If the trustee delegates effectively, the beneficiaries obtain the advantage of the agent's specialized investment skills or whatever other attributes induced the trustee to delegate. But if the trustee delegates to a knave or an incompetent, the delegation can work harm upon the beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 9 of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111" target="_self">35-14-111</a></cite>] is designed to strike the appropriate balance between the advantages and the hazards of delegation. Section 9 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111" target="_self">35-14-111</a></cite>] authorizes delegation under the limitations of subsections (a) and (b). Section 9(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111ol1a" target="_self">35-14-111(a)</a></cite>] imposes duties of care, skill, and caution on the trustee in selecting the agent, in establishing the terms of the delegation, and in reviewing the agent's compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trustee's duties of care, skill, and caution in framing the terms of the delegation should protect the beneficiary against overbroad delegation. For example, a trustee could not prudently agree to an investment management agreement containing an exculpation clause that leaves the trust without recourse against reckless mismanagement. Leaving one's beneficiaries remediless against willful wrongdoing is inconsistent with the duty to use care and caution in formulating the terms of the delegation. This sense that it is imprudent to expose beneficiaries to broad exculpation clauses underlies both federal and state legislation restricting exculpation clauses, e.g., ERISA §§ 404(a)(1)(D), 410(a), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104(a)(1)(D), 1110(a); New York Est. Powers Trusts Law § 11-1.7 (McKinney 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subsection (c) of the Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c04s35-4-111ol1c" target="_self">35-4-111(c)</a></cite>] exonerates the trustee from personal responsibility for the agent's conduct when the delegation satisfies the standards of subsection 9(a) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111ol1a" target="_self">35-14-111(a)</a></cite>], subsection 9(b) [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111ol1a" target="_self">35-14-111(a)</a></cite>] makes the agent responsible to the trust. The beneficiaries of the trust can, therefore, rely upon the trustee to enforce the terms of the delegation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs:  The duty to minimize costs that is articulated in Section 7 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-109" target="_self">35-14-109</a></cite>] of this Act applies to delegation as well as to other aspects of fiduciary investing. In deciding whether to delegate, the trustee must balance the projected benefits against the likely costs. Similarly, in deciding how to delegate, the trustee must take costs into account. The trustee must be alert to protect the beneficiary from “double dipping.” If, for example, the trustee's regular compensation schedule presupposes that the trustee will conduct the investment management function, it should ordinarily follow that the trustee will lower its fee when delegating the investment function to an outside manager.

        Use of Terms — Controlling Law and Comments
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout these comments, whether in upper or lower case, the following terms apply:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Comments,” when not preceded by or otherwise containing a reference to the comments of some matter other than these comments, mean these comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Title,” “Chapter” and “Part” respectively mean: a title of the Tennessee Code; a chapter of its relevant title therein; and a part of its relevant chapter therein.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Title 35” means title 35 of the Tennessee Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Tennessee Trust Statutes” mean any statute, together with the comments thereto, found in title 35, including but not limited to: Chapter 6, Tennessee’s adoption of the Uniform Principal and Income Act (“Tennessee Uniform Principal and Income Act”); Chapter 14, the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002 (“Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act”); Chapter 15, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code (“Tennessee Uniform Trust Code”); Chapter 16, the Tennessee Investment Services Trust Act of 2007 (Tennessee Investment Services Trust Act”); and Chapter 17, the Tennessee Community Property Trust Act of 2010 (“Tennessee Community Property Trust Act”).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Tennessee law,” individually and collectively, means any code, act, statute or law (together with any comments to such) of the state of Tennessee; or the holding or ruling of any court, judicial or administrative body of the state of Tennessee.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Uniform law,” “uniform code,” “uniform act” or “uniform legislation,” individually and collectively, mean any uniform code, act, law or other legislation (together with any amendments and comments to such) proposed for adoption by the Uniform Law Commission (“ULC,” also known as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws or “NCCUSL,” both nomenclatures being included in the acronym “ULC – NCCUSL,” sometimes referred to in these comments as “commission” and the members of which sometimes referred to in the these comments as “commissioners”). Regardless of whether or not any of the Tennessee trust statutes were or are based on any uniform law, code or act, such Tennessee trust statutes are not included within the meaning of any of the terms uniform law, uniform code or uniform act; the Tennessee trust statutes being a distinct and integrated set of trust laws, separate therefrom.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Uniform trust code” means the Uniform Trust Code (together with any amendments and comments to such) pro-posed for adoption by ULC – NCCUSL.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Section,” as well as any other subdivision of any matter, when not preceded by or otherwise containing a reference to the terms “Tennessee,” “Tennessee Code” or “T.C.A.,” means a section or other subdivision of legislation (or any other matter compiled by number), other than the sections and subdivisions thereof contained in the Tennessee Code. When the word section is followed by a number between 101 and 1106 and contains no other words modifying it or otherwise referencing it to a specific matter compiled by numbers, section means a section of the Uniform Trust Code as proposed for adoption by ULC – NCCUSL.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Restatement” means one or more restatements of the law (together with any comments thereto), individually and collectively, as such are published by the American Law Institute.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Foreign jurisdiction” means the same as does such term in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Foreign law,” individually and collectively, means any code, act, statute or law (together with any comments to such) of any foreign jurisdiction; or the holding or ruling of any court, judicial or administrative body of any foreign jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Other law,” individually and collectively, means any foreign law; any uniform law, code or act; and any restatement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout these comments any reference to a code, act, statute, law or other holding, when not preceded by or otherwise containing a reference to the word “Tennessee,” an abbreviation relative to such reference including the letters “T.C.A.” or a citation to the ruling of any court, judicial or administrative body of the state of Tennessee, refers to other law and not to Tennessee law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Controlling Law and Controlling Comments
       </p>
       <p>
        As originally adopted, numerous provisions of title 35, chapters 6, 14 and 15 were modified and diverge, in some cases significantly, from their respective uniform codes as well as related restatements. Moreover, there are no uniform code provisions addressing the subjects covered by title 35, chapters 16 and 17. Finally, since their initial adoption, various amendments to the Tennessee trust statutes have also been enacted. For example since its initial adoption in 2004, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code underwent amendment in 2005, substantial amendment in 2007, further amendment in 2010 and substantial amendment in 2013. This has resulted in further divergence from uniform law and related restatements, such divergence sometimes being significant. This divergence was undertaken deliberately and after significant consideration. Taken as a whole, the Tennessee trust statutes are a distinct and integrated set of trust laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is for this reason that the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> reverse those of section 1101 of the Uniform Trust Code and expressly state that in applying and construing title 35 no consideration shall be given to any need to promote uniformity with respect to its subject matter among states, including relative to the laws of any foreign jurisdiction that has enacted versions of the various uniform codes, laws or acts. Moreover, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> provides that unless specifically provided otherwise in title 35, chapters 6, 14, 15, 16 and 17, courts shall not consult or give any persuasive value to any such uniform acts or any foreign jurisdiction’s acts based on or similar to them; or to the comments of any of them; none of which have any force or effect relative to trusts governed by the laws of Tennessee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, regardless of the fact that throughout these comments references are made to other law, including various uniform acts and restatements, as well as to foreign law, none of such are controlling to the extent they conflict with Tennessee law. While attempts have been made throughout these comments to identify other law (e.g., by use of words such as “according to ULC - NCCUSL”), the fact that any such other law is not so identified does not alter the above.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, relative to any other law, any cross reference to Tennessee law (e.g., by inclusion of a given section from the Tennessee Code or the changing of nomenclature of various parts of codification from that used in foreign law to that used in the Tennessee Code; such as “article” to “part;” or “section” to “subsection” or “subdivision”) does not in itself signify the Tennessee law so cross-referenced is in accord with such other law, and to the extent such other law is in conflict with the cross-referenced Tennessee law, the Tennessee law controls.
       </p>
       <p>
        Default Rule
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, most of the Uniform Trust Code consists of default rules that apply only if the terms of the trust fail to address or insufficiently cover a particular issue. Pursuant to section 105 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite> ], a drafter is free to override a substantial majority of the Code’s provisions. The relatively limited number of exceptions (called “mandatory rules”) are scheduled in subsection 105(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>(b) ].
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a primary objective of the Tennessee trust statutes that a settlor’s intent be the lodestar by which a trust is interpreted, that such intent be carried out and that settlors have the freedom to dispose of their assets to whom and in the manner they wish, all to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable. Therefore, the number of mandatory rules under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code are fewer than those found in the Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite> specifically provides that the rule that states that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed has no application to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. Finally, such section provides that, except as restricted by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>(b), courts shall give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of disposition and to the enforceability of trust instruments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Innovative Provisions
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, much of the Uniform Trust Code is a codification of the common law of trusts. But the Code does contain a number of innovative provisions. Among the more significant are specification of the rules of trust law that are not subject to override in the trust's terms (section 105) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite> ], the inclusion of a comprehensive part on representation of beneficiaries (part 3) [T.C.A. §§  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> ], rules on trust modification and termination that will enhance flexibility (sections 410-417) [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite> ], and the inclusion of a part collecting the special rules pertaining to revocable trusts (part 6) [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-601" target="_self">35-15-601</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604" target="_self">35-15-604</a></cite> ].
       </p>
       <p>
        Existing Uniform Laws on Trust Law Subjects
       </p>
       <p>
        According to UCL – NCCUSL, certain older uniform acts are incorporated into the Uniform Trust Code, while other uniform acts, addressing more specialized topics, continue to be available for enactment in free-standing form. As mentioned above certain portions of the Tennessee trust statutes diverge, in some cases significantly, from the Uniform Trust Code, as well as from other uniform acts and restatements, in all cases intentionally and after significant consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to UCL – NCCUSL, the following uniform acts are incorporated into or otherwise superseded by the Uniform Trust Code:
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Probate Code (UPC) Article VII. Originally approved in 1969, Article VII has been enacted in about fifteen (15) jurisdictions. Article VII, although titled ‘Trust Administration,’ is a modest statute, addressing only a limited number of topics. Except for its provisions on trust registration, Article VII is superseded by the Uniform Trust Code. Its provisions on jurisdiction are incorporated into part 2 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-201" target="_self">35-15-201</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-204" target="_self">35-15-204</a></cite> ] of the Code, and its provision on trustee liability to persons other than beneficiaries are replaced by section 1010 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> ].
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Prudent Investor Act (1994) [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-101" target="_self">35-14-101</a></cite>  et seq.]. This Act has been enacted in thirty-five (35) jurisdictions. This Act, and variant forms enacted in a number of other states, has displaced the older ‘prudent man’ standard, bringing trust law into line with modern investment practice. States that have enacted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act are encouraged to recodify it as part of their enactment of the Uniform Trust Code. The Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002 is codified at title 35, chapter 14 and is incorporated by reference in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-901" target="_self">35-15-901</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Trustee Powers Act (1964). This Act has been enacted in sixteen (16) states. The Act contains a list of specific trustee powers and deals with other selected issues, particularly relations of a trustee with persons other than beneficiaries. The Uniform Trustee Powers Act is outdated and is entirely superseded by the Uniform Trust Code, principally at sections 815, 816, and 1012 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-815" target="_self">35-15-815</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite>,  and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite> ]. States enacting the Uniform Trust Code should repeal their existing trustee powers legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Trusts Act (1937). This largely overlooked Act of similar name was enacted in only six (6) states, none within the past several decades. Despite a title suggesting comprehensive coverage of its topic, this Act, like Article VII of the UPC, addresses only a limited number of topics. These include the duty of loyalty, the registration and voting of securities, and trustee liability to persons other than beneficiaries. States enacting the Uniform Trust Code should repeal this earlier namesake.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, the following uniform acts are not affected by enactment of the Uniform Trust Code and do not need to be amended or repealed:
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Common Trust Fund Act [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c04s35-4-101" target="_self">35-4-101</a></cite>  et seq.]. Originally approved in 1938, this Act has been en-acted in thirty-four (34) jurisdictions. The Uniform Trust Code does not address the subject of common trust funds. In recent years, many banks have replaced their common trust funds with mutual funds that may also be available to non-trust customers. The Code addresses investment in mutual funds at subsection 802(f) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802ol1f" target="_self">35-15-802(f)</a></cite>  now repealed].
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Custodial Trust Act (1987). This Act has been enacted in fourteen (14) jurisdictions. This Act allows standard trust provisions to be automatically incorporated into the terms of a trust simply by referring to the Act. This Act is not displaced by the Uniform Trust Code but complements it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (1972) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c10s35-10-101" target="_self">35-10-101</a></cite>  et seq.]. This Act has been enacted in forty-seven (47) jurisdictions. It governs the administration of endowment funds held by charitable, religious, and other eleemosynary institutions. The Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act establishes a standard of prudence for use of appreciation on assets, provides specific authority for the making of investments, authorizes the delegation of this authority, and specifies a procedure, through either donor consent or court approval, for removing restrictions on the use of donated funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Principal and Income Act (1997) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-101" target="_self">35-6-101</a></cite>  et seq.]. The 1997 Uniform Principal and Income Act is a major revision of the widely enacted uniform act of the same name approved in 1962. Because this Act addresses issues with respect both to decedent’s estates and trusts, a jurisdiction enacting the revised Uniform Principal and In-come Act may wish to include it either as part of the Uniform Trust Code or as part of its probate laws. The Tennessee version of the Uniform Principal and Income Act is as title 35, chapter 6 and has been incorporated by reference into the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-901" target="_self">35-15-901</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities. Originally approved in 1986, this Act has been enacted in twenty-seven (27) jurisdictions. The Act reforms the durational limit on when property interests, including interests created under trusts, must vest or fail. The Uniform Trust Code does not limit the duration of trusts or alter the time when interests must otherwise vest, but leaves this issue to other state law. The Code may be enacted without change regardless of the status of the perpetuities law in the enacting jurisdiction. Tennessee has adopted a modified version of this uniform act as the Tennessee Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c01s66-1-201" target="_blank">66-1-201</a></cite> et seq. The Tennessee Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities differs from the uniform act in two major respects. Unlike the uniform act, the Tennessee legislation, which was effective July 1, 1994, has always generally applied retroactively as well as prospectively, while the uniform act only applies prospectively. Moreover, as to any trust created after June 30, 2007, or that becomes irrevocable after June 30, 2007, the Tennessee legislation extends the ninety (90) year term found in the uniform act to three hundred sixty (360) years. On a related note, at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106ol1b1" target="_self">35-15-106(b)(1)</a></cite> the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code specifically abolishes the common law prohibition against accumulations of income and provides that no provision in a trust directing or authorizing accumulation of trust income is invalid.

        Uniform Supervision of Trustees for Charitable Purposes Act (1954) - This Act, which has been enacted in four States, is limited to mechanisms for monitoring the actions of charitable trustees. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Supervision of Trustees for Charitable Purposes Act does not address the substantive law of charitable trusts.

        Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act. This Act is available in two versions: the 1960 Act, with twenty four (24) enactments; and the 1991 Act, with twenty (20) enactments through 1999. As its name suggests, this Act validates pourover devises to trusts. Because it validates provisions in wills, it is incorporated into the Uniform Probate Code, not into the Uniform Trust Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        Role of Restatement of Trusts: According to ULC - NCCUSL, the Restatement (Second) of Trusts was approved by the American Law Institute in 1957. Work on the Restatement Third began in the late 1980s. The portion of Restatement Third relating to the prudent investor rule and other investment topics was completed and approved in 1990. A tentative draft of the portion of Restatement Third relating to the rules on the creation and validity of trusts was approved in 1996, and the portion relating to the office of trustee, trust purposes, spendthrift provisions and the rights of creditors was approved in 1999. The Uniform Trust Code was drafted in close coordination with the writing of the Restatement Third.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee trust statutes concur that much of the Uniform Trust Code’s coordination with, and citation in its comments to, the Restatements of Trusts is appropriate. Notwithstanding such, in certain cases the Tennessee trust statutes and comments thereto, diverge, sometimes significantly, from the provisions contained in both these Restatements of Trust, as well as in restatements covering fields of law that are related to, or impact upon, trusts. This divergence was undertaken deliberately and after significant consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106" target="_self">35-15-106</a></cite> provides that, generally, courts shall not consult, rely on or give any persuasive value to the Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 50, 56, 58, 59 or 60, nor any of their related comments because none of such have any force or effect relative to trusts governed by the laws of Tennessee.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, the Tennessee trust statutes’ retain the traditional view regarding distinctive treatment of spendthrift, mandatory, support and discretionary trusts. That view controls a number of things regarding a trust, including the Tennessee trust statutes’ retention of the traditional standard by which a trustee’s exercise or refusal to exercise discretion is judged in general, as well as regarding distributions, specifically. Therefore, the Tennessee trust statutes reject the existence of any duty of reasonableness in exercising a trustee’s discretion that is or may be implied by the Restatement (Third) of Trusts or the Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, under the Tennessee trust statutes, a beneficiary (or that beneficiary's creditors) cannot generally force a trustee to make a distribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, under the Tennessee trust statutes, a beneficiary’s interest in a discretionary trust is protected from anticipation or alienation by that beneficiary or that beneficiary’s creditors, even if the trust does not contain spendthrift protection language. Additionally, the Tennessee trust statutes provide that discretionary, support and most remainder interests are not property interests, but only expectancies, thereby facilitating stronger creditor protection, as well as the use of advanced transfer tax planning techniques.

        Overview of Uniform Trust Code and Tennessee Uniform Trust Code Differences.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Uniform Trust Code consists of eleven (11) articles, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is comprised of twelve (12) parts. The first eleven (11) track in general format and coverage the similar articles of the Uniform Trust Code, but in some cases diverge significantly from the uniform code. Moreover, unlike in the Uniform Trust Code, part 11 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains substantive as well as transitional and effective date provisions. Part twelve (12) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains detailed provisions not found in the Uniform Trust Code that provide for true directed trusts (sometimes called multi-participant or reserved powers trusts). Although Tennessee has had statutes fully providing for true directed trusts since the late 1980s, such provisions being contained in title 35, chapter 3, they were initially only addressed in the other Tennessee trust statutes by reference. Part twelve (12) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains significantly more detailed provisions governing the operation of directed trusts than do Tennessee’s original 1980s directed trust statutes. Finally, many modifications to various other provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and certain other provisions of the Tennessee trust statutes have been made to coordinate those provisions with such part twelve (12).
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 1. General Provisions and Definitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to UCL – NCCUSL, in addition to definitions, this part addresses miscellaneous but important topics. The Uniform Trust Code is primarily default law and can generally be modified by the provisions of a trust instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        This also applies to part one (1) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. However, as stated above the Tennessee trust statutes stand for the principles that a settlor’s intent is paramount and that one should have the broadest freedom to dispose of assets as that person sees fit. Therefore, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides settlors with significantly more freedom to draft trust terms departing from its default provisions than does the Uniform Trust Code. While certain limitations regarding that freedom still remain in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite>, those limitations are fewer in number and in certain cases, less restrictive, than in section 105 of the Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, unlike the Uniform Trust Code and Restatement (Third) of Trusts, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code explicitly states that any purpose of a trust that is stated by a settlor in a trust instrument to be material is to be treated as material for all purposes under the Tennessee trust statutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another goal of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is to provide significantly more certainty than does the Uniform Trust Code over the law that will control a trust and its administration. This is in accordance with Tennessee’s emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition. Therefore, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows any person having the requisite nexus (such being defined therein) with a jurisdiction to choose that jurisdiction’s law as controlling over a trust. A settlor can then designate that controlling law by including a state jurisdiction provision in a trust. When such provision designates that Tennessee law controls, Tennessee obtains jurisdiction over the trust and its law controls the validity, construction and administration of a trust (or any part thereof, as a settlor desires). In the absence of such a state jurisdiction provision, the laws of the jurisdiction where the trust was executed determine its validity and the laws of descent, while the laws of the trust’s principal place of administration determine its administration. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the terms of a governing instrument, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides that such place of administration is Tennessee if all or part of such administration takes place in Tennessee. Nevertheless, by following a relatively simple procedure, the trustee (or appropriate fiduciary) of a trust may transfer the principal place of administration to another jurisdiction within or without the United States. Moreover, unlike the Uniform Trust Code under which such power can be blocked by a single qualified beneficiary, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code requires that timely objection to the transfer be made by a majority of the qualified beneficiaries or the transfer will proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore and notwithstanding provisions contained in the Restatement (Second) Conflicts of Laws, in keeping with the policy of the state of Tennessee and its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects the concept that any law governing a trust is in any way controlled by a jurisdiction's public policy or dependent upon which jurisdiction has the most significant relationship to a matter at issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, when a state jurisdiction provision designates that Tennessee law controls, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code explicitly provides that no foreign country has any jurisdiction, power or effect over that trust or any disposition under it. Moreover, in such case no foreign country has any power to set the trust or any of its provisions aside, or at-tempt to do so. Therefore, a foreign country’s failure to recognize trusts, or the fact a trust avoids a foreign country’s laws granting rights to some person relative to property in the trust; such rights being based on a personal relationship to a settlor of, a party to, or beneficiary of, the trust; are irrelevant and are not respected by Tennessee. Any laws of a foreign country relative to forced heirship, legitime, forced share or similar rights are rejected and are unenforceable under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Therefore, no judgment of any foreign country will be recognized or enforced by Tennessee to the extent such judgment concerns a trust having a state jurisdiction provision designating the law of Tennessee as controlling.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to UCL – NCCUSL, in order to encourage nonjudicial resolution of disputes, the Uniform Trust Code provides more certainty for when such settlements are binding. While the Code does not prescribe the exact rules to be applied to the construction of trusts, it does extend to trusts whatever rules the enacting jurisdiction has on the construction of wills. The Uniform Trust Code, although comprehensive, does not legislate on every issue. Its provisions are supplemented by the common law of trusts and principles of equity.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows this model, such code contains provisions that more easily facilitate nonjudicial resolution than does the Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, as noted above there are various provisions in the Tennessee trust statutes that specifically diverge from and override what some foreign jurisdictions perceive to be appropriate “common law or principles of equity.” A few examples of such overriding Tennessee provisions include: i) the invalidity of any common law restrictions on accumulations of income; and ii) the law relative to what constitutes a discretionary trust, the construction and interpretation of same, as well as how discretion under same should be exercised. As described above, the Tennessee trust statutes’ position on the latter issue is intentionally not in accord with the common law as such is interpreted in §§ 50, 56, 58, 59 and 60 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and such sections’ comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 2. Judicial Proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part addresses selected issues involving judicial proceedings concerning trusts, particularly trusts having contacts with more than one (1) state or country. The courts in the trust’s principal place of administration have jurisdiction over both the trustee and the beneficiaries as to any matter relating to the trust. Optional provisions on subject matter jurisdiction and venue are provided. The minimal coverage of this part was deliberate. The drafting committee concluded that most issues related to jurisdiction and procedure are not appropriate to a trust code, but are best left to other bodies of law.
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the fact that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides greater certainty regarding controlling law and principal place of administration than does the Uniform Trust Code, the former likewise gives more certainty regarding appropriate subject matter jurisdiction and venue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 3. Representation.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part deals with the representation of beneficiaries and other interested persons, both by fiduciaries (personal representatives, guardians and conservators), and through what is known as virtual representation. The representation principles of the part apply to settlement of disputes, whether by a court or nonjudicially. They apply for the giving of required notices. They apply for the giving of consents to certain actions. The part also authorizes a court to appoint a representative if the court concludes that representation of a person might otherwise be inadequate. The court may appoint a representative to represent and approve a settlement on behalf of a minor, incapacitated, or unborn person or person whose identity or location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows this model, such code contains provisions that more easily facilitate virtual representation and more classes of persons can be so represented than under the Uniform Trust Code. For example, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires that there be no material  conflict of interest be-tween the representative and the person(s) represented. On the other hand the Uniform Trust Code has no such materiality threshold, thereby more often precluding virtual representation. Also under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, remote descendants can be so represented and those who are subject to any  power of appointment may be represented by the power holder. Finally a settlor or the beneficiaries can designate in writing a person or persons who can represent and bind beneficiaries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 4. Creation, Validity, Modification and Termination of Trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part specifies the requirements for creating, modifying and terminating trusts. Most of the requirements relating to creation of trusts (sections 401 through 409 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> ]) track traditional doctrine, including requirements of intent, capacity, property, and valid trust purpose. The Uniform Trust Code articulates a three-part classification system for trusts: noncharitable, charitable, and honorary. Noncharitable trusts, the most common type, require an ascertainable beneficiary and a valid purpose. Charitable trusts, on the other hand, by their very nature are created to benefit the public at large. The so called honorary or purposes trust, although unenforceable at common law, is valid and enforceable under the Uniform Trust Code despite the absence of an ascertainable beneficiary. The most common example is a trust for the care of an animal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sections 410 through 417 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite> ] provide a series of interrelated rules on when a trust may be terminated or modified other than by its express terms. The overall objective of these sections is to enhance flexibility consistent with the principle that preserving the settlor’s intent is paramount. Termination or modification may be allowed upon beneficiary consent if the court concludes that the trust or a particular provision no longer serves a material purpose or if the settlor concurs; by the court in response to unanticipated circumstances or to remedy ineffective administrative terms; or by the court or trustee if the trust is of insufficient size to justify continued administration under its existing terms. Trusts may be reformed to correct a mistake of law or fact, or modified to achieve the settlor’s tax objectives. Trusts may be combined or divided. Charitable trusts may be modified or terminated under cy pres to better achieve the settlor’s charitable purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows this model, such code contains provisions that, relative to the Uniform Trust Code: allow broader trust purposes; better facilitate the assurance of settlor’s intent; extend the enforceable periods of purpose trusts and trusts for the care of animals; as well as better facilitate the modification, termination combination or division of trusts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 5. Creditor’s Claims; Spendthrift and Discretionary Trusts.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part addresses the validity of a spendthrift provision and other issues relating to the rights of creditors to reach the trust to collect a debt. To the extent a trust is protected by a spendthrift provision, a beneficiary’s creditor may not reach the beneficiary’s interest until distribution is made by the trustee. To the extent not protected by a spendthrift provision, a creditor can reach the beneficiary’s interest, subject to the court’s power to limit the award. Certain categories of claims are exempt from a spendthrift restriction, including certain governmental claims and claims for child support or alimony. Other issues addressed in this part include creditor claims against discretionary trusts; creditor claims against a settlor, whether the trust is revocable or irrevocable; and the rights of creditors when a trustee fails to make a required distribution within a reasonable time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of part five (5) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverge, in many cases significantly, from the provisions contained in Uniform Trust Code, as well as from the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, on which much of part 5 of the Uniform Trust Code was based.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part five (5) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code offers far more creditor protection to trusts and their beneficiaries than does the Uniform Trust Code or the Restatement (Third) of Trusts. This is achieved in a number of ways, some of which are enumerated hereafter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Relative to spendthrift trusts, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-503" target="_self">35-15-503</a></cite> contains no exception creditors other than the state of Tennessee, and then only to the extent that a statute of the state of Tennessee so provides. The protection given by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to discretionary trusts is far broader than that provided by the Uniform Trust Code and, unlike under the latter, there are no exception creditors relative to an interest held in a discretionary trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        When combined with the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s definition of what constitutes a discretionary trust, only a limited number of the types of trusts typically used for donative purposes do not obtain the benefit of such creditor protection. This is in keeping with the objective of the Tennessee trust statutes that a settlor should have the broadest freedom to dispose of their assets to whom, and in the manner, they wish (and to only those persons, and in only such manner, as a settlor wishes). Such creditor protection respects that the assets in the trust initially belonged to the settlor and not the beneficiary. When those assets are put in a discretionary trust, the beneficiary obtained only beneficial rights that do not rise to the status of a property interest and, therefore, cannot be reached by creditors. Under the Tennessee trust statutes, an irrevocable special needs trust is shielded from claims by creditors of the settlor regardless of whether or not such trust complies with the provisions of chapter 16, the Tennessee Investment Services Trust Act. Finally, any interest of a beneficiary under a support trust likewise does not rise to the status of a property interest and is therefore protected from creditors, even absent a spendthrift provision. Notwithstanding the above, the Tennessee trust statutes still respect the right of beneficiaries of support and mandatory interests to obtain redress for a trustee’s failure to respect such interests due such beneficiaries under them. However, no creditor of any such beneficiary has such right and can only reach a distribution made from such interests after the distribution is made and then in only specified circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 6. Revocable Trusts.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this short part deals with issues of significance not totally settled under current law. The basic policy of this part and of the Uniform Trust Code in general is to treat the revocable trust as the functional equivalent of a will. The part specifies a standard of capacity, provides that a trust is presumed revocable unless its terms provide otherwise, prescribes the procedure for revocation or amendment of a revocable trust, addresses the rights of beneficiaries during the settlor's lifetime, and provides a statute of limitations on contests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 6 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows this model. However, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code makes it clear that no inter vivos trust need be executed with the formalities of a will and, relative to the Uniform Trust Code, has a shorter statute of limitation on contests. Part 6 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code also contains certain other differences relative to the Uniform Trust Code, such differences being in conformity with the spirit of the overall objectives of the Tennessee trust statutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 7. Office of Trustee.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part contains a series of default rules dealing with the office of trustee, all of which may be modified in the terms of the trust. Rules are provided on acceptance of office and bonding. The role of the cotrustee is addressed, including the extent that one cotrustee may delegate to another, and the extent to which one (1) cotrustee can be held liable for actions of another trustee. Also covered are changes in trusteeship, including the circumstances when a vacancy must be filled, the procedure for resignation, the grounds for removal, and the process for appointing a successor trustee. Finally, standards are provided for trustee compensation and reimbursement for expenses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 7 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows this model. However, such part is augmented by numerous provisions to provide default rules that are substantially equivalent to those dealing with the office of a trustee, but that apply to other fiduciaries that exist in the case of a directed trust governed by Part 12. Moreover, all fiduciaries have a statutory duty to keep all other fiduciaries reasonably informed about the administration of the trust to the extent such other fiduciaries do not have such knowledge. This is to assure that all such fiduciaries have the material information necessary to perform their respective duties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 8. Duties and Powers of Trustee.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part states the fundamental duties of a trustee and enumerates the trustee’s powers. The duties listed are not new, although some of the particulars have changed over the years. This part was drafted where possible to conform to the Uniform Prudent Investor Act. The Uniform Prudent Investor Act prescribes a trustee’s responsibilities with respect to the management and investment of trust property. This part also addresses a trustee’s duties regarding distributions to beneficiaries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 8 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows this model. However, such part is augmented by numerous provisions to: add flexibility; conform to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s extensive directed trust provisions; allow for “quiet” trusts under certain circumstances; require any beneficiary who is eligible to receive information concerning the trust to agree in writing to keep confidential any such information that is confidential before receiving same; and require the various fiduciaries to keep each other reasonably informed with the information necessary for them to respectively carry out their duties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, due to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s view on the distinctions among mandatory, support and discretionary interests, this part of such code contains significant variances from the Uniform Trust Code relative to the exercise of powers over such interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains a detailed but flexible statutory provision expressly authorizing a trustee having a power to invade principal to do so by appointing such principal in trust; i.e., a “decanting” power.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 9. Uniform Prudent Investor Act — Uniform Principal and Income Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part provides a place for a jurisdiction to enact, reenact or codify its version of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act [ULC - NCCUSL does not mention the Uniform Principal and Income Act relative to its part 9]. States adopting the Uniform Trust Code which have previously enacted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act are encouraged to reenact their version of the Prudent Investor Act in this part.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002, title 35, part 14, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-101" target="_self">35-14-101</a></cite> et seq., and Tennessee's version of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, title 35, part 6, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-101" target="_self">35-6-101</a></cite> et seq., were adopted prior to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. As with the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, both have been amended since their respective enactments and in certain cases, both diverge, sometimes significantly, from their respective uniform codes, as well as from various restatements. Instead of “reenacting” the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002 in part 9, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code incorporates therein by reference such act, codified at title 35, part 14, as well as Tennessee’s version of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, codified at title 35, part 6.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 10. Liability of Trustees and Rights of Persons Dealing With Trustees.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC - NCCUSL, sections 1001 through 1009 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001" target="_self">35-15-1001</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite> ] list the remedies for breach of trust, describe how money damages are to be determined, provide a statute of limitations on claims against a trustee, and specify other defenses, including consent of a beneficiary and recognition of and limitations on the effect of an exculpatory clause. Sections 1010 through 1013 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> ] address trustee relations with persons other than beneficiaries. The objective is to encourage third parties to engage in commercial transactions with trustees to the same extent as if the property were not held in trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001" target="_self">35-15-1001</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite> track in general format and coverage Uniform Trust Code sections 1001 through 1009. However, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1003" target="_self">35-15-1003</a></cite> reverses the rule of Uniform Trust Code section 1003 and provides that absent a breach of trust, a trustee is not liable for a loss or depreciation in the value of trust property or for not having made a profit. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1004" target="_self">35-15-1004</a></cite> allows trustees to use trust funds to pay fees, as well as reasonable costs and expenses incurred in a nonjudicial proceeding when the parties to the proceeding agree to such in writing. Such section also provides for an award made by mediators or arbitrators of fees, costs and expenses, relative to a proceeding involving trust administration to be paid from the trust. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite> provides: for more flexibility regarding the adequacy of disclosure of facts indicating the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust; does not require a trustee to inform a beneficiary of the time after such disclosure by which any proceeding must be commenced; and shortens in other situations the statute of limitations relative to the Uniform Trust Code from five (5) years to three (3). Such section also provides similar limitations periods for actions against a trustee for breach of trust brought by the various other fiduciaries that can exist in a directed trust or similar setting and provides that if a claim is barred against all beneficiaries, such other fiduciary is likewise barred from making a claim against a trustee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> track in general format and coverage Uniform Trust Code sections 1010 through 1013. However, T.C.A. §§  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1011" target="_self">35-15-1011</a></cite> provide a trustee with significantly greater protection from personal liability than does the Uniform Trust Code. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite>, regarding certifications of trust, diverges significantly from Uniform Trust Code section 1013.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally in keeping with the Tennessee trust statutes’ emphasis on freedom of disposition and settlor’s intent, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1014" target="_self">35-15-1014</a></cite> expressly provides for the enforceability of no-contest, in terrorem and forfeiture provisions contained in trust instruments. However, such provisions will not be enforced if the beneficiary bringing the action triggering same had probable cause to do so under grounds specified in such section. Such section also contains exceptions to enforceability of such provisions in the case of actions brought for certain other reasons, some of which include: to challenge the actions of a fiduciary to the extent that fiduciary has breached his duties; for construction or interpretation; or an agreement among persons in resolution of a matter relating to the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 11. Miscellaneous Provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC – NCCUSL, part 11 of the Uniform Trust Code is primarily an effective date provision. Moreover, the Uniform Trust Code is intended to have the widest possible application, consistent with constitutional limitations The Code applies not only to trusts created on or after the effective date, but also to trusts in existence on the date of enactment.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, as well as the Tennessee trust statutes in general, are intended to have the widest possible application, consistent with constitutional limitations, various provisions in the Tennessee trust statutes should better assure such application.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, part 11 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains multiple substantive provisions and is far more than “an effective date provision.” As covered in detail above, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> reverses the provisions of section 1101 of the Uniform Trust Code and expressly states that, relative to the subject matter of title 35, no consideration shall be given to any need to promote uniformity among states and that such other states’ acts. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains no severability clause, it being intended that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, as well as the Tennessee trust statutes in general, be fully applicable as written.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in keeping with the Tennessee trust statutes’ emphasis on freedom of disposition and settlor’s intent, part 11 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains two sections having no corresponding provision in the Uniform Trust Code. One makes it very difficult for a settlor of a trust to be deemed an alter ego of the trustee of such trust, while the other makes it exceedingly difficult to sustain that the a settlor’s or beneficiary’s influence over a trust gives either do-minion and control over such trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part 12. Miscellaneous Provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        As stated above, the Uniform Trust Code does not contain a part 12, nor does it contain similar provisions to those provided in part 12 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Part 12 (12) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains comprehensive and detailed provisions governing the operation of true directed trusts not found in the nominal coverage of “powers to direct” under section 808 of the Uniform Trust Code. Such Part 12 (12) also provides significantly more detailed provisions governing the operation of true directed trusts than do Tennessee’s original 1980s directed trust statutes. Finally, many modifications to various other provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and certain other provisions of the Tennessee trust statutes have been made to coordinate those provisions with such part twelve (12).

       <p>
        The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, while comprehensive, applies only to express trusts. Excluded from the Code’s coverage are resulting and constructive trusts, which are not express trusts but remedial devices imposed by law. For the requirements for creating an express trust and the methods by which express trusts are created, see sections 401-402 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite>  and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite> ]. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not attempt to distinguish express trusts from other legal relationships with respect to property, such as agencies and contracts for the benefit of third parties. For the distinctions, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 2 , 5 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 2 , 5-16C (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is directed primarily at trusts that arise in an estate planning or other donative context, but express trusts can arise in other contexts. For example, a trust created pursuant to a divorce action would be included, even though such a trust is not donative but is created pursuant to a bargained-for exchange.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, an express trust can be created by an entity, including but not limited to a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or any other entity of similar type to any of such (under the laws of any state, the United States of America or any foreign country, all as such terms are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>). An express trust can also be created by a trust (governed under the laws of any state, the United States of America or any foreign country, all as such terms are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>). This could happen in a number of situations. Among other ways, a trust can create another trust due to the exercise of a trustee’s power of appointment (i.e., through a decanting), or through a power holder’s exercise of any other power of appointment. Regardless, such express trusts are covered by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial trusts come in numerous forms, including trusts created pursuant to a state business trust act and trusts created to administer specified funds, such as to pay a pension or to manage pooled investments. Commercial trusts are often subject to special-purpose legislation and case law, which in some respects displace the usual rules stated in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. See  John H. Langbein, The Secret Life of the Trust: The Trust as an Instrument of Commerce, 107 Yale L.J. 165 (1997) .
       </p>
       <p>
        Express trusts also may be created by means of court judgment or decree. Examples include trusts created to hold the proceeds of personal injury recoveries and trusts created to hold the assets of a protected person in a conservatorship proceeding. See , e.g., Uniform Probate Code § 5-411(a)(4).

      </p>
      <p>
       “Power of withdrawal” means a presently exercisable general power of appointment other than a power:
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       “Property” means anything that may be the subject of ownership, whether real or personal, legal or equitable, or any interest therein;
      </p>
      <p>
       “Qualified beneficiary” means a beneficiary who, assuming the nonexercise of all powers of appointment and the nonoccurrence of any event not reasonably expected to occur, on the date the beneficiary’s qualification is determined:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal;
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date;
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subdivision (24), no ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary shall be a qualified beneficiary;
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining who is or may be an ultimate beneficiary, all of the following shall be taken into consideration:
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms of the trust naming any ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary and the intention of the settlor relative to any such beneficiary as expressed in such terms; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Any terms or provisions related to the exercise of any power by any person naming any ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary and the intention of the person exercising such power relative to any such beneficiary as expressed in such terms or provisions;
      </p>
      <p>
       Determined as provided in subdivision (24)(D)(i), an ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary is any beneficiary who the settlor or power holder did not reasonably anticipate would take any interest upon termination of all or any part of a trust absent all other beneficiaries or members of classes of beneficiaries named in the trust instrument or in the exercise of the power, respectively, predeceasing or otherwise not being in existence at the time at which such trust or part thereof terminates;
      </p>
      <p>
       By way of example and not in limitation of this subdivision (24)(D), an ultimate beneficiary is a person or persons often included in a trust instrument or under the exercise of a power to take an interest in a trust at the time all or any part of such trust terminates only in a case where all other named beneficiaries or classes of beneficiaries that have or had an affinity through either familial connection or friendship with any of:
      </p>
      <p>
       The settlor;
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       “Reach” means, with respect to a distribution interest or any power held by anyone relative to a trust, to subject such distribution interest or such power to a judgment, decree, garnishment, attachment, execution, levy, creditor’s bill or other legal, equitable, or administrative process, relief, or control of any court, tribunal, agency, or other entity that, by power of law, is provided with powers or jurisdiction similar to those described in this subdivision (25);
      </p>
      <p>
       “Remainder interest” means an interest under which a trust beneficiary will receive property held by a trust outright at some time during the future; relative to a remainder interest:
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the existence of a remainder interest or the provision of services by a spouse in that spouse’s capacity as a fiduciary of the trust creating the remainder interest is relevant in the equitable division of marital property;
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the factors in subdivision (26)(A) or the exercise or non-exercise of any power or discretion by a spouse in that spouse’s capacity as a fiduciary of the trust creating the remainder interest (even if that spouse is also a beneficiary of the trust creating the remainder interest) are relevant to, indicative of or effect the transmutation or other conversion of separate property to community property;
      </p>
      <p>
       The expending of any community funds by a spouse in that spouse’s capacity as a fiduciary of the trust creating the remainder interest relative to the operation or maintenance of property related to a remainder interest is not relevant to or indicative of, and does not effect a transmutation or other conversion of separate property to community property;
      </p>
      <p>
       Any funds expended pursuant to subdivision (26)(C) shall be valid debts of the trust and shall be repaid to the community with appropriate interest;

       “Reserved power” means a power held by a settlor;
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       “Settlor” means a person, including a testator, who creates, or contributes property to, a trust. If more than one (1) person creates or contributes property to a trust, each person is a settlor of the portion of the trust property attributable to that person’s contribution except to the extent another person has the power to revoke or withdraw that portion;
      </p>
      <p>
       “Spendthrift provision” means a term of a trust which restrains both voluntary and involuntary transfer of a beneficiary's interest;
      </p>

         Trustee did not breach a duty under this statute by failing to convey personal assets to a trust in order to avoid probate administration and expenses; it was not shown that the trustee administered the trust in a manner that was inconsistent with the beneficial interest of the beneficiaries. Glass v. Suntrust Bank, 523 S.W.3d 61, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 305 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 4, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 710 (Tenn. Sept. 26, 2016).

         Section Comment.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Action.” A definition of “action” is included for drafting convenience, to avoid having to clarify in the numerous places in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code where reference is made to an “action” by the trustee that the term includes a failure to act.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Another state or “other state” The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code has always had a definition of “state.” A definition of “another state” or “other state,” along with definitions of “foreign” or “foreign country, “foreign jurisdiction” and “this state” were added by the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Throughout the Tennessee trust statutes and comments thereto, all of such terms have the meaning ascribed to them respectively in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Statutory definitions of these terms are included for multiple reasons, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
         Having such statutorily defined terms provides drafting convenience and avoids having to clarify in a document any subject covered by such terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains detailed provisions regarding governing law. Under such provisions, neither the laws of any foreign country nor any judgment or similar holding of any foreign country’s tribunals are recognized or enforceable by this state. Therefore, such foreign law and holdings have no force or effect over a trust (or distribution therefrom) when that trust is governed by Tennessee law.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code also has detailed provisions governing place of administration of a trust and the nexus required to determine such principal place of administration. These provisions regarding nexus also impact the ability for one to make a state jurisdiction provision in a trust. Including the above statutorily defined terms facilitates all such above provisions, as well as other provisions throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         From time to time the parties to or that have an interest in a trust, the transactions and other matters pertaining to a trust, as well as the provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in general, touch more than one domestic jurisdiction or both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In such cases, having such statutorily defined terms facilitates determination of whether Tennessee law alone applies, or due to constitutional limitations the law of another state or of the United States must be considered. Such statutorily defined terms also facilitate a clear demarcation between limitations or requirements of the U.S. constitution and the chimera and nonbinding nature of comity relative to the laws and holdings of a foreign country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the comments under “foreign” or “foreign country,” under “foreign jurisdiction,” as well as under “this state,” are incorporated herein by reference. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code
        </p>
        <p>
         “Ascertainable standard.” The 2007 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code added a definition of “ascertainable standard,” thereby making it apply generally throughout the Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Beneficial interest.” Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, a beneficial interest must either be a distribution interest or a remainder interest as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. The Tennessee trust statutes do not provide for any other form or type of beneficial interest. See below for comments regarding distribution interests and remainder interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         A beneficial interest does not include either: a power of appointment or a reserved power as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. See below for comments regarding powers of appointment and reserved powers. For this reason, under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the holder of a power of appointment is not a beneficiary, such being a divergence from the Uniform Trust Code. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Beneficiary.” This term refers only to a beneficiary of a trust as such is defined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. In addition to living and ascertained individuals, beneficiaries may be unborn or unascertained. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite> a trust must have a beneficiary unless the trust is: a charitable trust; for the care of an animal; or for a noncharitable purpose. Moreover, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite>, a trust that requires a beneficiary is valid only if a beneficiary can be ascertained now or in the future. The term “beneficiary” includes not only beneficiaries who received their interests under the terms of the trust but also beneficiaries who received their interests by other means, including by assignment, exercise of a power of appointment, resulting trust upon the failure of an interest, gap in a disposition, operation of an antilapse statute upon the predecease of a named beneficiary, or upon termination of the trust. The fact that a person incidentally benefits from the trust does not mean that the person is a beneficiary. For example, neither a trustee nor persons hired by the trustee become beneficiaries merely because they receive compensation from the trust. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 48 cmt. c (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 126  cmt. c (1959).
        </p>
        <p>
         Tennessee law is consistent with the common law of trusts that the holder of a power of appointment is not considered a trust beneficiary. Contrastingly, ULC - NCCUSL’s position in the Uniform Trust Code, which provides that the holder of a power of appointment is classified as a beneficiary, is in conflict with both Tennessee law and common law in general.
        </p>
        <p>
         The definition of “beneficiary” includes only those who hold beneficial interests in the trust. Because a charitable trust is not created to benefit ascertainable beneficiaries but to benefit the community at large (See section 405(a) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-405ol1a" target="_self">35-15-405(a)</a></cite> ]), persons receiving distributions from a charitable trust are not beneficiaries as that term is de-fined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Notwithstanding the above, a charitable organization expressly designated to receive distributions under the terms of a charitable trust are granted the rights of a qualified beneficiary under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, but only if such charitable organization otherwise holds beneficial interests sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
         For reasons similar to those applying to charitable trusts, neither any animal under a trust for the care of an animal as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite>, nor anyone (person, entity or otherwise) benefiting from or having an interest in the purpose for which a trust is established under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> are beneficiaries as that term is defined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, relative to trusts controlled by T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>, there are no qualified beneficiaries. Nevertheless, both such Tennessee statutes provide mechanisms under which one or more persons, or a court, can enforce such types of trusts.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code leaves certain issues concerning beneficiaries to the common law. Any person with capacity to take and hold legal title to intended trust property has capacity to be a beneficiary. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 43 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 116 -119 (1959). Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the extent of a beneficiary's interest is determined solely by the settlor's intent to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable. Unlike in the Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not require that such intent be limited by public policy. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 49 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 127 -128 (1959); but to the extent either of such restatements are in conflict with Tennessee law, the latter controls. While most beneficial interests terminate upon a beneficiary's death, the interest of a beneficiary may devolve by will or intestate succession the same as a corresponding legal interest. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 55(1) (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 140 , 142 (1959).
        </p>
        <p>
         “Charitable trust.” Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, when a trust has both charitable and noncharitable beneficiaries only the charitable portion qualifies as a “charitable trust.” The great majority of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s provisions apply to both charitable and noncharitable trusts without distinction. The distinctions between the two types of trusts are found in the requirements relating to trust creation and modification. Pursuant to sections 405 and 413 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-405" target="_self">35-15-405</a></cite>  and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> ], a charitable trust must have a charitable purpose and charitable trusts may be modified or terminated under the doctrine of cy pres. Also, section 411 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> ] allows a noncharitable trust to in certain instances be terminated by its beneficiaries while charitable trusts do not have beneficiaries in the usual sense. To the extent of these distinctions, a split-interest trust is subject to two sets of provisions, one applicable to the charitable interests, the other the noncharitable.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Conservator.” See the comments below under “guardian,” which include comments relative to a conservator.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Directed trust.” This term refers to true directed trusts as provided for in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808" target="_self">35-15-808</a></cite> as opposed to a delegation of a fiduciary’s duties as provided for in T.C.A. §  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807" target="_self">35-15-807</a></cite>. Under a true directed trust, certain powers and duties that were historically and traditionally bundled in a single trustee, or in cotrustees, are removed from such and directed to other fiduciaries. Alternatively, certain other trust advisors or trust protectors are given various powers and duties relative to other fiduciaries (including trustees and cotrustees). To the extent a power or duty is removed from one fiduciary and given to another, the fiduciary from which the power or duty was removed is called an excluded fiduciary. An excluded fiduciary generally has no liability for the powers or duties so removed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other names for directed trusts include “multi-participant trusts” and “reserved power trusts.” Tennessee has had statutes fully providing for true directed trusts since the late 1980s, such provisions being contained in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-122" target="_self">35-3-122</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-123" target="_self">35-3-123</a></cite>. However, such statutes were initially only addressed in the other Tennessee trust statutes by reference. As used here, the term directed trust includes trusts controlled by T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-122" target="_self">35-3-122</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-123" target="_self">35-3-123</a></cite> to the extent provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808" target="_self">35-15-808</a></cite>, as well as to other trusts as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808" target="_self">35-15-808</a></cite>, including those subject to part 12. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Distribution beneficiary.” One who holds a distribution interest under a trust. A distribution beneficiary is a beneficiary who is an eligible or permissible distributee of income or principal under such distribution interest. A distribution beneficiary, in their capacity as a distribution beneficiary, does not hold a remainder interest. This is true regardless of whether such beneficiary holds a remainder interest in some capacity other than as a distribution beneficiary. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Distribution interest.” Before discussing the term distribution interest in detail, it is beneficial to consider why the concept of distribution interest; together with the related concepts expressed by the terms beneficial interest, distribution beneficiary, reach, remainder interest, and to a lesser extent power of appointment and reserved power; are crucial to understanding Tennessee law as it relates to trusts.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of the above terms are in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> and are discussed in these comments. Such terms are essential elements of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Together with other provisions in the Tennessee trust statutes, the concepts behind these terms are designed to assure traditional Tennessee law concepts are preserved regarding spend-thrift, mandatory, support and discretionary trusts, together with their concomitant rights, benefits, creditor and other protections. They are also essential elements of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s emphasis on settlor’s intent, freedom of disposition and certainty of construction and interpretation. Finally, these concepts determine whether an inter-est under a trust does or does not rise to the status of a property interest. Of course, that issue, in itself, has a significant bearing on implementing settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition, as well as on creditor and other protections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Established and traditional common law made clear distinctions among the treatment of spendthrift, mandatory, discretionary and support trusts. Tennessee courts have traditionally followed that traditional, established common law, which is reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Trusts. Some of the effects of these distinctions are noted in the comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite>, near the end of the section entitled, “Existing Uniform Laws on Trust Law Subjects.” Therein it discusses the effect of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106" target="_self">35-15-106</a></cite>, which rejects the Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 50, 56, 58, 59 or 60, and such sections’ comments. Other effects of these distinctions, including when a distribution interest does or does not rise to the status of a property interest and the effect of same, are noted in the comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite> in the last paragraph under the heading, “Part 5. Creditor's Claims; Spendthrift and Discretionary Trusts.”
        </p>

         The Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts do not make these clear distinctions, leaving settlors without certainty as to the meaning and effect of language used relative to spendthrift, mandatory, support and discretionary trust provisions. Moreover, language in the Restatement (Third) of Trusts indicates that even if the terms of a trust specifically give a trustee “absolute, sole and unfettered” discretion, such Restatement infers a “reasonableness” standard relative to the exercise (or non-exercise) of that discretion. Uniform Trust Code section 814(a), and the comments thereunder (but not T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite>), refer one to section 50 of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts. The comments under that section include the “reasonableness” standard mentioned above, thereby infusing the Uniform Trust Code with the Restatement’s “reasonableness” standard. A number of legal authors believe such provisions of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and the Uniform Trust Code virtually always give any beneficiary an enforceable right to a distribution, thereby eviscerating the meaning of the word “discretionary.” Regardless of how clear and obvious a drafter is regarding a settlor’s intent to create a purely and absolutely discretionary trust, these authors believe such provisions of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and the Uniform Trust Code result in nothing other than a vague “continuum” of rights and discretion that only lead to uncertainty and needless litigation. Moreover, it would not be illegitimate for one to be concerned that this “continuum” puts one on a slippery slope that could lead to a creditor of a beneficiary being able to reach that beneficiary’s now (under the Restatement (Third) of Trusts) and Uniform Trust Code, potentially enforceable right to a distribution. Of course this significantly reduces the creditor protection traditionally afforded to beneficiaries of third-party discretionary trusts.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are just a few of the reasons that Tennessee law relative to trusts rejects certain portions of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and the Uniform Trust Code, and in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code codifies the prior, established and traditional common law.
        </p>
        <p>
         In its broadest terms, a distribution interest is a beneficial interest, other than a remainder interest, held by a distribution beneficiary under a trust. Distribution interests may be current distribution interests or future distribution interests. The fact that a beneficial interest is a distribution interest controls many things relative to that interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Distribution interests are separate as opposed to marital property for the purposes of an equitable division of marital property and therefore, are not relevant to such division. The fact that a spouse provides services in that spouse’s capacity as a fiduciary of the trust that created the distribution interest (or to such distribution interest) does not change the above and the provision of such services or the results from or effects of such provision do not give rise to marital property. Therefore, neither the provision of such services, nor the results from or effects of such provision of services, are relevant to such division.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the purposes of determining separate versus community property in a jurisdiction recognizing community property as the applicable marital property regime in that jurisdiction:
        </p>
        <p>
         Distribution interests are likewise separate property. Similarly, the fact that a spouse provides services in that spouse’s capacity as a fiduciary of the trust that created the distribution interest (or to such distribution interest) does not change the above and the provision of such services or the results from or effects of such provision do not give rise to marital or community property, nor is any of the above relevant to, indicative of, or does such effect, the transmutation or other conversion of separate property to community property . Moreover, in cases where a spouse is serving in such capacity as trustee of such trust, neither the exercise or non-exercise of any power or discretion by such spouse in such capacity as trustee give rise to marital or community property, nor is such relevant to, indicative of, or does such effect, the transmutation or other conversion of separate property to community property. This remains true even if the spouse is also a beneficiary of the trust that created the distribution interest (or of the distribution interest).
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the expending of any community funds by a spouse in such spouse’s capacity as a fiduciary of such trust that created the distribution interest, relative to the operation or maintenance of property related to such distribution interest, is not relevant to or indicative of, and does not effect, a transmutation or other conversion of separate property to community property. Instead any such expending of funds simultaneously creates a correspondingly equal and valid debt of the trust to the community and such debt shall be repaid to the community with appropriate interest from the assets of the trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         Distribution interests can be classified in one of three ways.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first classification is a mandatory interest. At least as to principal, it is also the least likely type of interest one normally encounters under the Tennessee trust statutes. In order to be a mandatory interest, a distribution interest must require distribution within one year of the date the right to the distribution arises and the trustee must have no discretion, whatsoever, relative to the making of or the amount of this distribution. The most common form of mandatory interest occurs when a trust directs that all the income or a specified dollar amount be distributed every year. Even where such mandatory interests exist under a trust, all non-mandatory distribution interests under such trust are either support or discretionary interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second classification is a support interest. In order to be a support interest, a distribution interest, though not a mandatory interest, must either contain: mandatory language such as “shall make,” (and as stated below, such mandatory language is not otherwise negated) and be coupled with a standard capable of judicial determination; or must contain specific language that a trustee’s discretion be exercised in a “reasonable” manner. While more common, these are likely not that prevalent either, especially as such relate to principal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third classification is a discretionary interest. All distribution interests that are not either a mandatory or support distributions, and under which a trustee has any discretion to make or withhold a distribution, are discretionary interests. The fact that a standard, even one referring to “support,” is included in the distribution language will not convert a discretionary interest to a support interest unless the standard is coupled with mandatory language such as “shall make.” Moreover, even where such mandatory language is used, if such is negated (e.g., “shall make in the trustee’s discretion”) or subsequently qualified by discretionary language, the distribution interest is a discretionary interest and not a support or mandatory interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, should distribution language indicate any combination of a mandatory, support and discretionary interest, the combined interest is to be divided, with each distribution interest treated as the relevant type of distribution interest only to the extent of the respective different distribution language used.
        </p>
        <p>
         For all these reasons, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code gravitates toward creation of discretionary interests versus support or mandatory interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the definition of distribution interest in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> there are a number of examples of distribution language, which while not exclusive, indicates one of the three types of distribution interests. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Environmental law.” To encourage trustees to accept and administer trusts containing real property, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains several provisions designed to limit exposure to possible liability for violation of environmental law. Section 701(c)(2) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701ol1c2" target="_self">35-15-701(c)(2)</a></cite> ] authorizes a nominated trustee to investigate trust property to determine potential liability for violation of environmental law or other law without accepting the trusteeship. Section 816(13) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816ol1b13" target="_self">35-15-816(b)(13)</a></cite> ] grants a trustee comprehensive and detailed powers to deal with property involving environmental risks. Finally, unlike Uniform Trust Code section 1010(b), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> immunizes a trustee from personal liability for violation of environmental law arising from the ownership and control of trust property.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Excluded fiduciary.” This term is included to define any person who would otherwise meet the definition of fiduciary, but who is relieved in one of the prescribed manners from any power or duty normally held by such relevant fiduciary and that power or duty is granted or reserved to another person.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> only specifically includes any “trustee,” “trust advisor” or “trust protector” as being potential excluded fiduciaries, such section of the Tennessee Code should be read to include anyone who would otherwise meet the definition of fiduciary contained in T.C.A. §  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, but who is relieved in one of the prescribed manners from any power or duty normally held by such relevant fiduciary and that power or duty is granted or reserved to another person. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Fiduciary.” This term is included for several reasons, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
         To facilitate drafting by providing an all-inclusive word meaning any person having fiduciary powers and duties under the Tennessee trust statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         To cover trust advisors and trust protectors under part 12, or otherwise, if any of such are serving in a fiduciary capacity as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1202" target="_self">35-15-1202</a></cite> or elsewhere under the Tennessee trust statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         To assure that any person, regardless of the nomenclature by which that person is called, when holding powers and carrying out duties that are normally fiduciary in nature is a fiduciary, unless that person is an excluded fiduciary. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Foreign” or “foreign country.” The comments under “another state” or “other state” are incorporated herein by reference.
        </p>
        <p>
         The distinctive statutory definition of the word “foreign,” either by itself or followed by the word “country” is included to demarcate the different meaning of those words, particularly “foreign,” in the Tennessee trust statutes from the meaning generally ascribed to the term foreign in state statutes (including the Tennessee Code in places other than under the Tennessee trust statutes) and in state court holdings and similar rulings. Outside the Tennessee trust statutes, the word “foreign” is often used simply to denote another state of the United States. However, the appropriate term for such under the Tennessee trust statutes is “another state” or “other state,” while “foreign” either by itself or followed by “country” means a jurisdiction other than the United States or a state (as such is defined in T.C.A. §  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>). Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Foreign jurisdiction.” The comments under “another state” or “other state,” under “foreign” or “foreign country,” as well as under “this state,” are incorporated herein by reference.
        </p>
        <p>
         By combining the word “foreign” with “jurisdiction,” the latter word being the generalized term for an area or matter under some domestic or foreign governmental control or authority, this statutory definition includes any jurisdiction (governmental authority) other than that of this state, the state of Tennessee.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is included for similar reasons as those set forth under “foreign” or “foreign country,” above. It is also included for drafting convenience. By simply stating “foreign jurisdiction” a drafter can mean any other jurisdiction than that of this state, Tennessee. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Guardian.” Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, both the term “guardian” and the term “conservator” have the same meaning as they respectfully do in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.34.html#t34c01s34-1-101" target="_blank">34-1-101</a></cite>. Under such section; guardian means a person or persons appointed by the court to provide partial or full supervision, protection and assistance of the person or property, or both, of a minor; while conservator means a person or persons appointed by the court to provide partial or full supervision, protection and assistance of the person or property, or both, of a disabled person.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Interests of the beneficiaries.” The phrase “interests of the beneficiaries” (subdivision (8)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol117" target="_self">35-15-103(17)</a></cite> ] is used with some frequency in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. The definition clarifies that the interests are as provided in the terms of the trust and not as determined by the beneficiaries. Absent authority to do so in the terms of the trust, section 108 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite> ] prohibits a trustee from changing a trust's principal place of administration if the transfer would violate the trustee's duty to administer the trust at a place appropriate to the interests of the beneficiaries. Section 706(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706ol1b" target="_self">35-15-706(b)</a></cite> ] conditions certain of the grounds for removing a trustee on the court's finding that removal of the trustee will best serve the interests of the beneficiaries. Section 801 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite> ] requires the trustee to administer the trust in the interests of the beneficiaries, and section 802 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802" target="_self">35-15-802</a></cite> ] makes clear that a trustee may not place its own interests above those of the beneficiaries. Section 808(d) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808ol1d" target="_self">35-15-808(d)</a></cite> ] requires the holder of a power to direct who is subject to a fiduciary obligation to act with regard to the interests of the beneficiaries. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1202" target="_self">35-15-1202</a></cite> provides likewise. Section 1002(b) [T.C.A. §  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002ol1b" target="_self">35-15-1002(b)</a></cite> ] may impose greater liability on a cotrustee who commits a breach of trust with reckless indifference to the interests of the beneficiaries. Section 1008 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite> ] invalidates an exculpatory term to the extent it relieves a trustee of liability for breach of trust committed with reckless indifference to the interests of the beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Internal Revenue Code.” The definition of “internal revenue code” was added to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> with the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. The term as now defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> appeared in certain sections throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, while in certain other places in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and its comments it was referred to generically as “Internal Revenue Code,” or by similar words or abbreviations therefor. The 2013 amendments included the term’s definition in T.C.A. § 35-15-103 to make it consistently applicable throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Nevertheless, it is still appropriate to refer to the Internal Revenue Code by its initials “I.R.C.” or through a full citation to title 26 of the United States Code or an abbreviation thereof. Moreover, a citation to “Treas. Reg. §” is an appropriate way to cite to the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, as is a full citation to title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations or an abbreviation thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Jurisdiction.” (subdivision (9) [T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c05s35-5-103ol119" target="_self">35-5-103(19)</a></cite> ], when used with reference to a geographic area, includes a state or country but is not necessarily so limited. Its precise scope will depend on the context in which it is used. “Jurisdiction” is used in sections 107 and 403 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107" target="_self">35-15-107</a></cite>  and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-403" target="_self">35-15-403</a></cite> ] to refer to the place whose law will govern the trust. The term is used in section 108 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite> ] to refer to the trust’s principal place of administration. The term is used in section 816 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite> ] to refer to the place where the trustee may appoint an ancillary trustee and to the place in whose courts the trustee can bring and defend legal proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Person.” The definition in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> is self sufficiently clear and needs no further explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Power of appointment.” A power of appointment as defined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is a matter of state property law and not federal tax law; although there is considerable overlap between the two definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
         A power of appointment is authority to designate the recipients of beneficial interests in property. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Donative Transfers § 11.1  (1986). A power is either general or nongeneral (such sometimes being called “special”) and either presently exercisable or not presently exercisable. A general power of appointment is a power exercisable in favor of the holder of the power, the power holder’s creditors, the power holder’s estate, or the creditors of the power holder’s estate. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Donative Transfers § 11.4  (1986). All other powers are nongeneral (such sometimes being called “special powers of appointment”). A power is presently exercisable if the power holder can currently create an interest, present or future, in an object of the power. A power of appointment is not presently exercisable if exercisable only by the power holder's will or if its exercise is not effective for a specified period of time or until occurrence of some event. See Restatement (Second) of Property: Donative Transfers § 11.5  (1986). Powers of appointment may be held in either a fiduciary or nonfiduciary capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code makes distinctions among types of powers. Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-302" target="_self">35-15-302</a></cite> the holder of any type of power of appointment may represent and bind persons whose interests are subject to the power. A “power of withdrawal” is defined as a presently exercisable general power of appointment other than a power exercisable by a trustee and limited by an ascertainable standard, or a power which is exercisable by another person only upon consent of the trustee or a person holding an adverse interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code makes two things crystal clear: A power of appointment, even when held by a trustee or other fiduciary, is different and distinct from any trustee’s or other fiduciary’s power to make decisions regarding distributions. Moreover, powers of appointment are held by the person to whom such power has been given in the distinct and singular capacity of a power holder. Therefore, if a settlor is given a power of appointment, such settlor holds that power of appointment as a power holder and not in that person’s capacity as settlor. Portions of the above (appropriately amended) were moved from the comment pertaining to beneficiary, while other portion of the above were added, both such types of changes were done to conform with the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, which added a separate definition for “power of appointment.”
        </p>
        <p>
         “Power of withdrawal.” The definition of “power of withdrawal,” was amended in 2007 to exclude a possible inference that the term includes a discretionary power in a trustee to make distributions for the trustee’s own benefit which is limited by an ascertainable standard. This was done to clarify that if a beneficiary is serving as trustee or co-trustee and has discretion to make a distribution to himself or for his own benefit pursuant to an ascertainable standard, then the creditor cannot reach or compel a distribution except to the extent the interest would be subject to a creditor's claim if the beneficiary were not acting as trustee or co-trustee.
        </p>
        <p>
         “Property.” The definition of “property” (subdivision (12)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol123" target="_self">35-15-103(23)</a></cite> ] is intended to be as expansive as possible and to encompass anything that may be the subject of ownership. Included are choses in action, claims, and interests created by beneficiary designations under policies of insurance, financial instruments, and deferred compensation and other retirement arrangements, whether revocable or irrevocable. Any such property interest is sufficient to support creation of a trust. See section 401 Section Comment [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite> ].
        </p>
        <p>
         “Qualified beneficiary.” Due to the difficulty of identifying beneficiaries whose interests are remote and contingent, and because such beneficiaries are not likely to have much interest in the day-to-day affairs of the trust, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code uses the concept of “qualified beneficiary” (subdivision (12) [§ T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol124" target="_self">35-15-103(24)</a></cite> ]) to limit the class of beneficiaries to whom certain notices must be given or consents received. The definition of qualified beneficiaries is used in section 705 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite> ] to define the class to whom notice must be given of a trustee resignation. The term is used in section 813 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite> ] to define the class that generally has the right to request from a trustee information regarding the trust’s administration. Section 417 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite> ] requires that notice be given to the qualified beneficiaries before a trust may be combined or divided. Actions which may be accomplished by the consent of the qualified beneficiaries include the appointment of a successor trustee as provided in section 704 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> ], as well as the appointment of successor trust advisors and trust protectors. Prior to transferring a trust’s principal place of administration, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite> requires that the trustee give at least 60 days notice to the qualified beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to ULC - NCCUSL, the qualified beneficiaries consist of the beneficiaries currently eligible to receive a distribution from the trust together with those who might be termed the first-line remaindermen. These are the beneficiaries who would become eligible to receive distributions were the event triggering the termination of a beneficiary’s interest or of the trust itself to occur on the date in question. Such a terminating event will typically be the death or deaths of the beneficiaries currently eligible to receive the income. Should a qualified beneficiary be a minor, incapacitated, or unknown, or a beneficiary whose identity or location is not reasonably ascertainable, the representation and virtual representation principles of part 3 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> ] may be employed, including the possible appointment by the court of a representative to represent the beneficiary’s interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to ULC - NCCUSL, the qualified beneficiaries who take upon termination of the beneficiary’s interest or of the trust can include takers in default of the exercise of a power of appointment. The term can also include the persons entitled to receive the trust property pursuant to the exercise of a power of appointment. Because the exercise of a testamentary power of appointment is not effective until the testator’s death and probate of the will, the qualified beneficiaries do not include appointees under the will of a living person. Nor would the term include the objects of an unexercised inter vivos power.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code generally follows ULC - NCCUSL’s position as expressed in the prior two paragraphs. However, the group of persons who potentially qualify as qualified beneficiaries under Tennessee law is meaningfully smaller. Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, as of any (and as of each) point in time at which it is necessary to determine which beneficiaries are qualified beneficiaries you do so assuming the following two things (neither of which are required by the Uniform Trust Code): any and all then existing powers of appointment will not be exercised; and any event then not reasonably expected to occur will not occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, under its definition of “qualified beneficiary” the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides that no ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary can ever be a qualified beneficiary or have the rights thereof. Additionally, no ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary has the standing to petition to remedy a breach of trust or to enforce a trust; the interests of such beneficiary being too remote. Notwithstanding the preceding portion of this paragraph, if and when the interests of any ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary have ripened to the point that such beneficiary is eligible to receive, or have paid for their benefit, current distributions of income or principal, at such time they will no longer be an “ultimate beneficiary” or “potential ultimate beneficiary.” At such time such beneficiary has all the rights of any other current beneficiary of the same type, charitable or non-charitable. Similarly if a trust for animals or a trust for a noncharitable purpose (individually and collectively, “purpose trust”) is an ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary, the rights of any person provided in [either] T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> or § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> to enforce the trust under which such purpose trust is an ultimate, or potential ultimate beneficiary will not ripen until such purpose trust is eligible to receive from the trust under which it was previously an ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary, current distributions of income or principal.

       If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

        T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> contains a detailed definition of who is included in the meaning of the term “ultimate beneficiary.” Such section then goes on to give the following example of one type of person or group of persons who meet the definition of such term:
       </p>
       <p>
        “[A] person or persons often included in a trust instrument or under the exercise of a power to take an interest in a trust at the time all or any part of such trust terminates only in a case where all other named beneficiaries or classes of beneficiaries that have or had an affinity through either familial connection or friendship with any of: the settlor; the person holding any power; or any prior beneficiary or potential beneficiary of the trust; are predeceased or are otherwise not in existence at the time all or any part of the trust terminates.” Also by way of example, one may describe an ultimate beneficiary as that person or persons who take an interest if all of the natural objects (close or remote) of the relevant person’s bounty predecease the termination of all or part of a trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Charitable trusts do not have beneficiaries in the usual sense. However, certain persons, while not technically beneficiaries, do have an interest in seeing that the trust is enforced. Therefore, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite> grants the rights of qualified beneficiaries to charitable organizations expressly designated to receive distributions under the terms of a charitable trust and whose beneficial interests are sufficient to satisfy the definition of qualified beneficiary if the trust were not a charitable trust. Finally, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite> grants the rights of a qualified beneficiary with respect to a charitable trust to the attorney general of Tennessee.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Reach.” This term describes in the broadest manner possible, any means by which any judicial process, or any other process by power of law, may subject a distribution interest or any power held by anyone relative to a trust, to such process; usually, but not always, for the purpose of satisfying a claim, judgment or similar obligation with assets of a trust, or otherwise obtaining assets either from a trust or that were in a trust in the past. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Remainder interest.” A remainder interest is the interest by which a beneficiary receives property held by a trust outright at some time in the future. All other beneficial interests are distribution interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a remainder interest is separate or marital property for purposes of, or is otherwise relevant to, an equitable division of property; and whether a remainder interest remains separate property or is in any way relevant to, indicative of or effects, any transmutation or other conversion of separate property to community property; is controlled by standards that are equivalent to those that apply to distribution interests. Moreover provisions equivalent to those pertaining to a distribution interest regarding the use of community funds relative to the operation or maintenance of property subject to such distribution interest likewise control remainder interests in similar situations. Added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Reserved power.” This term literally includes any power held by a settlor, so long as that power was retained or kept by the settlor at the inception of the trust. A reserved power is not a beneficial interest. Moreover, a power given to a settlor by someone other than the settlor is not a reserved power, nor is it a beneficial interest. If a power is so given by another to a settlor and that power includes the power to direct the disposition of trust property, other than as a distribution decision made by a trustee or other fiduciary to a beneficiary, then such power is a power of appointment for all purposes under the Tennessee trust statutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The term reserved power was added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to clarify the above. Trusts with reserved powers are common throughout the various jurisdictions within the United States. A revocable trust (or revocable living trust) is perhaps the penultimate example of a trust with reserved powers (or a reserved power trust). Moreover, one often encounters the use of the terms “reserved power” or “reserved power trust” outside the United States in Commonwealth jurisdictions. Therefore, this term was also included in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in order to assure that persons more familiar with trusts created under the laws of Commonwealth jurisdictions would understand similar reserved power trusts were likewise fully available in Tennessee.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Revocable.” The definition of “revocable” (subdivision (13)) [T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol128" target="_self">35-15-103(28)</a></cite> ] clarifies that revocable trusts include only trusts whose revocation is substantially within the settlor’s control. The fact that the settlor becomes incapacitated does not convert a revocable trust into an irrevocable trust. The trust remains revocable until the settlor’s death or the power of revocation is released. The consequences of classifying a trust as revocable are many. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains provisions relating to liability of a revocable trust for payment of the settlor’s debts (section 505) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505" target="_self">35-15-505</a></cite> ], the standard of capacity for creating a revocable trust (section 601) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-601" target="_self">35-15-601</a></cite>], the procedure for revocation (section 602) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite> ], the subjecting of the beneficiaries’ rights to the settlor’s control (section 603) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite> ], the period for contesting a revocable trust (section 604) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604" target="_self">35-15-604</a></cite> ], the power of the settlor of a revocable trust to direct the actions of a trustee (section 808(a)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808ol1a" target="_self">35-15-808(a)</a></cite> ], notice to certain beneficiaries and other persons upon the trust becoming irrevocable (section 813(b)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813ol1b" target="_self">35-15-813 (b)</a></cite> ], and the liability of a trustee of a revocable trust for the obligations of a partnership of which the trustee is a general partner (section 1011 (d)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1011ol1d" target="_self">35-15-1011(d)</a></cite> ].
       </p>
       <p>
        Because under section 603(c) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603ol1c" target="_self">35-15-603(c)</a></cite> ] the holder of a power of withdrawal has the rights of a settlor of a revocable trust, the definition of “power of withdrawal” and “revocable” under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> are similar. Both exclude individuals who can exercise their power only with the consent of the trustee or person having an adverse interest although the definition of “power of withdrawal” excludes powers subject to an ascertainable standard, a limitation which is not present in the definition of “revocable.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Settlor.” The definition of “settlor” (subdivision (14)) [T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol129" target="_self">35-15-103(29)</a></cite> ] refers to the person who creates, or contributes property to, a trust, whether by will, self-declaration, transfer of property to another person as trustee, or exercise of a power of appointment. For the requirements for creating a trust, see section 401 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite> ]. Determining the identity of the “settlor” is usually not an issue. The same person will both sign the trust instrument and fund the trust. Ascertaining the identity of the settlor becomes more difficult when more than one person signs the trust instrument or funds the trust. The fact that a person is designated as the “settlor” by the terms of the trust is not necessarily determinative. For example, the person who executes the trust instrument may be acting as the agent for the person who will be funding the trust. In that case, the person funding the trust, and not the person signing the trust instrument, will be the settlor. Should more than one person contribute to a trust, all of the contributors will ordinarily be treated as settlors in proportion to their respective contributions, regardless of which one signed the trust instrument. See  section 602(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602ol1b" target="_self">35-15-602(b)</a></cite> ].
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of a revocable trust employed as a will substitute, gifts to the trust’s creator are sometimes made by placing the gifted property directly into the trust. To recognize that such a donor is not intended to be treated as a settlor, the definition of “settlor” excludes a contributor to a trust that is revocable by another person or over which another person has a power of withdrawal. Thus, a parent who contributes to a child’s revocable trust would not be treated as one of the trust’s settlors. The definition of settlor would treat the child as the sole settlor of the trust to the extent of the child’s proportionate contribution. Pursuant to section 603(c) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603ol1c" target="_self">35-15-603(c)</a></cite> ], the child’s power of withdrawal over the trust would also result in the child being treated as the settlor with respect to the portion of the trust attributable to the parent’s contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to ULC – NCCUSL, ascertaining the identity of the settlor is important for a variety of reasons. It is important for determining rights in revocable trusts. See  subdivisions 505(a)(1), (3) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505ol1a1" target="_self">35-15-505(a)(1)</a></cite>, (6) ] (creditor claims against settlor of revocable trust), section 602 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite> ] (revocation or modification of revocable trust), and section 604 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604" target="_self">35-15-604</a></cite> ] (limitation on contest of revocable trust). It is also important for determining rights of creditors in irrevocable trusts. See  subdivision 505(a)(2) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505ol1a2" target="_self">35-15-505(a)(2)</a></cite> ] (creditors of settlor can reach maximum amount trustee can distribute to settlor). While the settlor of an irrevocable trust traditionally has no continuing rights over the trust except for the right under section 411 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> ] to terminate the trust with the beneficiaries’ consent, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code also authorizes the settlor of an irrevocable trust to petition for removal of the trustee and to enforce or modify a charitable trust. See  subsection 405(c) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-405ol1c" target="_self">35-15-405(c)</a></cite> ] (standing to enforce charitable trust), section 413 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> ] (doctrine of cy pres), and section 706 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite> ] (removal of trustee).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code general would agree with ULC - NCCUSL’s position as stated in the immediately preceding paragraph. However the TUTC diverges from the Uniform Trust Code in several ways relative to the matter discussed in such paragraph, including the following:
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the comments in such paragraph relative to Uniform Trust Code section 411, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>, a settlor need not consent in advance to a modification or termination of an irrevocable trust. Instead, upon consent of all qualified beneficiaries to modify or terminate a trust, such proposed action may be taken if a settlor does not object to same within sixty (60) days (or a greater number of days if the proposal to modify or terminate so provides) of being provided notice of the proposed action by the trustee. Such notice has certain requirements as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the comments in such paragraph relative to Uniform Trust Code section 505, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505" target="_self">35-15-505</a></cite>, relative to irrevocable trusts there are certain exceptions to ULC - NCCUSL’s statement that “creditors of settlor can reach maximum amount trustee can distribute to settlor.” First Tennessee does grant creditor protection under prescribed conditions to a settlor of a Tennessee Investment Services Trust created under title 35, chapter 16. Second, an irrevocable special needs trust is shielded from claims by creditors of the settlor regardless of whether or not such trust complies with the provisions of title 35, chapter 16. Third, no person holding a power of withdrawal is considered a settlor by failing to exercise such power or letting it lapse. Therefore, because such person is not a settlor, the provisions regarding creditors’ ability to reach maximum amount trustee can distribute to settlor simply are not applicable. Fourth, a power of appointment is held by the person to whom such power has been given as a power holder not by a settlor in that person’s capacity as a settlor. Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, neither a power of appointment nor a power reserved by a settlor is a beneficial interest. Therefore, a holder of either, in their capacity holding either, is not a beneficiary. For this reason, a creditor of a settlor cannot reach the rights incident to a power of appointment held by a settlor to appoint to persons other than the settlor, nor can they reach a reserved power at the level of the holder to the extent that reserved power is not equivalent to a power to revoke a trust. Fifth, a person who becomes a beneficiary of a trust due to the exercise of a power of appointment by someone other than such person is not considered under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to be a settlor of a trust. This is true even if the person who so became the beneficiary created and funded the trust and granted the power of appointment to another. Therefore, if the settlor did not otherwise retain a beneficial interest in the trust that was otherwise reachable (e.g., the settlor did not name himself as a beneficiary of the trust at the time it was created) the mere fact that some other person exercises a power of appointment to later make the settlor a beneficiary will not create an interest that is reachable by the settlor’s creditors.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Spendthrift provision.” (subdivision (15)) [T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol130" target="_self">35-15-103(30)</a></cite> ] means a term of a trust which restrains the transfer of a beneficiary’s interest, whether by a voluntary act of the beneficiary or by an action of a beneficiary’s creditor or assignee, which at least as far as the beneficiary is concerned, would be involuntary. A spendthrift provision is valid under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only if it restrains both voluntary and involuntary transfer. For a discussion of this requirement and the effect of a spendthrift provision in general, see section 502 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-502" target="_self">35-15-502</a></cite> ].
       </p>
       <p>
        Note regarding prior language contained in these comments relative to spendthrift provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the original adoption of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in 2004, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> omitted language similar to or in accord with Uniform Trust Code section 411(c), as well as language similar to or in accord with the ULC – NCCUSL comments to such section of the Uniform Trust Code. Such language of Uniform Trust Code section 411(c) so omitted reads as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        “A spendthrift provision in the terms of the trust is not presumed to constitute a material purpose of the trust.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Such language of the comments to Uniform Trust Code section 411(c) so omitted reads as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Subsection (c) of this section deals with the effect of a spendthrift provision on the right of a beneficiary to concur in a trust termination or modification. Spendthrift terms have sometimes been construed to constitute a material purpose without inquiry into the intention of the particular settlor. For examples, see Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 337 (1959); George G. Bogert & George T. Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees Section 1008 (Rev. 2d ed. 1983); and 4 Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts Section 337 (4th ed. 1989). This result is troublesome because spendthrift provisions are often added to instruments with little thought. Subsection (c), similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts Section 65 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), does not negate the possibility that continuation of a trust to assure spendthrift protection might have been a material purpose of the particular settlor. The question of whether that was the intent of a particular settlor is instead a matter of fact to be determined on the totality of the circumstances.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of Restatement (Third) of Trusts Section 65 cmt. e., citied by ULC - NCCUSL above is more dismissive of spendthrift provisions and their protective nature. It is also dismissive of the protective nature of discretionary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite omitting from T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> such language above from Uniform Trust Code section 411(c), the original Tennessee Uniform Trust Code failed to omit the concordant ULC - NCCUSL commentary language from these comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, which state:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The insertion of a spendthrift provision in the terms of the trust may also constitute a material purpose sufficient to prevent termination of the trust by agreement of the beneficiaries under section 411 [T.C.A § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> ], although the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not presume this result.”
       </p>
       <p>
        This left such comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> in conflict with the statutory language of (as well as the comments to) T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>. For that reason, the 2013 amendments to the TUTC strike from the comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> relative to spendthrift provisions the immediately preceding paragraph contained in quotation marks. After the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such code is silent on this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nevertheless, in furtherance of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s overriding goals of respecting settlor’s in-tent and freedom of disposition, the 2013 amendments add the following language to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Any purpose enunciated as a material purpose of a trust in that trust’s trust instrument shall be treated as a material purpose of that trust for all purposes of this chapter and chapter 16.” As stated in the comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>, such results in a settlor also having the power to so enumerate that a purpose of a trust is not a material purpose of a trust for all purposes of this chapter and chapter 16.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore, a settlor can, with greater certainty through drafting, control understanding of that settlor’s intent as to what is or is not a material purpose as to any purpose of a trust, including that of a spendthrift provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        “State.” The definition in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> is self sufficiently clear and needs no further explanation.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Successors in interest.” The definition in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> is self sufficiently clear and needs no further explanation. However, one reason for including it is to facilitate drafting.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Terms of a trust.” (subdivision (18)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol133" target="_self">35-15-103(33)</a></cite> ] is a defined term used frequently in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. While the wording of a written trust instrument is almost always the most important determinant of a trust’s terms, the definition is not so limited. Oral statements, the situation of the beneficiaries, the purposes of the trust, the circumstances under which the trust is to be administered, and, to the extent the settlor was otherwise silent, rules of construction, all may have a bearing on determining a trust’s meaning. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 4 cmt. a (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 4  cmt. a (1959). If a trust established by order of court is to be administered as an express trust, the terms of the trust are determined from the court order as interpreted in light of the general rules governing interpretation of judgments. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 4 cmt. f (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A manifestation of a settlor’s intention does not constitute evidence of a trust’s terms if it would be inadmissible in a judicial proceeding in which the trust’s terms are in question. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 4 cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 4  cmt. b (1959). See  also Restatement (Third) Property: Donative Transfers §§ 10.2, 11.1-11.3 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995). For example, in many states a trust of real property is unenforceable unless evidenced by a writing, although section 407 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-407" target="_self">35-15-407</a></cite> ] of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code internally does not so require. Evidence otherwise relevant to determining the terms of a trust may also be excluded under other principles of law, such as the parol evidence rule.

This statutory definition was primarily included for drafting convenience and to assure clarity. By using the term “this state” in a trust governed by the law of Tennessee, a drafter knows Tennessee will be the term’s resulting meaning.

Section 403 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-403" target="_self">35-15-403</a></cite> ] provides that a trust is validly created if created in compliance with the law of the place where the trust instrument was executed. Pursuant to subdivision 604(a)(2) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604ol1a2" target="_self">35-15-604(a)(2)</a></cite> ], the contest period for a revocable trust can be shortened by providing the potential contestant with a copy of the trust instrument plus other information. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite> requires that the trustee furnish certain beneficiaries and certain holders of power of appointment with a copy of the trust instrument or an abstract thereof, in the trustee’s discretion. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite> allows: the terms of the trust; as well as the settlor in any event, or any trust advisor or trust protector that holds the power to so direct, to direct otherwise in writing to the trustee. In other words, unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows “quiet” trusts. To allow a trustee to administer a trust with some dispatch without concern about liability if the terms of a trust instrument are contradicted by evidence outside of the instrument, section 1006 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1006" target="_self">35-15-1006</a></cite> ] protects a trustee from liability to the extent a breach of trust resulted from reasonable reliance on those terms. Section 1013 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> ] allows a trustee to substitute a certification of trust in lieu of providing a third person with a copy of the trust instrument. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1103" target="_self">35-15-1103</a></cite> provides that unless there is a clear indication of a contrary intent, rules of construction and presumptions provided in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code apply to trust instruments executed before the effective date of such Code.

        “Trustee.” The definition of “trustee” (subdivision (19)) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103ol138" target="_self">35-15-103(38)</a></cite> ] includes not only the original trustee but also an additional and successor trustee as well as a cotrustee. Because the definition of trustee includes trustees of all types, any trustee, whether original or succeeding, single or cotrustee, has the powers of a trustee and is subject to the duties imposed on trustees under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Any natural person, including a settlor or beneficiary, has capacity to act as trustee if the person has capacity to hold title to property free of trust. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 32 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 89  (1959). State banking statutes normally impose additional requirements before an entity can act as trustee.

        Section Comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section specifies when a person is deemed to know a fact. Subsection (a) states the general rule. Subsection (b) provides a special rule dealing with notice to organizations. Pursuant to subsection (a), a fact is known to a person if the person had actual knowledge of the fact, received notification of it, or had reason to know of the fact’s existence based on all of the circumstances and other facts known to the person at the time. Under subsection (b), notice to an organization is not necessarily achieved by giving notice to a branch office. Nor does the organization necessarily acquire knowledge at the moment the notice arrives in the organization’s mailroom. Rather, the organization has notice or knowledge of a fact only when the information is received by an employee having responsibility to act for the trust, or would have been brought to the employee’s attention had the organization exercised reasonable diligence.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Know” is used in its defined sense in sections 109 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-109" target="_self">35-15-109</a></cite> ] (methods and waiver of notice), section 305 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> ] (appointment of representative), subsection 604(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604ol1b" target="_self">35-15-604(b)</a></cite> ] (limitation on contest of revocable trust), section 812 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-812" target="_self">35-15-812</a></cite> ] (collecting trust property), section 1009 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite> ] (nonliability of trustee upon beneficiary’s consent, release, or ratification), and section 1012 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite> ] (protection of person dealing with trustee). But as to certain actions, a person is charged with knowledge of facts the person would have discovered upon reasonable inquiry. See  section 1005 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite> ] (limitation of action against trustee following report of trustee). In addition, for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite>, a person will be deemed to have received adequate disclosure of facts thereunder if they had sufficient knowledge to be presumed to know them or to be put on notice to inquire into their existence.

         Trustees were under a mandatory obligation to distribute the remaining principal of such child's separate trust to such child, when the terminating event or events occurred, and because the trust did not provide otherwise, the trustees were to perform this task expeditiously, which they failed to do; because the trustees failed to take the appropriate actions for two years following the termination of the trust, the trial court was justified in ordering the clerk to prepare a deed to transfer the real estate to the beneficiaries.

         Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.

         The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the policy of the state of Tennessee, as well as the overriding objective of the Tennessee trust statutes: that a settlor’s intent be the lodestar by which a trust is interpreted; that such intent be carried out; and that settlors have the freedom to dispose of their assets to whom and in the manner they wish; all to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Significantly more strongly than does the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite> emphasizes that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is primarily a default statute. While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides numerous procedural rules on which a settlor may wish to rely, the settlor is generally free to override these rules and to prescribe the conditions under which the trust is to be administered. Subject to only the limited exceptions contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> (which are fewer in number and in certain cases, less restrictive, than in section 105 of the Uniform Trust Code), the duties and powers of a trustee, relations among trustees, and the rights and interests of a beneficiary are as specified in the terms of the trust. Moreover, in certain cases there need be no specific reference to the intent to override such default rules. One example of the myriad ways in which a settlor can override the default rules contained in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is that a settlor may override an otherwise applicable duty of loyalty in the terms of the trust. Sometimes such override is implied. For example, the grant to a trustee of authority to make a discretionary distribution to a class of beneficiaries that includes the trustee implicitly authorizes the trustee to make distributions for the trustee’s own benefit. Another way a settlor can override the default rules is such settlor can relieve a fiduciary from acting in good faith (such not being included in T.C.A. § 35-15-(b)(2).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to do its utmost to assure all of the above, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects the rule of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The subdivisions contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> (referred to hereafter in the comment to this section as “subdivision”) list the items not subject to override in the terms of the trust:
        </p>
        <p>
         Subdivision (b)(1) confirms that the requirements for a trust’s creation, such as the necessary level of capacity and the requirement that a trust have a legal purpose, are controlled by statute and common law, not by the settlor. For the requirements for creating a trust, see T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>. Nevertheless, unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains no references to any impact of public policy on the purposes of a trust as such relates to the requirements for creating a trust under subdivisions (b)(1) or (b)(3).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subdivision (b)(2) provides that the terms may not eliminate a trustee’s duty to act in accordance with the terms and purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains no reference to good faith in subdivision (b)(2). Therefore, a settlor may provide a standard other than good faith, (e.g., the Trustee's sole and absolute discretion, which standard under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains no implied good faith or reasonableness standard) to govern the Trustee's actions. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite> for the standard by which a trustee’s exercise of discretion relative to a discretionary interest may be judicially reviewed or a distribution judicially forced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, absent some other restriction, a settlor is always free to specify the trust’s terms and the interests of the beneficiaries, to both of which the trustee must comply. Subdivision (b)(3) emphasizes that the “interests of the beneficiaries” are to be judged by such terms “as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust.” The Uniform Trust Code does not contain language similar to that contained in the last set of quotation marks above. Such language was added to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code due to its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition. Therefore, throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, whenever one encounters the phrase “that a trust and its terms be for the benefit of its beneficiaries” (or a similar phrase), one should automatically add to such phrase the remaining portion subdivision (b)(3), “as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Under subdivision (b)(4), the power of the court to modify or terminate a trust under T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite> is not subject to variation in the terms of the trust. However, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite> involve situations which the settlor could have addressed had the settlor had sufficient foresight. These include situations where the purpose of the trust has been achieved, a mistake was made in the trust’s creation, or circumstances have arisen that were not anticipated by the settlor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subdivision (b)(5) clarifies that a settlor may not restrict the rights of a beneficiary’s creditors to a greater ex-tent than is allowed as provided in part 5.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conformity with traditional doctrine, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code limits the ability of a settlor to exculpate a trustee from liability for breach of trust. The limits are specified in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite>. Subdivision (b)(8) provides a cross-reference. Similarly, subdivision (b)(7) provides a cross-reference to section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-708ol1b" target="_self">35-15-708(b)</a></cite>, which limits the binding effect of a provision specifying a trustee’s, as well as a trust advisor’s or trust protector’s compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subdivision (b)(9) clarifies that a settlor is not free to limit the rights of third persons, such as purchasers of trust property.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subdivision (b)(10) makes clear that the settlor may not reduce any otherwise applicable period of limitations for commencing a judicial proceeding. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604" target="_self">35-15-604</a></cite> (period of limitations for contesting validity of revocable trust), and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite> (period of limitation on action for breach of trust), as well as similar provisions regarding limitations periods applicable to trust advisors, trust protectors and other fiduciaries. Similarly, a settlor may not so negate the responsibilities of a trustee that the trustee would no longer be acting in a fiduciary capacity. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in a directed trust one or more fiduciary powers and duties can be removed from a trustee and given to another fiduciary, in which case relative to the powers and duties so removed, that trustee will be an excluded fiduciary.
        </p>
        <p>
         The terms of a trust may not deny a court authority to take such action as necessary in the interests of justice, including requiring that a trustee furnish bond, which are acknowledged by subdivisions (b)(11) and (b)(6), respectively. Additionally, subdivision (b)(12) similarly provides that provisions on subject matter jurisdiction and venue cannot be altered in the terms of the trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, Tennessee allows “quiet” trusts, under which information regarding a trust and its operations may, if certain requirements are met, be withheld from beneficiaries and holders of powers of appointment. Because of this, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code has no provision corresponding with Uniform Trust Code subsections (b)(8) and (b)(9).
        </p>
        <p>
         To assure the overriding objectives of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code as stated in the third paragraph of these section comments to this section, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1c" target="_self">35-15-105(c)</a></cite> makes it clear that the materiality of any purpose of the trust can be controlled simply by stating such in a trust instrument. While the language of such subsection (c) is written in the positive, (i.e., “Any purpose enunciated as a material purpose… shall be treated as a material purpose…”), such necessarily implies that a settlor also has the power to so enumerate that a purpose of a trust is not a material purpose of a trust for all purposes of this chapter and chapter 16.
        </p>
       </li>

       If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

         Section Comment.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to ULC – NCCUSL, the Uniform Trust Code codifies those portions of the law of express trusts that are most amenable to codification.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code would agree that no code can cover all portions of the law of express trusts, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code codifies meaningfully more of such portions than does the Uniform Trust Code. The additional codification of the law of express trusts in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is intentional and is designed to provide significantly more certainty than does the Uniform Trust Code over the law that will control a trust and its administration. This is in accordance with Tennessee’s emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, because it is impossible to codify all portions of the law of express trust, to the extent such are not codified in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such code is supplemented by the common law of trusts, including principles of equity. To determine the common law and principles of equity, a court or other body adjudicating or mediating a matter is instructed to look first to other portions of the Tennessee trust statutes, then to prior and contemporaneous Tennessee law. If a court or other body adjudicating or mediating a matter cannot resolve the matter using Tennessee law, it may then look to other law (excluding the law of any foreign country), including the various applicable restatements. Regardless, to the extent any other law is in conflict with Tennessee law, Tennessee law controls. The common law of trusts also includes the traditional and broad equitable jurisdiction of the court, which the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in no way restricts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, when considering law other than Tennessee law, courts and other bodies adjudicating or mediating a matter are instructed to be mindful of the following:
        </p>
        <p>
         Numerous provisions of title 35, chapters 6, 14 and 15 were modified and diverge, in some cases significantly, from their respective uniform codes and the Restatements of Trust, as well as from restatements covering fields of law that are related to, or impact upon, trusts. Moreover, there are no uniform code provisions addressing the subjects covered by title 35, chapters 16 and 17. Such resulting divergence was undertaken deliberately and after significant consideration. Taken as a whole, the Tennessee trust statutes are a distinct and integrated set of trust laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is for this reason that the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> reverse those of section 1101 of the Uniform Trust Code and expressly state that in applying and construing title 35 no consideration shall be given to any need to promote uniformity with respect to its subject matter among states, including relative to the laws of any foreign jurisdiction that has enacted versions of the various uniform codes, laws or acts. Moreover, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> provides that unless specifically provided otherwise in title 35, chapters 6, 14, 15, 16 and 17, courts shall not consult or give any persuasive value to any such uniform acts or any foreign jurisdiction’s acts based on or similar to them; or to the comments of any of them; none of which have any force or effect relative to trusts governed by the laws of Tennessee.
        </p>
        <p>
         The statutory text of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is also supplemented by these Comments, which, like the Comments to any uniform act, may be relied on as a guide for interpretation.

          The 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code completely and significantly rewrote this section, leaving the former version inoperative as provided in the enacting and transitional language of Section 55, Pub. Act. 2013, Pub. Ch. 390, 108th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Tenn., 2013). Such amendment also made section 107 of the Uniform Trust Code, as well as the comments thereunder, irrelevant to the current T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107" target="_self">35-15-107</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is designed to provide significantly more certainty than does the Uniform Trust Code over the law that will control a trust and its administration. This is in accordance with Tennessee’s emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition. Therefore, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows any person having the requisite nexus (defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>) with a jurisdiction to choose that jurisdiction’s law as controlling over a trust. A settlor can then designate that controlling law by including a state jurisdiction provision in a trust. The jurisdiction selected need not have any other connection to the trust. Moreover, a settlor is free to select the governing law regardless of where the trust property may be physically located, whether it consists of real or personal property, and whether the trust was created by will or during the settlor’s lifetime.
         </p>
         <p>
          Furthermore and notwithstanding certain provisions contained in the Restatement (Second) Conflicts of Laws, in keeping with the policy of the state of Tennessee and its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent and of freedom of disposition, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects the concept that any law governing a trust is in any way controlled by another jurisdiction’s public policy or dependent upon which jurisdiction has the most significant relationship to a matter at issue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Relative to specific provisions of such Restatement (Second) Conflicts of Laws (excluding the comments thereto, such having been disregarded by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code unless provided otherwise herein):
         </p>
         <p>
          § 268. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code: is in accord with subsections (1) and (2)(a); but rejects subsection (2)(b) due to such code’s preference for certainty and such code’s provision that in the absence of a state jurisdiction provision, place of execution, and not “the state which the testator or settlor would probably have desired to be applicable,” controls.
         </p>
         <p>
          § 269. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code: is in accord with clause (a), but only as such clause applies to this state or another state and not to any foreign country; rejects the provisions of clause (b) to the extent they conflict with such code; and specifically rejects all references in clause (b) to “public policy of the state of the testator’s domicile at death,” as well as to references requiring that a state jurisdiction provision have a “substantial relation to the trust,” the necessary nexus for a state jurisdiction provision being provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          § 270. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code expressly rejects the concept in clause (a) that a state designated in a state jurisdiction provision need have “a substantial relation to the trust,” the necessary nexus for a state jurisdiction provision being provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>. Moreover, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code expressly rejects the requirement in clause (a) that application of the law of the state designated in a state jurisdiction provision “not violate a strong public policy of the state with which, as to the matter at issue, the trust has is most significant relationship.” Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code neither the public policy of, nor the relationship of a trust to, another state has any impact on a trust having a state jurisdiction provision. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects dependence in clause (b) on the “local law of the state with which, as to the matter at issue, the trust has its most significant relation-ship,” a trust’s validity in cases covered by § 270(b) being determined by the laws of the jurisdiction where the trust was executed pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107ol1c" target="_self">35-15-107(c)</a></cite>. Finally, no public policy of, nor the relationship of a trust to, any foreign country is relevant under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          § 271. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is generally in accord with clause (a), but would strike from such clause the words “as to matters which can be controlled by the terms of the trust,” all matters of administration being subject to the law of the jurisdiction designated in a state jurisdiction provision under such code. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects clause (b) to the extent such clause provides that, absent a state jurisdiction provision, administration is controlled by any law other than that of the state in which the trust is being principally administered.
         </p>
         <p>
          § 272. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is generally in accord with clause (a), but would strike from such clause the words “as to matters which can be controlled by the terms of the trust,” all matters of administration being subject to the law of the jurisdiction designated in a state jurisdiction provision under such code. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects clause (b) to the extent such clause provides that, absent a state jurisdiction provision, administration is controlled by any law other than that of the state in which the trust is being principally administered.
         </p>
         <p>
          § 273. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code: is generally in accord with clause (a), but only as it applies to this state or another state and not to any foreign country; rejects the provisions of clause (b) to the extent they conflict with such code; and in cases of trusts not containing a state jurisdiction provision providing for such trust’s place of administration, specifically rejects all references in clause (b) to “the local law of the state to which the administration of the trust is most substantially related,” the place of a trust’s administration being provided for in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107ol1c" target="_self">35-15-107(c)</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          § 274. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code rejects all references in this section relative to “the strong public policy of the testator’s domicil at death.” Notwithstanding any provisions of § 274, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code confirms that a power of appointment: is not a property interest nor a beneficial interest; is held by the person to whom such power has been given, and not by a settler in that person’s capacity as settler; may not be judicially foreclosed; is not reachable by a creditor or assignee at the trust level; and the fact a beneficiary holds a power of appointment is not indicative or determinative of whether a settlor or beneficiary has dominion and control over a trust. To the extent § 274 of such Restatement is in conflict with the immediately preceding sentence, such § 274 is expressly rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          When a state jurisdiction provision designates that Tennessee law controls, Tennessee obtains jurisdiction over the trust and its law controls the validity, construction and administration of a trust (or any part thereof, as a settlor desires). In the absence of such a state jurisdiction provision, the laws of the jurisdiction where the trust was executed determine its validity and the laws of descent, while the laws of the trust’s principal place of administration determine its administration.
         </p>
         <p>
          Additionally, when a state jurisdiction provision designates that Tennessee law controls, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code explicitly provides that no foreign country has any jurisdiction, power or effect over that trust or any disposition under it. Moreover, in such case no foreign country has any power to set the trust or any of its provisions aside, or attempt to do so. Therefore, a foreign country’s failure to recognize trusts, or the fact a trust avoids a foreign country’s laws granting rights to some person relative to property in the trust; such rights being based on a personal relationship to a settlor of, a party to, or beneficiary of, the trust; are irrelevant and are not respected by Tennessee. Any laws of a foreign country relative to forced heirship, legitime, forced share or similar rights are rejected and are unenforceable under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. No judgment of any foreign country will be recognized or enforced by Tennessee to the extent such judgment concerns a trust having a state jurisdiction provision designating the law of Tennessee as controlling.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “subsection” or “subdivision” means such portion of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107" target="_self">35-15-107</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (a) defines a state jurisdiction provision and provides that, when such is included in a trust instrument, it controls validity, construction and administration of that trust.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (b) provides that when a state jurisdiction provision designates that the law of Tennessee controls:
         </p>
         <p>
          Tennessee and its courts have jurisdiction over the trust, even if such trust was created in a foreign jurisdiction.
         </p>
         <p>
          The validity, construction and administration of the trust is determined by the laws of Tennessee. Such laws control items including but not limited to: settlor’s capacity; powers and duties of all fiduciaries; appointment and removal of all fiduciaries; the existence, validity and extent of powers conferred on any fiduciary or retained by a settlor.
         </p>
         <p>
          No law of a foreign country has any force or effect on the trust, regardless of whether such country does or does not recognize the concept of a trust.
         </p>
         <p>
          Tennessee does not in any way recognize any laws of a foreign country granting rights to some person relative to property in the trust; including any rights based on a personal relationship to a settlor of, a party to, or beneficiary of, the trust. Therefore, any laws of a foreign country relative to forced heirship, legitime, forced share or similar rights are rejected and are unenforceable.
         </p>
         <p>
          Relative to any realty or immovable property physically in Tennessee and relative to any personal or movable property regardless of the location of such, foreign law has no force or effect on the trust and such property.
         </p>
         <p>
          No judgment or other holding of any adjudicative body of a foreign country will be recognized, nor will such be enforced or otherwise be granted relief.
         </p>
         <p>
          Should any action be brought against any fiduciary of a trust by any adjudicative body of a foreign country under which action such adjudicative body declines to apply the law of Tennessee to such trust or any provision or interest under such trust, applicable fiduciaries of such trust shall by operation of law immediately cease being such fiduciary and have no further power other than to convey trust property to a successor fiduciary. Such successor fiduciary can be named in the trust instrument, in absence of such will be appointed to office under a statutorily provided mechanism. This provision thwarts a foreign country from obtaining or attempting to obtain jurisdiction over the trust, as well as over any trust property other than immovable property physically present in such foreign country.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (c) provides for fallback governing law in the absence of a state jurisdiction provision. Such fallback governing law is clear, concise and concrete. Moreover, it is in no way dependent on the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship to the matter at issue. For all these reasons, it provides certainty.
         </p>
         <p>
          Regarding the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition. According to ULC – NCCUSL, Uniform Trust Code section 107 (made irrelevant by the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code) is consistent with and was partially based on the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition, signed on July 1, 1985. Despite such section of the Uniform Trust Code being irrelevant, it is important to note that the United States has not (as of May 2013) ratified such convention. Therefore, such convention has no force and effect on the United States, any state or this state (as such terms are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>). To the extent such convention is in conflict with the Tennessee trust statutes or Tennessee law in general, Tennessee law controls or absence of Tennessee law, the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106" target="_self">35-15-106</a></cite> and the comments thereunder control.

        If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

         Section Comment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code substantially rewrote the previous subsection (a) of this section, leaving the former version inoperative as provided in the enacting and transitional language of Section 55, Pub. Act. 2013, Pub. Ch. 390, 108th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Tenn., 2013). Such amendment also made section 107(a) of the Uniform Trust Code, as well as the comments thereunder, irrelevant to the current T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows any person having the requisite nexus with a jurisdiction to choose that jurisdiction’s law as controlling over a trust. Such requisite nexus is provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108ol1a" target="_self">35-15-108(a)</a></cite> and is defined in the broadest and most flexible terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Relative to a state jurisdiction provision, designating the principal place of administration should be distinguished from designating the law to determine the meaning and effect of the trust's terms. A settlor is free in a state jurisdiction provision to designate one jurisdiction as the principal place of administration and another to govern the meaning and effect of the trust's provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, to the extent not otherwise provided in a state jurisdiction provision and to the greatest extent possible, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108ol1b" target="_self">35-15-108(b)</a></cite> provides that the principal place of administration of a trust is Tennessee if all or part of such administration takes place in Tennessee.
        </p>
        <p>
         Locating a trust’s principal place of administration may also be important for other matters, such as payment of state income tax. The fixing of a trust's principal place of administration will also determine where the trustee and beneficiaries have consented to suit under T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107" target="_self">35-15-107</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-202" target="_self">35-15-202</a></cite>, as well as the rules for locating venue under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-204" target="_self">35-15-204</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
         Notwithstanding the above, the remainder of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite> provides that a trustee has a continuing duty to administer the trust in a jurisdiction that is appropriate. Moreover, such section provides a relatively simple procedure by which the trustee (or appropriate fiduciary) of a trust may transfer its principal place of administration to another jurisdiction within or without the United States. Use of this procedure is more readily available under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code than under the Uniform Trust Code. Under the latter, the power to so transfer can be blocked by the objection of a single qualified beneficiary. On the contrary, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code requires that a majority of the qualified beneficiaries object to such transfer or it will proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “subsection” or “subdivision” means such portion of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (a) provides a non-exclusive list of factors containing the requisite nexus with a jurisdiction to choose that jurisdiction’s law as controlling over a trust. Having chosen such jurisdiction, a settlor can then designate that juris-diction law control law by including a state jurisdiction provision in a trust per T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107" target="_self">35-15-107</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b) provides that unless expressly specified otherwise in a trust instrument or by court order, Tennessee law governs the administration of a trust while such trust is administered in this state. Without precluding other means to establish that a trust is being administered in this state, the occurrence in Tennessee of any of the factors listed in subsection (a) causes the trust to be administered in Tennessee.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c) provides that a trustee is under a continuing duty to administer the trust at a place appropriate to its purposes, its administration, and the interests of the beneficiaries. “Interests of the beneficiaries,” defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, means the beneficial interests provided in the terms of the trust. Ordinarily, absent a substantial change or circumstances, the trustee may assume that the original place of administration is also the appropriate place of administration. The duty to administer the trust at an appropriate place may also dictate that the trustee not move the trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsections (d)-(g) provide a procedure for changing the principal place of administration to another state or country. Such changes are often beneficial. A change may be desirable for any number of reasons, the following of which is a non-exhaustive list: to secure a lower state income tax rate; to obtain more favorable creditor protection; to extend any applicable rule against perpetuities; to avoid any prohibition on trust accumulations; to obtain or maintain the traditional common law distinction among mandatory, support and discretionary interests and trusts; to avoid any laws granting rights to some person relative to property in the trust; such rights being based on a personal relationship to a settlor of, a party to, or beneficiary of, the trust (e.g., forced heirship); because of relocation of the trustee or beneficiaries; the appointment of a new trustee; or a change in the location of the trust investments. The procedure for transfer specified in this section applies only in the absence of a contrary provision in the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. To facilitate transfer in the typical case, where there is general concurrence that a transfer is either desirable or is at least not harmful, a transfer can be accomplished without court approval unless a majority of qualified beneficiary objects. To allow the qualified beneficiaries described in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> sufficient time to review a proposed transfer, the trustee must give such qualified beneficiaries at least 60 days prior notice of the transfer. Notice must be given not only to qualified beneficiaries as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> but also to those granted the rights of qualified beneficiaries under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite>. To assure that those receiving notice have sufficient information upon which to make a decision, minimum contents of the notice are specified. If a majority of the qualified beneficiary described in T.C.A. § 35-15-103 objects, a trustee wishing to proceed with the transfer must seek court approval.
        </p>
        <p>
         In connection with a transfer of the principal place of administration, the trustee may transfer some or all of the trust property to a new trustee located outside of this state. The appointment of a new trustee may also be essential if the current trustee is ineligible to administer the trust in the new jurisdiction. Subsection (g) clarifies that the appointment of the new trustee must comply with the provisions on appointment of successor trustees as provided in the terms of the trust or under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite>. Absent an order of succession in the terms of the trust, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> contains separate procedures for appointment of a successor trustee of a noncharitable trust and for appointment of a successor trustee of a charitable trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         While transfer of the principal place of administration will normally change the governing law with respect to administrative matters, a transfer does not normally alter the controlling law with respect to the validity of the trust and the construction of its dispositive provisions. See  5A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 615 (4th ed. 1989) as well as 7 A. W. Scott, W. F. Fratcher & M. L. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on Trusts  § 45.5.3.2 (5th ed. 2010).

        Section Comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “beneficiary” includes only those who hold beneficial interests in the trust. Because a charitable trust is not created to benefit ascertainable beneficiaries but to benefit the community at large (See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-405ol1a" target="_self">35-15-405(a)</a></cite>), persons receiving distributions from a charitable trust are not beneficiaries as that term is defined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, certain persons do have an interest in seeing that a charitable trust is enforced. Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite>, such persons include this state’s attorney general and certain charitable organizations expressly designated to receive distributions under the terms of the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “subsection” or “subdivision” means such portion of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (a), charitable organizations expressly designated in the terms of the trust to receive distributions and that would qualify as a qualified beneficiary were the trust noncharitable are granted the rights of qualified beneficiaries under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code despite not being beneficiaries under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Because the charitable organization must be expressly named in the terms of the trust and must be designated to receive distributions, excluded are organizations that might receive distributions in the trustee’s discretion even though not expressly mentioned in the trust’s terms. Requiring that the organization have an interest similar to that of a beneficiary of a private trust also denies the rights of a qualified beneficiary to organizations holding more remote interests. Finally, requiring that only such charitable organizations that would qualify as a qualified beneficiary were the trust noncharitable are granted the rights of qualified beneficiaries also precludes such organizations from being qualified beneficiaries if they an ultimate beneficiary or potential ultimate beneficiary. For further discussion of the definition of “qualified beneficiary” and “ultimate beneficiary” see § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.

        Section Comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code recognizes that a court may intervene in the administration of a trust to the extent its jurisdiction is invoked by interested persons or otherwise provided by law See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-201" target="_self">35-15-201</a></cite>), resolution of disputes by nonjudicial means is encouraged. This section facilitates the making of such agreements by giving them the same effect as if approved by the court. To achieve such certainty, however, subsection (b) requires that the nonjudicial settlement must contain terms and conditions that a court could properly approve. Under this section, a nonjudicial settlement cannot be used to produce a result not authorized by law, such as to terminate a trust in an impermissible manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trusts ordinarily have beneficiaries who are minors, incapacitated, unborn or unascertained. Because such beneficiaries cannot signify their consent to an agreement, binding settlements can ordinarily be achieved only through the application of doctrines such as virtual representation or appointment of a guardian ad litem, doctrines traditionally available only in the case of judicial settlements. The effect of this section and the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code more generally is to allow for such binding representation even if the agreement is not submitted for approval to a court. For the rules on representation, including appointments of representatives by the court to approve particular settlements, see title 35, part 3.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Uniform Trust Code, all “interested persons” (as defined in section 111(a) thereof) were required to enter into a nonjudicial settlement in order for it to be binding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code “the trustee and qualified beneficiaries” are the parties necessary to enter into and conclude a nonjudicial settlement agreement. Qualified beneficiary is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires the agreement of trustee and qualified beneficiaries to effectuate a nonjudicial settlement agreement in order to avoid the required involvement of potential (or even unborn) beneficiaries whose interests are remote and who previously may have required the appointment of a representative by the court or otherwise obtaining representation virtually, thus limiting the objectives of having, as well as the access to, a nonjudicial settlement agreement process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though broader then the similar list in the Uniform Trust Code, the items enumerated in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111ol1c" target="_self">35-15-111(c)</a></cite> regarding matters to which a nonjudicial settlement may pertain are still nonexclusive. Other matters which may be made the subject of a nonjudicial settlement are discussed in the General Comment to part 3 contained at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite>. The fact that the trustee and beneficiaries may resolve a matter nonjudicially does not mean that beneficiary approval is required. For example, a trustee may resign pursuant to section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite> solely by giving notice to the qualified beneficiaries, a living settlor, and any cotrustees. But a nonjudicial settlement between the trustee and beneficiaries will frequently prove helpful in working out the terms of the resignation.

        Section Comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is patterned after Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 25(2) and comment e (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, unlike the Restatement, the section fully and generally applies to irrevocable, as well as revocable, trusts unless specifically provided otherwise herein. Moreover, a general reference to the nature, use or purpose of either such type of trust does not imply inapplicability of this section to the other of such types of trusts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The revocable trust is used primarily as a will substitute, with its key provision being the determination of the per-sons to receive the trust property upon the settlor’s death. Given this functional equivalence between the revocable trust and a will, the rules for interpreting the disposition of property at death should be the same whether the individual has chosen a will or revocable trust as the individual’s primary estate planning instrument. Over the years, the legislatures of the states and the courts have developed a series of rules of construction reflecting the legislative or judicial understanding of how the average testator would wish to dispose of property in cases where the will is silent or insufficiently clear. Few legislatures have yet to extend these rules of construction to revocable trusts, and even fewer to irrevocable trusts, although a number of courts have done so as a matter of judicial construction. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 25 , Reporter's Notes to cmt. d and e (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not attempt to prescribe the exact rules to be applied to trusts but instead adopts the philosophy that the rules applicable to trusts generally should be the same as the rules applicable to wills, whatever those rules might be.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules of construction are not the same as constructional preferences. A constructional preference is general in nature, providing general guidance for resolving a wide variety of ambiguities. An example is a preference for a construction that results in a complete disposition and avoid illegality. Rules of construction, on the other hand, are specific in nature, providing guidance for resolving specific situations or construing specific terms. Unlike a constructional preference, a rule of construction, when applicable, can lead to only one result. See  Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 11.3 and cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995).
       </p>

        Rules of construction attribute intention to individual donors based on assumptions of common intention. Rules of construction are found both in enacted statutes and in judicial decisions. Rules of construction can involve the meaning to be given to particular language in the document, such as the meaning to be given to “heirs” or “issue.” Rules of construction also address situations the donor failed to anticipate. These include but are not limited to the following:
       </p>
       <p>
        The required time period for surviving the settlor provided for in T.C.A. Section 31-3-120;
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to anticipate the predecease of a beneficiary;
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure to specify the source from which expenses are to be paid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules of construction can also concern assumptions as to how a donor would have revised donative documents in light of certain events occurring after execution. These include but are not limited to the following:
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules dealing with whether a specific devisee will receive a substitute gift if the subject matter of the devise is disposed of during the settlor’s lifetime; and
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.32.html#t32c01s32-1-202" target="_blank">32-1-202</a></cite> prescribing the effect of a divorce on bequests made to a former spouse pursuant to a trust executed during the marriage to such spouse. However, such provisions of such section will only apply to a trust with respect to which the settlor retained a power of revocation, a power to revest all the assets of the trust in such settlor or a power to change the beneficiaries of the trust.

        </p>
        <p>
         This part, this general comment thereto and the other section comments under such part are subject to any rules or restrictions on jurisdiction or venue provided for directly or indirectly in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-107" target="_self">35-15-107</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>, together with the comments to the latter two such sections. Such latter two sections and their comments are controlling. This includes, but is not limited to, the preclusion of any adjudicative body of a foreign country obtaining jurisdiction or venue of a trust, any of its fiduciaries or any of its trustees when such trust contains a state jurisdiction provision designating the law of a jurisdiction other than such foreign country.
        </p>
        <p>
         This part addresses selected issues involving judicial proceedings concerning trusts, particularly trusts with contacts in more than one state or country. This part is not intended to provide comprehensive coverage of court jurisdiction or procedure with respect to trusts. These issues are better addressed elsewhere, for example in the state's rules of civil procedure or as provided by court rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-201" target="_self">35-15-201</a></cite> makes clear that the jurisdiction of the court is available as invoked by interested persons or as otherwise provided by law. Proceedings involving the administration of a trust normally will be brought in the court at the trust’s principal place of administration. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-202" target="_self">35-15-202</a></cite> provides that the trustee and beneficiaries are deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of the court at the principal place of administration as to any matter relating to the trust. T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-203" target="_self">35-15-203</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-204" target="_self">35-15-204</a></cite> contain provisions relating to subject matter jurisdiction and venue.
        </p>
        <p>
         Section Comment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-201" target="_self">35-15-201</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code encourages the resolution of disputes without resort to the courts by providing such options as the nonjudicial settlement authorized by section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111" target="_self">35-15-111</a></cite>, the court is always available to the extent its jurisdiction is invoked by interested persons. The jurisdiction of the court with respect to trust matters is inherent and historical and also includes the ability to act on its own initiative, to appoint a special master to investigate the facts of a case, and to provide a trustee with instructions even in the absence of an actual dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrary to the trust statutes in some states, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not create a system of routine or mandatory court supervision. While subsection (b) authorizes a court to direct that a particular trust be subject to continuing court supervision, the court's intervention will normally be confined to the particular matter brought before it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (c) makes clear that the court’s jurisdiction may be invoked even absent an actual dispute. Traditionally, courts in equity have heard petitions for instructions and have issued declaratory judgments if there is a reasonable doubt as to the extent of the trustee’s powers or duties. The court will not ordinarily instruct trustees on how to exercise discretion, however. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 187 , 259 (1959). Moreover, in furtherance of the rule of Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 187 (1959), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite> provides that the court may only exercise jurisdiction in limited circumstances to review a trustee’s discretion or force a distribution. Other than as specifically provided otherwise in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, this section does not limit the court’s equity jurisdiction. Beyond mentioning petitions for instructions and actions to declare rights, subsection (c) does not attempt to list the types of judicial proceedings involving trust administration that might be brought by a trustee or beneficiary.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to ULC – NCCUSL, such an effort is made in California Probate Code § 17200 . Further according to ULC – NCCUSL, excluding matters not germane to the Uniform Trust Code, the California statute lists the following as items relating to the “internal affairs” of a trust: determining questions of construction; determining the existence or nonexistence of any immunity, power, privilege, duty, or right; determining the validity of a trust provision; ascertaining beneficiaries and determining to whom property will pass upon final or partial termination of the trust; settling accounts and passing upon the acts of a trustee, including the exercise of discretionary powers (such jurisdiction being limited by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite>); instructing the trustee; compelling the trustee to report information about the trust or account to the beneficiary; granting powers to the trustee; fixing or allowing payment of the trustee’s compensation or reviewing the reasonableness of the compensation; appointing or removing a trustee; accepting the resignation of a trustee; compelling redress of a breach of trust by any available remedy; approving or directing the modification or termination of a trust; approving or directing the combination or division of trusts; and authorizing or directing transfer of a trust or trust property to or from another jurisdiction. In light of this paragraph being other law as such is defined in the comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite>, such is not controlling to the extent it is in conflict with the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee trust statutes or Tennessee law in general.

        </p>
        <p>
         This section clarifies that the courts of the principal place of administration have jurisdiction to enter orders relating to the trust that will be binding on both the trustee and beneficiaries. Consent to jurisdiction does not dispense with any required notice, however. With respect to jurisdiction over a beneficiary, the Comment to Uniform Probate Code § 7-103, upon which portions of this section are based, is instructive:
        </p>
        <p>
         It also seems reasonable to require beneficiaries to go to the seat of the trust when litigation has been instituted there concerning a trust in which they claim beneficial interests, much as the rights of shareholders of a corporation can be determined at a corporate seat. The settlor has indicated a principal place of administration by its selection of a trustee or otherwise, and it is reasonable to subject rights under the trust to the jurisdiction of the Court where the trust is properly administered.
        </p>
        <p>
         The jurisdiction conferred over the trustee and beneficiaries by this section does not preclude jurisdiction by courts elsewhere on some other basis. Furthermore, the fact that the courts in a new state acquire jurisdiction under this section following a change in a trust’s principal place of administration does not necessarily mean that the courts of the former principal place of administration lose jurisdiction, particularly as to matters involving events occurring prior to the transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
         The jurisdiction conferred by this section is limited. Pursuant to subsection (b), until a distribution is made, jurisdiction over a beneficiary is limited to the beneficiary’s beneficial interests in the trust. Personal jurisdiction over a beneficiary is conferred only upon the making of a distribution. Subsection (b) also gives the court jurisdiction over other recipients of distributions. This would include individuals who receive distributions in the mistaken belief they are beneficiaries.

         While the trustees'  transfer of the situs of a trust from Tennessee to Mississippi in 1999 was invalid because the trustees did not obtain court approval as required by former T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c01s35-1-122ol1repealed" target="_self">35-1-122 (repealed)</a></cite>, and under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-204ol1a" target="_self">35-15-204(a)</a></cite>, the state of Tennessee retained jurisdiction over the trust without interruption, the ruling that the ineffective transfer resulted in voiding all transactions after the attempted transfer was inappropriate.

         If the trustee resigns, is removed, or upon the full or partial termination of the trust, a qualified beneficiary or successor trustee may petition the court to require the trustee transferring or distributing the trust to appear before the court for a final accounting. However, a successor trustee shall not have any obligation to petition the court to require the final accounting. The trustee transferring or distributing the trust may also petition the court to approve a final accounting relieving the trustee from liability for the period of its administration. The final accounting period shall begin from the latest of:

         Upon review of the trustee's final accounting and after considering any objections thereto and any evidence presented, the court may approve the final accounting or enter judgment granting appropriate relief.

          General Comment.
         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of this part in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this part is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          Representation under this part is allowed except to the extent there is a material  conflict of interest with respect to the particular matter or dispute. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverges from the Uniform Trust Code in that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires that there be no material conflict of interest (as opposed to requiring no conflict of interest) between the one representing and one represented. Therefore, it is not necessary that no conflict, whatsoever, exist in order to avail oneself of representation, only that no material conflict exist. This divergence from the Uniform Trust Code makes representation and virtual representation available in far more cases under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, thereby adding flexibility.
         </p>
         <p>
          This part deals with representation of beneficiaries, both representation by fiduciaries (personal representatives, trustees, guardians, and conservators) and in some cases by their ancestors, as well as what is known as virtual representation. Representation is a topic not adequately addressed under the trust law of most states. Representation is addressed in the Restatement (First) of Property §§ 180 -186 (1936), but the coverage of this part is more complete. Notwithstanding, the preceding reference to such restatement, in light of the divergence of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in this area, to the extent the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is contra to such restatement, such restatement is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

          T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> is the introductory section, laying out the scope of the part. The representation principles of this part have numerous applications under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Such representation principles of this part apply in numerous circumstances, including but not limited to: for purposes of settlement of disputes, whether by a court or nonjudicially; for the giving of required notices; and for the giving of consents to certain actions.
         </p>
         <p>
          T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-302" target="_self">35-15-302</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> cover the different types of representation. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-302" target="_self">35-15-302</a></cite> deals with representation by the holder of a general testamentary power of appointment. (Revocable trusts and presently exercisable general powers of appointment are covered by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>, which grant the settlor or holder of the power all rights of the beneficiaries or persons whose interests are subject to the power). T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite> deals with representation by a fiduciary, whether of an estate, trust, conservatorship, or guardianship. The section also allows a person without a material conflict of interest to represent and bind a minor or unborn descendant. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite> grants broader powers of representation than does Uniform Trust Code section 303, as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the Uniform Trust Code, only a “parent” (as opposed to a “person”) can represent only that parent’s minor or unborn “child” (as opposed to that person’s minor or unborn “descendant”).
         </p>
         <p>
          T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite> (unlike the Uniform Trust Code) also allows a settlor or the beneficiaries to designate a person to represent such beneficiaries.
         </p>
         <p>
          T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-304" target="_self">35-15-304</a></cite> is the virtual representation provision. It provides for representation of and the giving of a binding consent by another person having a substantially identical interest with respect to the particular issue. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> authorizes the court to appoint a representative to represent the interests of unrepresented persons or persons for whom the court concludes the other available representation might be inadequate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of this part are subject to modification in the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. Settlors are free to specify their own methods for providing substituted notice and obtaining substituted consent. Moreover, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s robust provisions for trust advisors and trust protectors further the methods for providing such notice and obtaining such consent.

          Section Comment.

         <p>
          Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          This section is general and introductory, laying out the scope of the part.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (a) validates substitute notice to a person who may represent and bind another person as provided in the succeeding sections of this part. Notice to the substitute has the same effect as if given directly to the other person. Subsection (a) does not apply to notice of a judicial proceeding. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-109" target="_self">35-15-109</a></cite>, notice of a judicial proceeding must be given as provided in the applicable rules of civil procedure, which may require that notice not only be given to the representative but also to the person represented. Subsection (a) may be used to facilitate the giving of notice to the requisite beneficiaries in many circumstances, including but not limited to: of a proposed transfer of principal place of administration under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>; of a proposed trust combination or division under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>; of a temporary assumption of duties without accepting trusteeship directly by a trustee, or the same by a trust advisor or trust protector indirectly, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite>; of a trustee’s resignation directly, or the same by a trust advisor or trust protector indirectly,  under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite>; and of a trustee’s report under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (b) deals with the effect of a consent, whether by actual or virtual representation. Subsection (b) may be used to facilitate consent of the requisite beneficiaries in many circumstances, including but not limited to: to modification or termination of a trust under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>;  agreement of the requisite beneficiaries on appointment of a successor trustee of a noncharitable trust T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> (or of a trust advisor or trust protector under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-713" target="_self">35-15-713</a></cite>); and a beneficiary’s consent to or release or affirmance of the actions of a trustee T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>. A consent by a representative bars a later objection by the person represented, but a consent is not binding if the person represented raises an objection prior to the date the consent would otherwise become effective. The possibility that a beneficiary might object to a consent given on the beneficiary’s behalf will not be germane in many cases because the person represented will be unborn or unascertained. However, the representation principles of this part will sometimes apply to adult and competent beneficiaries. For example, while the trustee of a revocable trust entitled to a pourover devise has authority under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite> to approve the personal representative’s account on behalf of the trust beneficiaries, such consent would not be binding on a trust beneficiary who registers an objection.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (c) implements the policy of T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite> requiring express authority in the power of attorney or approval of court before the settlor’s agent, conservator or guardian may consent on behalf of the settlor to the termination or revocation of the settlor’s revocable trust.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subsection (d) is a tax-savings provision. Because of the ability of a settlor under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> to represent and bind a beneficiary with respect to a termination or modification of an irrevocable trust, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411ol1a" target="_self">35-15-411(a)</a></cite> might result in inclusion of the trust in the settlor’s gross estate. Subsection (d) eliminates the possibility of such representation.

          Typically, the holder of a general testamentary power of appointment is also a life income beneficiary of the trust, oftentimes of a trust intended to qualify for the federal estate tax marital deduction. See I.R.C. § 2056(b)(5) [26 U.S.C. 2056 (b)(5)]. Without the exception for material conflict of interest, the holder of the power could act in a way that could enhance the holder’s income interests to the detriment of the appointees or takers in default, whoever they may be (taking such action would likely rise to the level of the creation of a conflict of interest that was material).
         </p>
         <p>
          In determining whether the representative has a material conflict with the person sought to be represented, the following may be indicia of such conflict:
         </p>
         <p>
          The action to be approved may cause the trustee or co-trustee to operate the trust in a manner that would generally be considered imprudent;
         </p>
         <p>
          The action to be approved if submitted to a court would generally not be approved; and
         </p>
         <p>
          The action to be approved if subject to review by a court appointed guardian ad litem, would not generally be recommended for approval;
         </p>
         <p>
          All of the above to be determined under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>, which diverges significantly from the Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          If any of these or other indicia of a material conflict exists, the representative seeking to exercise a representative position has the burden to demonstrate that notwithstanding the indicia of a material conflict, the proposed action is in the best interest of the represented beneficiary.

          Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite>.
         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          Representation under this section is allowed except to the extent there is a material  conflict of interest with respect to the particular matter or dispute. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverges from the Uniform Trust Code in that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires that there be no material conflict of interest (as opposed to requiring no conflict of interest) between the one representing and one represented. Therefore, it is not necessary that no conflict, whatsoever, exist in order to avail oneself of representation, only that no material conflict exist. This divergence from the Uniform Trust Code makes representation and virtual representation available in far more cases under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, thereby adding flexibility.
         </p>
         <p>
          This section allows for representation of persons by their fiduciaries (conservators, guardians, agents, trustees, and personal representatives), a principle that has long been part of the law. Subdivision (6) allows a person to represent his or her descendant. This includes the person’s child, as under the Uniform Trust Code, but unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code extends this ability to the representation of other descendants as well. Note that this section is not limited to representation of beneficiaries. It also applies to representation of the settlor. Representation is not available if the fiduciary or parent is in a material conflict position with respect to the particular matter or dispute, however. A typical material conflict could exist in cases where the fiduciary or parent seeking to represent the beneficiary is either the trustee or holds an adverse beneficial interest.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subdivision (2) authorizes a guardian to bind and represent a ward if a conservator of the ward’s estate has not been appointed. Granting a guardian authority to represent the ward with respect to interests in the trust can avoid the need to seek appointment of a conservator. This grant of authority to act with respect to the ward’s trust interest may broaden the authority of a guardian. Under the Tennessee law, a “conservator” is appointed by the court to manage the ward’s property and to make decisions with respect to a ward’s personal affairs. The reference to a “guardian” was left in the statute because Tennessee does have provisions for the appointment of Veterans guardians which guardians speak for adult wards.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subdivision (3) authorizes an agent to represent a principal only to the extent the agent has authority to act with respect to the particular question or dispute. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>, an agent may represent a settlor with respect to the amendment, revocation or termination of a revocable trust only to the extent this authority is expressly granted either in the trust or the power. Otherwise, depending on the particular question or dispute, a general grant of authority in the power may be sufficient to confer the necessary authority.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subdivisions (7) and (8) deal with situation where a settlor or one or more beneficiaries appoint a trust advisor, trust protector or other person to exercise certain powers on behalf of a beneficiary.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subdivisions (7) and (8) clarify that such persons may designate a person or persons to represent beneficiaries; in the case of the settlor, in the trust instrument, and in the case of all such person provided for in subdivisions (7) and (8), in a separate written document that is delivered to the trustee. A written designation of a representative by a settler or a beneficiary may occur subsequent to the execution of the trust instrument. If the designated representative is an individual, the settlor would be wise to designate a successor or establish a procedure for selecting a successor. The designated representative should be given specific duties that might include receipt of any required notice under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813ol1a" target="_self">35-15-813 (a)</a></cite> or (b) or under any other section of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          In all cases regarding representation, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires that no material conflict of interest exist between the person representing and the person represented.

         <p>
          In determining whether the representative has a material conflict with the person sought to be represented, the following may be indicia of such conflict:

         <p>
          Representation under this section is allowed except to the extent there is a material  conflict of interest with respect to the particular matter or dispute. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverges from the Uniform Trust Code in that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires that there be no material conflict of interest (as opposed to requiring no conflict of interest) between the one representing and one represented. Therefore, it is not necessary that no conflict, whatsoever, exist in order to avail oneself of representation, only that no material conflict exist. This divergence from the Uniform Trust Code makes representation and virtual representation available in far more cases under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, thereby adding flexibility.
         </p>
         <p>
          This section authorizes a person with a substantially identically interest with respect to a particular question or dispute to represent and bind an otherwise unrepresented minor, incapacitated or unborn individual, or person whose location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable. This section is derived from section 1-403(2)(iii) of the Uniform Probate Code, but with several modifications. Unlike the UPC, this section does not expressly require that the representation be adequate. Furthermore, this section extends the doctrine of virtual representation to representation of minors and incapacitated individuals. Finally, this section does not apply to the extent there is a material conflict of interest between the representative and the person represented.
         </p>
         <p>
          Restatement (First) of Property §§ 181  and 185 (1936) provide that virtual representation is inapplicable if the interest represented was not sufficiently protected. Representation is deemed sufficiently protective as long as it does not appear that the representative acted in hostility to the interest of the person represented. Restatement (First) of Property § 185  (1936). Evidence of inactivity or lack of skill is material only to the extent it establishes such hostility. Restatement (First) of Property § 185  cmt. b (1936). To the extent the fact that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only re-quires that no material conflict of interest exist between the person representing and the person represented is contra with the views of such restatement, such restatement is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          Typically, the interests of the representative and the person represented will be identical. A common example would be a trust providing for distribution to the settlor’s children as a class, with an adult child being able to represent the interests of children who are either minors or unborn. Exact identity of interests is not required, only substantial identity with respect to the particular question or dispute. Whether such identity is present may depend on the nature of the interest. For example, a presumptive remaindermen may be able to represent alternative remaindermen with respect to approval of a trustee’s report but not with respect to interpretation of the remainder provision or termination of the trust. Even if the beneficial interests of the representative and person represented are identical, representation is not allowed in the event of material conflict of interest. The representative may have interests outside of the trust that are adverse to the interest of the person represented, such as a prior relationship with the trustee or other beneficiaries. See Restatement (First) of Property § 185  cmt. d (1936). Relative to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s requirement of materiality regarding conflicts of interest and the effect such may have on the above expressed view of the restatement versus Tennessee law, see the immediately preceding paragraph.
         </p>
         <p>
          In all cases regarding representation, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires that no material conflict of interest exist between the person representing and the person represented.

          This section is derived from section 1-403(4) of the Uniform Probate Code. However, this section substitutes “representative” for “guardian ad litem” to signal that a representative under this Code serves a different role. Unlike a guardian ad litem, under this section a representative can be appointed to act with respect to a nonjudicial settlement or to receive a notice on a beneficiary’s behalf. Furthermore, in making decisions, a representative may consider general benefit accruing to living members of the family. The court may appoint a representative to act for a person even if the person could be represented under another section of this part.

           General Comment.
          </p>
          <p>
           The provisions of this chapter in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>, which specify the requirements for the creation of a trust, largely codify traditional doctrine, though arguably the net effect or these sections is to provide more flexibility regarding such creation.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite> specifies the methods by which trusts are created, that is, by transfer of property, self-declaration, exercise of a power of appointment or by a court pursuant to its statutory or equitable powers. Whatever method may have been employed, other requirements, including intention, capacity and, for certain types of trusts, an ascertainable beneficiary, also must be satisfied before a trust is created. These requirements are listed in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite>, which unlike the laws of certain states (e.g., Florida) do not require either a revocable or irrevocable trust with testamentary provisions be made with the formalities of a will.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-403" target="_self">35-15-403</a></cite> addresses the validity in the enacting jurisdiction of trusts created in other jurisdictions. A trust not created by will is validly created if its creation complied with the law of specified jurisdictions in which the settlor or trustee had the requisite contact.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> forbids trusts for illegal or impossible purposes, but unlike the Uniform Trust Code, does not require that a trust purpose “not be contrary to public policy.” Moreover, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> requires that a trust and its terms must be for the benefit of its beneficiaries and pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>, requires the “benefit of the beneficiaries to be determined solely considering how such interests “are defined in the terms of the trust.” This is designed to further enforcement of settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition, both of which are overriding goals of the Tennessee trust statutes.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-405" target="_self">35-15-405</a></cite> recites the permitted purposes of a charitable trust. As under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite>, there is no prohibition against purposes contrary to public policy. Moreover, when exercising cy pres under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite>, the court is required to fulfill as nearly as possible the settlor’s charitable intent (as such were defined in the terms of the trust).
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-406" target="_self">35-15-406</a></cite> lists some of the grounds for contesting a trust. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-407" target="_self">35-15-407</a></cite> validates oral trusts.
          </p>
          <p>
           The remaining sections address what are often referred to as “honorary” (sometimes called “purpose”) trusts. Such trusts are valid and enforceable under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> covers a trust for the care of an animal and unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, such can last up to 90 years. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> allows creation of a trust for another noncharitable purpose (a “purpose” trust) for any valid non-charitable purpose. Again unlike the Uniform Trust Code, purpose trusts can last up to ninety (90) years under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, in the case of special types of trusts for which a perpetual purpose exists, such as maintenance of a cemetery lot, there is no time limit on such trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> — <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite> provide a series of interrelated rules on when a trust may be terminated or modified other than by its express terms. The overall objective of these sections is to enhance flexibility consistent with the principle that preserving the settlor’s intent as such is defined under the terms of the trust is paramount. This provisions covered by these sections in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that a trust advisor or trust protector may have the power to directly or indirectly modify a trust without being subject to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also note that, in cases where the existence or non-existence of a material purpose of a trust is relevant to the power to terminate or modify a trust, it is far easier for a purpose of a trust to rise to “material” status under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code than under the Uniform Trust Code. This is due to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1c" target="_self">35-15-105(c)</a></cite>, differences between the language to the section comment of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> relative to the definition of “spendthrift provision” and the comment to the definition of “spendthrift provision” in Uniform Trust Code section 103(16), as well as the omission of a provision similar to Uniform Trust Code section 411(c) and the comments thereunder in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> and the comments thereto. Notwithstanding the preceding portions of this paragraph, it is beneficial to state that Tennessee desires the flexibility provided by T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>. However under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code such flexibility must be balanced with the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s goals of assuring settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition.
          </p>
          <p>
           The methodology for termination or modification of a noncharitable irrevocable trust by consent under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is significantly different than such methodology under the Uniform Trust Code and readers are directed to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> and the section comment thereunder for those differences, as well as an explanation of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although the language in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite>, concerning modification or termination because of unanticipated circumstances or inability to administer trust effectively, is virtually identical to that contained in Uniform Trust Code section 412, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s view of the meaning and effect of such language diverges, in some cases significantly, from that of the Uniform Trust Code. Readers are directed to the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> for a discussion of such divergence and the reasoning behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Relative to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>, concerning modification or termination of uneconomic trusts, both the language and the intent of such diverges from that of the Uniform Trust Code section 414. Readers are directed to the language contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>, as well as to its section comment for a discussion of such divergence and the reasoning behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite> (concerning reformation to correct mistakes and modification to achieve settlor’s tax objectives), together with the section comments thereunder, generally follow Uniform Trust Code sections 415 and 416 and their comments. However, the section comments to both Tennessee sections stress the emphasis of interpreting to the extent possible, the interests of beneficiaries “as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust” as required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although containing somewhat different language, under both T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite> and Uniform Trust Code section 417, trusts may be combined or divided. However, see the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite> for reasons why additional language contained in T.C.A. § 35-15-417 provides more flexibility.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite>, a trustee or beneficiary has standing to petition the court with respect to the actions described in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> codifies and at the same time modifies the doctrine of cy pres, at least as such is applied in most states. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code authorizes the court to apply cy pres not only if the original means becomes impossible or unlawful but also if the means become impracticable obsolete or ineffective (rejecting the Uniform Trust Code language of “wasteful,” such believed to be too vague and subject to too broad of interpretation). T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> also creates a presumption of general charitable intent. Upon failure of the settlor’s original plan, the court cannot divert the trust property to a noncharity unless the terms of the trust expressly so provide. Again deviating from the Uniform Trust Code, when modifying or terminating a charitable trust in favor of a charitable interest, such must be done in a manner “that fulfills as nearly as possible the settlor’s intent and purposes.” Furthermore, absent a contrary provision in the terms of the trust, limits are placed on when a gift over to a noncharity can take effect upon failure or impracticality of the original charitable purpose. The gift over is effective only if, when the provision takes effect, the trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still living, or fewer than 21 years have elapsed since the date of the trust's creation. A reader is directed to the section comment to T.C.A. § 35-15-413 to determine the extent of such section’s deviation from Uniform Trust Code section 413 and the comments thereunder. In addition to the persons listed in the Uniform Trust Code, under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, a trust advisor or trust protector holding the power to do so may maintain an action to enforce a charitable trust or to apply cy pres.
          </p>
          <p>
           The requirements for a trust’s creation, such as the necessary level of capacity and the requirement that a trust have a legal purpose, are controlled by statute and common law, not by the settlor. But note that Tennessee has no requirement that a trust not have a purpose contrary to public policy or that a trustee need be required to act in good faith. Moreover, note the stricter standard by which a settlor’s intent relative to the interests for the benefit of beneficiaries is to be determined. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b1" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(1)</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite>. A settlor may not negate the court’s ability to modify or terminate a trust to the extent provided for in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite>. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b4" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(4)</a></cite>. However, a settlor is free to restrict or modify the trustee’s power to terminate an uneconomic trust as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>, and the trustee’s power to combine and divide trusts as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>.

           This section is based on Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 10 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 17  (1959). Under the methods specified for creating a trust in this section, a trust is not created until it receives property. For what constitutes an adequate property interest, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 40-41 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 74 -86 (1959). The property interest necessary to fund and create a trust need not be substantial. A revocable designation of the trustee as beneficiary of a life insurance policy or employee benefit plan has long been understood to be a property interest sufficient to create a trust. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> for the definition of “property.” Furthermore, the property interest need not be transferred contemporaneously with the signing of the trust instrument. A trust instrument signed during the settlor’s lifetime is not rendered invalid simply because the trust was not created until property was transferred to the trustee at a much later date, including by contract after the settlor’s death. A pourover devise to a previously unfunded trust is also valid and may constitute the property interest creating the trust. See  Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act § 1 (1991), codified at  Uniform Probate Code § 2-511 (pourover devise to trust valid regardless of existence, size, or character of trust corpus). See also  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 19 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996).
          </p>
          <p>
           While this section refers to transfer of property to a trustee, a trust can be created even though for a period of time no trustee is in office. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 2 cmt. g (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 2  cmt. i (1959). A trust can also be created without notice to or acceptance by a trustee or beneficiary. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 14 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 35 -36 (1959).
          </p>
          <p>
           Though the list of methods specified in this section is not an exclusive list, it is more exhaustive than that contained in section 401 of the Uniform Trust Code in that this section also specifically provides for the creation of a trust by a court pursuant to its statutory or equitable powers in accord with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-102" target="_self">35-15-102</a></cite>. For methods of creating a trust in general, see  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 1 cmt. a (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Uniform Probate Code § 2-212 (elective share of incapacitated surviving spouse to be held in trust on terms specified in statute); Uniform Probate Code § 5-411(a)(4) (conservator may create trust with court approval); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 17  cmt. i (1959) (trusts created by statutory right to bring wrongful death action).
          </p>
          <p>
           A trust can also be created by a promise that creates enforceable rights in a person who immediately or later holds these rights as trustee. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 10(e) (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996). A trust thus created is valid notwithstanding that the trustee may resign or die before the promise is fulfilled. Unless expressly made personal, the promise can be enforced by a successor trustee. For examples of trusts created by means of promises enforceable by the trustee, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 10 cmt. g (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 14  cmt. h, 26 cmt. n (1959).
          </p>
          <p>
           A trust created by self-declaration is best created by reregistering each of the assets that comprise the trust into the settlor’s name as trustee. However, such reregistration is not necessary to create the trust. See , Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 10 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 17  cmt. a (1959). A declaration of trust can be funded merely by attaching a schedule listing the assets that are to be subject to the trust without executing separate instruments of transfer. But such practice can make it difficult to later confirm title with third party transferees and for this reason is not recommended.
          </p>
          <p>
           While a trust created by will may come into existence immediately at the testator’s death and not necessarily only upon the later transfer of title from the personal representative, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite> makes clear that the nominated trustee does not have a duty to act until there is an acceptance of the trusteeship, express or implied. Moreover, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite> makes it clear that a unless accepted, a nominated trustee has a reasonable time after knowing both  that they have been designated as a trustee, as well as the nature of the assets that comprise the trust to reject such appointment. To avoid an implied acceptance, a nominated testamentary trustee who is monitoring the actions of the personal representative but who has not yet made a final decision on acceptance should inform the beneficiaries that the nominated trustee has assumed only a limited role. The failure so to inform the beneficiaries could result in liability if misleading conduct by the nominated trustee causes harm to the trust beneficiaries. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 35 cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999).
          </p>
          <p>
           While this subsection (c) of this section confirms the familiar principle that a trust may be created by means of the exercise of a power of appointment the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not legislate comprehensively on the subject of powers of appointment but addresses only selected issues. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-302" target="_self">35-15-302</a></cite> (representation by holder of any  power of appointment and not just a general testamentary power of appointment as in the Uniform Trust Code) and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite> concerning the rights of holder of power of withdrawal. For the law on powers of appointment generally, see Restatement (Second) of Property: Donative Transfers §§ 11.1 -24.4 (1986); Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers (in progress). Notwithstanding the references to the respective restatements, The provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code relative to powers of appointment diverge significantly from such restatements. To the extent the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is in conflict with any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

          </p>
          <p>
           Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (a) codifies the basic requirements for the creation of a trust. To create a valid trust, the settlor must indicate an intention to create a trust. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 13 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 23  (1959). But only such manifestations of intent as are admissible as proof in a judicial proceeding may be considered. See  section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> for the definition of “terms of a trust.”
          </p>
          <p>
           To create a trust, a settlor must have the requisite mental capacity. To create a revocable or testamentary trust, the settlor must have the capacity to make a will. To create an irrevocable trust, the settlor must have capacity during life-time to transfer the property free of trust. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-601" target="_self">35-15-601</a></cite> (capacity of settlor to create revocable trust), and See generally  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 11 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 18 -22 (1959); and Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 8.1 (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2001).
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and unlike under the law of some states (e.g., Florida), neither a revocable or irrevocable trust (pour-over or non-pour-over), even one containing testamentary dispositions, need be made with the formalities of a will. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-601" target="_self">35-15-601</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subdivision (a)(3) requires that a trust, other than a charitable trust, a trust for the care of an animal, or a trust for another valid noncharitable purpose, have a definite beneficiary. While some beneficiaries will be definitely ascertained as of the trust’s creation, subsection (b) recognizes that others may be ascertained in the future as long as this occurs within the applicable perpetuities period. The definite beneficiary requirement does not prevent a settlor from making a disposition in favor of a class of persons. Class designations are valid as long as the membership of the class will be finally determined within the applicable perpetuities period. For background on the definite beneficiary requirement, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts §§ 44-46 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 112 -122 (1959).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subdivision (a)(4) recites standard doctrine that a trust is created only if the trustee has duties to perform. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 2 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 2  (1959). Trustee duties are usually active, but a validating duty may also be passive, implying only that the trustee has an obligation not to interfere with the trustee’s enjoyment of the trust property. Such passive trusts, while valid under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, may be terminable if this state recognizes the common law Statute of Uses. Whether Tennessee ever recognized such statute is not clear and different compendiums of older Tennessee law disagree, see The Encyclopedic Digest of Tennessee Reports : Being a Complete Encyclopedia and Digest of All the Tennessee Case Law Up to and Including Vol. 115 Tennessee Reports, Cooper’s Chancery Reports, Shannon’s Tennessee Cases, and the Tennessee Chancery Appeals Reports, Volume 12, Michie Company (1908) at 125 (now only available by Google eBook) and A Treatise on the Law of Trusts and Trustees,  7th Ed., Vol. 1., by Jairus Ware Perry, revised and enlarged by Raymond C. Baldes (1929) at 529 (available by Google eBooks). In the latter publication it states “In Tennessee, the statute of uses seems to be in force.” Citing: Hughes v. Farmers’ Sav. & Bldg. & Loan Ass’n,  46 S.W. 362 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1897); Temple v. Ferguson , 110 Tenn. 84 (Tenn. 1903); Hart v. Bayliss , 97 Tenn. 72 (Tenn. 1896). See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 6 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 67 -72 (1959).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subdivision (a)(5) addresses the doctrine of merger, which, as traditionally stated, provides that a trust is not created if the settlor is the sole trustee and sole beneficiary of all beneficial interests. The doctrine of merger has been inappropriately applied by the courts in some jurisdictions to invalidate self-declarations of trust in which the settlor is the sole life beneficiary but other persons are designated as beneficiaries of the remainder. The doctrine of merger is properly applicable only if all beneficial interests, both life interests and remainders, are vested in the same person, whether in the settlor or someone else. An example of a trust to which the doctrine of merger would apply is a trust of which the settlor is sole trustee, sole beneficiary for life, and with the remainder payable to the settlor’s probate estate. On the doctrine of merger generally, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 69 (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2001); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 341  (1959).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (c) allows a settlor to empower the trustee to select the beneficiaries even if the class from whom the selection may be made cannot be ascertained. Such a provision would fail under traditional doctrine; it is an imperative power with no designated beneficiary capable of enforcement. Such a provision is valid, however, under both the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and the restatement, if there is at least one person who can meet the description. If the trustee does not exercise the power within a reasonable time, the power fails and the property will pass by resulting trust. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 46 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). See also Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 122  (1959); Restatement (Second) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.1  cmt. e (1986).

          <p>
           The validity of a trust created by will is ordinarily determined by the law of the decedent’s domicile. No such certainty exists with respect to determining the law governing the validity of inter vivos trusts. Generally, at common law a trust was created if it complied with the law of the state having the most significant contacts to the trust. Contacts for making this determination include the domicile of the trustee, the domicile of the settlor at the time of trust creation, the location of the trust property, the place where the trust instrument was executed, and the domicile of the beneficiary. See  5A Austin Wakeman Scott & William Franklin Fratcher, The Law of Trusts §§ 597, 599 (4th ed. 1987). Furthermore, if the trust has contacts with two or more states, one of which would validate the trust’s creation and the other of which would deny the trust’s validity, the tendency is to select the law upholding the validity of the trust. See  5A Austin Wakeman Scott & William Franklin Fratcher, The Law of Trusts 600 (4th ed. 1987).
          </p>
          <p>
           This section extends the common law rule by validating a trust if its creation complies with the law of any of a variety of states in which the settlor or trustee had the requisite contacts. Pursuant to this section, a trust not created by will is validly created if its creation complies with the law of the jurisdiction in which the trust instrument was executed, or the law of the jurisdiction in which, at the time of creation the settlor was domiciled, had a place of abode, or was a national; the trustee was domiciled or had a place of business; or any trust property was located.
          </p>
          <p>
           This section is somewhat comparable to section 2-506 of the Uniform Probate Code, which validates wills executed in compliance with the law of a variety of places in which the testator had a significant contact. Unlike the Uniform Probate Code, however, this section is not limited to execution of the instrument but applies to the entire process of a trust’s creation, including compliance with the requirement that there be trust property. In addition, unlike the Uniform Probate Code, this section validates a trust valid under the law of the domicile or place of business of the designated trustee, or if valid under the law of the place where any of the trust property is located.
          </p>
          <p>
           The section does not supersede any requirements of this state relative to the valid transfer of real property.

         <p>
          A trust may be created only to the extent its purposes are lawful and possible to achieve. A trust and its terms must be for the benefit of its beneficiaries as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust.

           <p>
            The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
           </p>
           <p>
            This section requires that the purposes of a trust be lawful and possible to achieve. It also requires that a trust and its terms be for the benefit of its beneficiaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements, this section does not contain a prohibition of purposes “contrary to public policy.” The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code recognizes that some purposes may be so noxious as to truly offend public policy. However, the existence of an offense rising to such level should not be easily found, and under the Tennessee trust statutes such existence is likely more difficult to find than under the Uniform Trust Code, some other jurisdictions’ laws and the various restatements. This view is in keeping with primary objectives of the Tennessee trust statutes that a settlor’s intent be the lodestar by which a trust is interpreted, that such intent be carried out and that settlors have the freedom to dispose of their assets to whom and in the manner they wish, all to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable, as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite> requires that a determination of whether a trust and its terms are “for the benefit of its beneficiaries,” be made solely considering how such “interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust .” [emphasis added]
           </p>
           <p>
            Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite>, a trust must have an identifiable beneficiary unless the trust is of a type that does not have beneficiaries in the usual sense, such as a charitable trust or, as provided in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>, trusts for the care of an animal or other valid noncharitable purpose. The general purpose of trusts having identifiable beneficiaries is to benefit those beneficiaries in accordance with their interests as such interest is defined in the terms of the trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            While a settlor has considerable latitude in specifying how a particular trust purpose is to be pursued, the administrative and other nondispositive trust terms must reasonably relate to this purpose and not divert the trust property to achieve a trust purpose that is invalid, such as one which is frivolous or capricious.
           </p>
           <p>
            The provision of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> that allows the court to modify administrative terms that are impracticable, wasteful (but relative to the use in this section of the word “wasteful,” see the interpretation given to such word in the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite>, resulting in such word being interpreted to mean “obsolete or ineffective,” such interpretation arguably being applicable to this section as well), or impair the trust’s administration, is a specific application of the requirement that a trust and its terms be for the benefit of the beneficiaries as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined in the terms of the trust. The fact that it is determined that a settlor suggests or directs an unlawful or other inappropriate means for performing a trust does not invalidate the trust if the trust has a substantial purpose that can be achieved by other methods. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 28 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999).

            Persons interpreting T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> to examine if the terms meet the standards therein for modification or termination are directed to this section, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>, as well as the overriding emphasis of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition. In all of the above ways, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverges significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and from certain portions of the restatements. In all such cases of divergence, Tennessee law controls.

          <p>
           Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the law relative to charitable trusts diverges somewhat from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section or other provisions of the law concerning charitable trusts under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           The required purposes of a charitable trust specified in subsection (a) restate the well-established categories of charitable purposes listed in Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 28 (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 368  (1959), which ultimately derive from the Statute of Charitable Uses, 43 Eliz. I, c.4 (1601). The directive to the courts to validate purposes the achievement of which are beneficial to the community has proved to be remarkably adaptable over the centuries.
          </p>
          <p>
           Charitable trusts are subject to the restriction in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> that a charitable trust purpose must be legal. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> does not require that a trust purpose not be contrary to public policy. See  the section comment to T.C.A. § 35-15-404 for the effect of this under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under subsection (b), a trust that states a general charitable purpose does not fail if the settlor neglected to specify a particular charitable purpose or organization to receive distributions. The court may instead validate the trust by specifying particular charitable purposes or recipients, or delegate to the trustee the framing of an appropriate scheme. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 397  cmt. d (1959). Subsection (b) of this section is a corollary to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite>, which states the doctrine of cy pres. But note that, a courts ability to apply cy pres under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> is subject to a stricter standard that that afforded by the Uniform Trust Code. Under T.C.A. § 35-15-413, a trust failing to state a general charitable purpose does not fail upon failure of the particular means specified in the terms of the trust. However, the court must instead apply the trust property in a manner that fulfills as nearly as possible the settlor’s charitable intent and purposes  to the extent they can be ascertained. On the other hand, the Uniform Trust Code only requires that the court apply the trust property in a manner consistent with the settlor’s charitable purposes  to the extent they can be ascertained. The language of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contained in T.C.A. § 35-15-413 is designed to restrict, to the greatest extent possible, the likelihood that application of trust property strays far from a settlor’s intent, to the extent it can be ascertained, and therefore results in an application in favor of some watered down, vague and general charitable purpose. See  section comment T.C.A. § 35-15-413 for a further discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (b) does not apply to the long-established estate planning technique of delegating to the trustee the selection of the charitable purposes or recipients. In that case, judicial intervention to supply particular terms is not necessary to validate the creation of the trust. The necessary terms instead will be supplied by the trustee. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 396  (1959). Judicial intervention under subsection (b) will become necessary only if the trustee fails to make a selection. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 397  cmt. d (1959). Pursuant to subsection T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite>, the charitable organizations selected by the trustee would not have the rights of qualified beneficiaries under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code because they are not expressly designated to receive distributions under the terms of the trust. However, it is possible that a trust advisor or trust protector might have such rights, as well as the right to enforce the trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Contrary to Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 391  (1959), subsection (c) grants a settlor standing to maintain an action to enforce a charitable trust. The grant of standing to the settlor does not negate the right of the state attorney general to enforce either the trust and relevant interests thereto. For the law on the enforcement of charitable trusts, see Susan N. Gary, Regulating the Management of Charities: Trust Law, Corporate Law, and Tax Law, 21 U. Hawaii L. Rev. 593 (1999) .
          </p>
          <p>
           Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, a trust advisor or trust protector, given the power to do so, may also seek to enforce a charitable trust or for the application of cy pres.

           This section is a specific application of Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 12 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 333  (1959), which provide that a trust can be set aside or reformed on the same grounds as those which apply to a transfer of property not in trust, among which include undue influence, duress, and fraud, and mistake. This section addresses undue influence, duress, and fraud. For reformation of a trust on grounds of mistake, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite>. See also Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 8.3 (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), which closely tracks the language above.

           While it is always advisable for a settlor to reduce a trust to writing, this section of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code follows established law in recognizing oral trusts. Such trusts are viewed with caution, however. The requirement of this section that an oral trust can be established only by clear and convincing evidence is a higher standard than is in effect in many states. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 20  Reporter’s Notes (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996).

           T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> validate so called honorary trusts. Unlike honorary trusts created pursuant to the common law of trusts, which are arguably no more than powers of appointment, the trusts created by such two sections are valid and enforceable as trusts for a period of up to ninety (90) years. For a discussion of the common law doctrine, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 47 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 124  (1959).
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> addresses a particular type of honorary trust, the trust for the care of an animal. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> specifies the requirements for trusts without ascertainable beneficiaries that are created for other noncharitable purposes, often called “purpose trusts.”
          </p>
          <p>
           A trust for the care of an animal may last for the life of the animal. While the animal will ordinarily be alive on the date the trust is created, an animal may be added as a beneficiary after that date as long as the addition is made prior to the settlor’s death. Animals in gestation but not yet born at the time of the trust's creation may also be covered by its terms. A trust authorized by this section may be created to benefit one designated animal or several designated animals. Subsection (a) provides that, regardless of the length of the life or lives of the animal(s), a trust for the care of an animal can only be enforced for a period of ninety (90) years.
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408ol1b" target="_self">35-15-408(b)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>(2) address enforcement. Noncharitable trusts ordinarily may be enforced by their beneficiaries. However, for reasons similar to those applying to charitable trusts, no animal under a trust for the care of an animal as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite>, nor anyone (person, entity or otherwise) benefiting from or having an interest in the purpose for which a trust is established under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> are beneficiaries as that term is defined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, relative to trusts controlled by T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> and 35-15-409, there are no qualified beneficiaries under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           At common law, a trust for the care of an animal or a trust without an ascertainable beneficiary created for a non-charitable purpose was unenforceable because there was no person authorized to enforce the trustee’s obligations. T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> close this gap. The intended use of a trust authorized by either section may be enforced by a person designated in the terms of the trust, which under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code (but arguably not under the Uniform Trust Code, such not providing specifically for same) can include a trust advisor or trust protector. If no such person exists, a trust created under either section can be enforced by a person appointed by the court. Notwithstanding the above, in either case, such person, due solely to holding such enforcement power, is not a qualified beneficiary under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the trust is created for the care of an animal, a person with an interest in the welfare of the animal also has standing to petition for an appointment to the court for someone to enforce the trust (and also has standing to so petition, but for removal of any such person). The person appointed by the court to enforce the trust should also be a person who has exhibited an interest in the animal’s welfare. The concept of granting standing to a person with a demonstrated interest in the animal’s welfare is derived from the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act, which allows a person interested in the welfare of a ward or protected person to file petitions on behalf of the ward or protected person. See, e.g ., Uniform Probate Code §§ 5-210(b), 5-414(a).
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408ol1c" target="_self">35-15-408(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409ol13" target="_self">35-15-409(3)</a></cite> address the problem of excess funds. If the court determines that the trust property exceeds the amount needed for the intended purpose and that the terms of the trust do not direct the disposition, a resulting trust is ordinarily created in the settlor or settlor’s successors in interest. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 47 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 124  (1959). Successors in interest include the beneficiaries under the settlor’s will, if the settlor has a will, or in the absence of an effective will provision, the settlor’s heirs. The settlor may also anticipate the problem of excess funds by directing their disposition in the terms of the trust. The disposition of excess funds is within the settlor’s control. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite>. While a trust for an animal or for a noncharitable trust without ascertainable beneficiary is often not created until the settlor’s death, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408ol1a" target="_self">35-15-408(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409ol11" target="_self">35-15-409(1)</a></cite> allow either such type of trust to be created during the settlor's lifetime. Accordingly, if the settlor is still living, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408ol1c" target="_self">35-15-408(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409ol13" target="_self">35-15-409(3)</a></cite> provide for distribution of excess funds to the settlor, and not to the settlor’s successors in interest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Should the means chosen not be particularly efficient, a trust created for the care of an animal can also be terminated by the trustee or court under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>. Due to the nature of a trust for the care of an animal and the fact such trust has no beneficiaries, it is not possible to distribute the trust property “to the or for the benefit of the beneficiaries…” as provided in such section. Therefore, termination of a trust under such section, requires that the trustee or court develop an alternative means for carrying out the trust purposes in a manner that conforms as nearly as possible to the intention of the settlor.

          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> authorizes two types of trusts without ascertainable beneficiaries; trusts for general but non-charitable purposes, and trusts for a specific noncharitable purpose other than the care of an animal, the latter of which is controlled by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such trusts are often referred to as “purpose trusts.”
          </p>
          <p>
           Examples of trusts for general noncharitable purposes include a bequest of money to be distributed to such objects of benevolence as the trustee might select. Unless such attempted disposition was interpreted as charitable, at common law the disposition was honorary only and did not create a trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>, however, the disposition under this form of purpose trust is enforceable as a trust for a period of up to ninety (90) years, which is significantly longer than the Uniform Trust Code default of twenty-one (21) years.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although there are numerous types of trusts for specific noncharitable purposes, such purposes being virtually unlimited, a common example of a such type of trust is a trust for the care of a cemetery plot. The lead-in language to the section recognizes that some special purpose trusts, particularly those for care of cemetery plots, are subject to other statutes. Such legislation will typically endeavor to facilitate perpetual care as opposed to care limited to ninety (90) years as under this section
          </p>
          <p>
           For the requirement that a trust, particularly the type of trust authorized by this section, must have a purpose that is not capricious, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> and the comments thereunder. However, note that unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> and the comments thereunder contain no requirement that the purpose of a trust “not be contrary to public policy.”
          </p>
          <p>
           For examples of the types of trusts authorized by this section, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 47 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 62  cmt. w and § 124 (1959). The case law on capricious purposes is collected in 2 Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 124.7 (4th ed. 1987).
          </p>
          <p>
           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> is similar to section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite>, although the comments under the former section are less detailed than those under the latter section. Much comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> also applies to this section and in many cases the comments to T.C.A. § 35-15-408 specifically refer their application to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           It should be noted that a noncharitable trust without ascertainable beneficiary is a type of trust that can likely be benefitted greatly by the appointment of a trust advisor or trust protector pursuant to part 12 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

            Co-trustee sought a declaration that the settlement, which sought termination of the trust, violated the Tennessee Uniform Trust Act and, as such, should not be enforced; in short, the co-trustee filed a suit to disapprove a proposed termination of the trust.

            Tennessee Uniform Trust Act contains no requirement that the trustee specifically request approval of termination or modification of the trust; rather, the trustee need only commence a proceeding to approve or disapprove a proposed modification or termination.

           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> contains no provision that a trust terminates to the extent the purposes of the trust have become contrary to public policy. For a discussion of the reason for this, as well as the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s view regarding “public policy,” see the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is far easier for a purpose of a trust to rise to being “material” under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code than under the Uniform Trust Code. This is due to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1c" target="_self">35-15-105(c)</a></cite>, differences between the language to the section comment of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> relative to the definition of “spendthrift provision” and the comment to the definition of “spendthrift provision” in Uniform Trust Code section 103(16), as well as the omission of a provision similar to Uniform Trust Code section 411(c) in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> and differences in the comments under such respective versions of such section.
          </p>
          <p>
           Other types of terminations, all of which require action by a court, trustee, or beneficiaries, are covered in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>, which also address trust modification. Of these sections, all but T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> apply to charitable trusts and all but T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> apply to noncharitable trusts.
          </p>
          <p>
           Withdrawal of the trust property is not an event terminating a trust. The trust remains in existence although the trustee has no duties to perform unless and until property is later contributed to the trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (b) specifies the persons who have standing to seek court approval or disapproval of proposed trust modifications, terminations, combinations, or divisions. An approval or disapproval may be sought for an action that does not require court permission, including a petition questioning the trustee’s distribution upon termination of a trust under one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>, and a petition to approve or disapprove a proposed trust division or consolidation under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>. Unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, under this subsection (b) a settlor has no right or power to commence a judicial proceeding to approve or disapprove a proposed modification or termination of a noncharitable irrevocable trust under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>. Contrary to Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 391  (1959), subsection (b) grants a settlor standing to petition the court under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite> to apply cy pres to modify the settlor’s charitable trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (c) does not have a Uniform Trust Code equivalent and clarifies that a trustee has no duty to make or seek approval of any modification, termination, combination, or division of any trust and cannot be held liable for failing to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (d) does not have a Uniform Trust Code equivalent and prohibits a modification, termination, combination, or division that would cause adverse tax consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, a trust advisor or trust protector may have the power to directly or indirectly modify a trust without being subject to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>.

           Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>.

           The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           This section describes the circumstances in which termination or modification of a noncharitable irrevocable trust may be compelled by the qualified beneficiaries, with or without the objection of the settlor. For provisions governing modification or termination of trusts without the need to seek beneficiary consent, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> (modification or termination due to unanticipated circumstances or inability to administer trust effectively), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite> (termination or modification of uneconomic noncharitable trust), and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite> (modification to achieve settlor's tax objectives). If the trust is revocable by the settlor, the method of revocation specified in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite> applies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (a) states the requirements under this section for termination or modification by consent of the trustee and all qualified beneficiaries during the settlor's life. Note that the procedure under subsection (a) is significantly different than under either option contained in Uniform Trust Code section 411(a). First the action to modify or terminate cannot be brought by the settlor and does not require the settlors pre-consent thereto. Likewise it does not require court intervention or approval. Moreover, it does not require consent of all beneficiaries. Under this subsection (a), upon the agreement of the trustee and all qualified beneficiaries such trust can be terminated or modified, even if such action is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. The settlor’s interests are protected by requiring specified notice be given to the settlor sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the action. The settlor must notify the trustee of an objection to the action within such sixty (60) days or such action is effective. Should the settlor file such objection, such action will not take place. There is no alternative method under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> to effect such modification or termination during a settlor’s life if the settlor so objects (though such may be available under other sections of part 4 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and a trust advisor or trust protector, if such holds the power to do so, may effect such action regardless of the requirements of subsection (a)).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (b) states the requirements under this section for termination or modification upon consent of all qualified beneficiaries by the court following the settlor's death. Note that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires consent of all qualified  beneficiaries and not of all beneficiaries  as under Uniform Trust Code section 411(b). Moreover, unlike Uniform Trust Code section 411(b), such subsection (b) only applies after the settlor’s death. Uniform Trust Code section 411(b) applies whether or not a settlor is alive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under subsection (b), a trust may be modified or terminated over a trustee's objection (but unlike under Uniform Trust Code section 411(b), not over the objection of a settlor while the settlor is living). Regardless, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite>, a trustee has standing to object to a proposed termination or modification under subsection (b).
          </p>
          <p>
           Although, concurrent with the 2007 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code consideration was given to allowing the trustee and qualified beneficiaries to consent to modification or termination after the settlor's death, the consensus of the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code was that requiring court approval was a beneficial protection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Any requirement by this section of court approval does not apply to matters specifically authorized to be handled by nonjudicial settlement under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111" target="_self">35-15-111</a></cite>. The actions authorized under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111" target="_self">35-15-111</a></cite> are not an exclusive list. Nonjudicial settlement agreements between the trustee and the qualified beneficiaries should be applicable to the resolution of any matter of an administrative nature that does not alter a beneficiary's income or principal interest in the trust. Any proposed change that alters a beneficiary's income or principal interest in the trust must be submitted for court approval. A proposal to extend the term of a trust or to convert the trust to a total return trust in compliance with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-101" target="_self">35-6-101</a></cite> et seq. is not an alteration of a beneficiary's income or principal interest in the trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (c) directs how the trust property is to be distributed following a termination under either subsection (a) or (b). Note that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code only requires agreement as to distribution by all qualified  beneficiaries and not by all beneficiaries , as is required by Uniform Trust Code section 411(c).
          </p>
          <p>
           The provisions of part 3 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> ] on representation, virtual representation and the appointment and approval of representatives appointed by the court apply to the determination of whether the required beneficiaries have signified consent under this section. The authority to consent on behalf of another person, however, does not include authority to consent over the other person's objection. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite>(b). Regarding the per-sons who may consent on behalf of a beneficiary, see T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-302" target="_self">35-15-302</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite>. Note that unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, a consent given by a representative is invalid only to the extent there is a material  conflict of interest between the representative and the person represented. The Uniform Trust Code requires no conflict of interest . Due to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s “materiality” requirement regarding conflicts of interest and the availability of representation, virtual representation of a beneficiary's interest by another beneficiary pursuant to section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-304" target="_self">35-15-304</a></cite> should be much more readily available in a trust termination case than under Uniform Trust Code section 304 (to which the comments thereto state such representation is “rarely” available in a trust termination case). It should likewise be routinely available in cases involving trust modification, such as a grant to the trustee of additional powers. If virtual or other form of representation is unavailable (such being much less likely under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code than under the Uniform Trust Code), T.C.A. § 35-15-305 permits the court to appoint a representative who may give the necessary consent to the proposed modification or termination on behalf of the minor, incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained beneficiary. The ability to use virtual and other forms of representation to consent on a beneficiary's behalf to a trust termination or modification has not traditionally been part of the law, although there are some notable exceptions. Compare  Restatement (Second) § 337(1) (1959) (beneficiary must not be under incapacity), with Hatch v. Riggs National Bank, 361 F.2d 559 (D.C. Cir. 1966)  (guardian ad litem authorized to consent on beneficiary's behalf).
          </p>
          <p>
           Termination under subsection (a) does not require a finding that the trust no longer serves a material purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, subsection (b) does require that a court conclude that no material purpose exists that requires the trust to continue, the finding of such, therefore, blocking termination. Moreover, it is far easier for a purpose of a trust to rise to “material” status under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code than under the Uniform Trust Code. This is due to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1c" target="_self">35-15-105(c)</a></cite>, differences between the language to the section comment of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> relative to the definition of “spendthrift provision” and the comment to the definition of “spendthrift provision” in Uniform Trust Code section 103(16), as well as the omission of a provision similar to Uniform Trust Code section 411(c), as well as the language relevant thereto, in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> and the comments thereunder.
          </p>
          <p>
           Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, subsection (b) will still allow the qualified beneficiaries to compel termination of a trust that still serves a material purpose if the reasons for termination outweigh the continuing material pur-pose.
          </p>
          <p>
           Moreover, subject to the potentially higher likelihood that a material trust purpose exists as discussed in the para-graph above, subsection (b), similar to Restatement Third but not Restatement Second, allows modification by the qualified beneficiaries of any term of the trust if the court concludes that modification is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. Restatement Third, though, goes further than the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in also allowing the qualified beneficiaries to use trust modification as a basis for removing the trustee if removal would not be inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. Such is not the case under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, This is because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite> is the exclusive provision regarding removal of trustees. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706ol1b4" target="_self">35-15-706(b)(4)</a></cite> recognizes that a request for removal upon unanimous agreement of the qualified beneficiaries is a factor for the court to consider, but before removing the trustee the court must also find that such action best serves the interests of all the beneficiaries, that removal is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust, and that a suitable cotrustee or successor trustee is available. Compare  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706ol1b4" target="_self">35-15-706(b)(4)</a></cite>, with  Restatement (Third) Section 65 cmt. f (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001).
          </p>
          <p>
           The requirement that the trust no longer serve a material purpose before it can be terminated by the beneficiaries does not mean that the trust must have no remaining function. In order to be material, the purpose remaining to be performed must be of some significance.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (c) recognizes that the qualified beneficiaries' power to compel termination of the trust includes the right to direct how the trust property is to be distributed. Once termination has been approved, how the trust property is to be distributed is solely subject to the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that while no gift tax consequences result from a termination as long as the beneficiaries agree to distribute the trust property in accordance with the value of the beneficiary’s respective proportionate interests, significant gift taxes can occur if such beneficiaries do not so agree, or in any event distribute the property in a manner not so in accordance.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (d) creates a procedure for judicial approval of a proposed termination or modification during the settlor’s life when, although the settlor did not object after being provided with the requisite notice , less than all of the qualified beneficiaries consented to such termination or modification.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (d) also, similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 65 cmt. c (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 338(2)  & 340(2) (1959), addresses situations after the settlor’s death in which a termination or modification is requested by less than all the qualified beneficiaries, either because a qualified beneficiary objects, the consent of a qualified beneficiary cannot be obtained, or representation is either unavailable or its application uncertain.
          </p>
          <p>
           In either case, subsection (d) allows the court to fashion an appropriate order protecting the interests of the nonconsenting qualified beneficiaries while at the same time permitting the remainder of the trust property to be distributed without restriction. The order of protection for the nonconsenting qualified beneficiaries might include partial continuation of the trust, the purchase of an annuity, or the valuation and cashout of the interest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that relative to all the provisions of subsection (d), only the qualified  beneficiaries and their interests are subject to consideration. This is unlike Uniform Trust Code section 411(e) (the corresponding provision in the Uniform Trust Code), under which the all  beneficiaries and their interests are subject to consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (e) is not contained in the Uniform Trust Code. It is a tax savings provision and clarifies that this section applies to trusts with a small charitable interest if no charitable tax deduction was allowed with respect to the funding of the trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (f) is not contained in the Uniform Trust Code. It gives a trustee the right to always seek court approval of a modification or termination under subsection (a), even though such is not otherwise required.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code a trust advisor or trust protector may have the power to directly or indirectly modify a trust without being subject to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>.

           Section Comment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           This section broadens the court's ability to apply equitable deviation to terminate or modify a trust. Subsection (a) allows a court to modify the dispositive provisions of the trust as well as its administrative terms. For example, modification of the dispositive provisions to increase support of a beneficiary might be appropriate if the beneficiary has be-come unable to provide for support due to poor health or serious injury. Subsection (a) is similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 66(1) (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), except that this section, unlike the Restatement, does not impose a duty on the trustee to petition the court if the trustee is aware of circumstances justifying judicial modification. The purpose of the “equitable deviation” authorized by subsection (a) is not to disregard the settlor's intent but to modify inopportune details to effectuate better the settlor's broader purposes. Nevertheless, in light of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite> and other portions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code that repeatedly stress the importance of settlor’s intent, when exercising its equitable powers under subsection (a), a court should deviate in a manner that fills as nearly as possible the settlor’s intent and purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Among other things, equitable deviation may be used to modify administrative or dispositive terms due to the failure to anticipate economic change or the incapacity of a beneficiary. For numerous illustrations, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 66 cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001). While it is necessary that there be circumstances not anticipated by the settlor before the court may grant relief under subsection (a), the circumstances may have been in existence when the trust was created. This section thus complements T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite>, which allows for reformation of a trust based on mistake of fact or law at the creation of the trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (b) broadens the court's ability to modify the administrative terms of a trust. The standard under subsection (b) is similar to the standard for applying cy pres to a charitable trust. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413ol1a" target="_self">35-15-413(a)</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that, relative to applying cy pres, unlike in the Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413ol1a" target="_self">35-15-413(a)</a></cite> does not does not contain the word “wasteful,” and substitutes the words “obsolete or ineffective” as grounds for modification or termination because the word “wasteful” is believed to be too vague and subject to too broad of interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although the literal language of subsection (b) uses the Uniform Trust Code word “wasteful,” it is the opinion of the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, that the proper way to interpret the word “wasteful” in this section is to mean “obsolete or ineffective.” Such drafters state this for several reasons. First, the purposes of subsection (b) and of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413ol1a" target="_self">35-15-413(a)</a></cite> are virtually identical, with the former applying to non-charitable trusts and the latter to charitable trusts and therefore should be subject to the same standard. The most recent legislative expression of that standard is contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413ol1a" target="_self">35-15-413(a)</a></cite>, such having been amended in 2013 while subsection (b) has not ever been amended since the original adoption of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Finally, while recognizing that at times trusts need modification, the Tennessee trust statutes have a very high regard to settlor’s intent. This last sentence would indicate the exercise of judicial restraint throughout the interpretation and implementation of this section.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsections (a) and (b) are not mutually exclusive. Many situations justifying modification of administrative terms under subsection (a) will also justify modification under subsection (b). Subsection (b) is also an application of the requirement in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> that a trust and its terms must be for the benefit of its beneficiaries augmented pursuant to the standard required by the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> that such “benefit of its beneficiaries” must be interpreted “as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust.” Such provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> are controlling throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and should, therefore, always be deemed to modify the phrase “that a trust and its terms must be for the benefit of its beneficiaries,” regardless of where such phrase is found in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. See section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           In general, due to its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code greatly limits, and to a significant extent, rejects, the views contained in the comment to Uniform Trust Code section 412, referencing the restatements, that are contained in the immediately following paragraph. It is the view of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code that such following comment of the Uniform Trust Code is overly broad. For a few examples of how the view of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverge from that of the Uniform Trust Code (and the restatements) see  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite> and (c) and the section comments thereto; T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> and the section comment thereto; as well as the entire comments to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such divergent views held by the comment to Uniform Trust Code section 412 are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
           “See also , Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 27(2) & cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). Although the settlor is granted considerable latitude in defining the purposes of the trust, the principle that a trust have a purpose which is for the benefit of its beneficiaries precludes unreasonable restrictions on the use of trust property. An owner's freedom to be capricious about the use of the owner's own property ends when the property is impressed with a trust for the benefit of others. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 124  cmt. g (1959). Thus, attempts to impose unreasonable restrictions on the use of trust property will fail. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 27  Reporter's Notes to cmt. b (Ten-tative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). Subsection (b), unlike subsection (a), does not have a direct precedent in the common law.”
          </p>
          <p>
           While Tennessee desires the flexibility provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite>, such flexibility must be balanced with settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition.
          </p>
          <p>
           Upon termination of a trust under this section, subsection (c) requires that the trust be distributed in a manner consistent with the purposes of the trust, as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust. As under the doctrine of cy pres, effectuating a distribution consistent with the purposes of the trust, as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust, requires an examination of what will fulfill as nearly as possible the settlor’s intent and purposes had the settlor been aware of the unanticipated circumstances. Typically, such terminating distributions will be made to the qualified beneficiaries, often in proportion to the actuarial value of their interests, although the section does not so prescribe. For the definition of qualified beneficiary, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Modification under this section, because it does not require beneficiary action, is not necessarily precluded by a spendthrift provision. However, the court is urged to consider whether a spendthrift (or any other) provision is a material purpose of the trust and if it finds such purpose should be reluctant to terminate the trust, balancing the benefit of any such material purpose with the perceived need to terminate the trust. Moreover, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1c" target="_self">35-15-105(c)</a></cite>, “Any purpose enunciated as a material purpose of a trust in that trust's trust instrument shall be treated as a material purpose of that trust for all purposes of this chapter and chapter 16.”

            The provisions of this section in some ways diverge from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the ex-tent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subsection (a) codifies the court's inherent authority to apply cy pres. The power may be applied to modify an administrative or dispositive term. The court may order the trust terminated and distributed to other charitable entities. Partial termination may also be ordered if the trust property is more than sufficient to satisfy the trust's current purposes. Subsection (a), which is similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 67 (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), modifies the doctrine of cy pres by presuming that the settlor had a general charitable intent when a particular charitable purpose becomes impossible or impracticable to achieve. Traditional doctrine did not supply that presumption, leaving it to the courts to determine whether the settlor had a general charitable intent. If such an intent is found, the trust property is applied to other charitable purposes. If not, the charitable trust fails. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 399  (1959). In the great majority of cases the settlor would prefer that the property be used for other charitable purposes. Courts are usually able to find an appropriate charitable purpose to which to apply the property, no matter how vaguely such purpose may have been expressed by the settlor.
           </p>
           <p>
            In keeping with the primary objectives of the Tennessee trust statutes that a settlor’s intent be the lodestar by which a trust is interpreted, that such intent be carried out and that settlors have the freedom to dispose of their assets to whom and in the manner they wish, all to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable, subsection (a) states if the particular purpose for which the trust was created becomes impracticable, unlawful, impossible to achieve, obsolete or ineffective, the trust does not fail. The court instead must either: (a) modify the terms of the trust; or (b) distribute the property of the trust; in either case in a manner that fulfills as nearly as possible the settlor's charitable intent and purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike in the Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, subsection (a) of this section does not contain the word “wasteful,” and substitutes the words “obsolete or ineffective” as grounds for modification or termination because the word “wasteful” is believed to be too vague and subject to too broad of interpretation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also unlike the Uniform Trust Code, which only requires that the manner of any modification or termination be “consistent with the settlor’s charitable purposes,” subsection (a) requires that any such modification or termination be effected in a manner “that fulfills as nearly as possible the settlor’s intent and purposes.” The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code believes that such requirement of subsection (a) is far less likely to effect a modification or termination that strays from a settlor’s intent and purposes and therefore results in favoring some watered down, vague and general, charitable purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            The settlor, with one exception, may mandate that the trust property pass to a noncharitable beneficiary upon failure of a particular charitable purpose (as such is defined in subsection (a) of this section). Responding to concerns about the clogging of title and other administrative problems caused by remote default provisions upon failure of a charitable purpose (as such is defined in subsection (a) of this section), subsection (b) invalidates a gift over to a noncharitable beneficiary upon such failure unless the trust property is to revert to a still living settlor or fewer than 21 years have elapsed since the trust's creation. Subsection (b) will not apply to a charitable lead trust, under which a charity receives payments for a term certain with a remainder to a noncharity. In the case of a charitable lead trust, the settlor's particular charitable purpose does not fail upon completion of the specified trust term and distribution of the remainder to the noncharity. Upon completion of the specified trust term, the settlor's particular charitable purpose has instead been fulfilled. For a discussion of the reasons for a provision such as subsection (b), see Ronald Chester, Cy Pres of Gift Over: The Search for Coherence in Judicial Reform of Failed Charitable Trusts, 23 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 41 (1989).
           </p>
           <p>
            The doctrine of cy pres is applied not only to trusts, but also to other types of charitable dispositions, including those to charitable corporations. This section does not control dispositions made in nontrust form. However, in formulating rules for such dispositions, the courts often refer to the principles governing charitable trusts, which would include the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the definition of charitable purpose, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-405" target="_self">35-15-405</a></cite>.

Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such action can also be maintained by a cotrustee, the Tennessee attorney general, or by a person having a special interest in the charitable disposition. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 391  (1959). Moreover, under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such action can also be maintained by a trust advisor or trust protector, if either holds the power to do so.

           Section Comment.

          <p>
           Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           The provisions of subsection (c) of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (a) assumes that a trust with a value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or less is sufficiently likely to be inefficient to administer that a trustee should be able to terminate it without the expense of a judicial termination proceeding. Because subsection (a) is a default rule, a settlor is free to set a higher or lower figure or to specify different procedures or to prohibit termination without a court order. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite> and the general comment to chapter 4 at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (b) allows the court to modify or terminate a trust if the costs of administration would otherwise be excessive in relation to the size of the trust. The court may terminate a trust under this section even if the settlor has for-bidden it. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b4" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(4)</a></cite>. Judicial termination under this subsection may be used whether or not the trust is larger or smaller than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
          </p>
          <p>
           When considering whether to terminate a trust under either subsection (a) or (b), the trustee or court should consider the purposes of the trust and whether any material purposes exist relative to the trust. Termination under this section is not always wise. Even if administrative costs may seem excessive in relation to the size of the trust, protection of the assets from beneficiary mismanagement or from a beneficiary’s creditors may indicate that the trust be continued. The court may be able to reduce the costs of administering the trust by appointing a new trustee.
          </p>
          <p>
           Upon termination of a trust under this section, subsection (c) requires that the trust property be distributed in a manner that conforms as nearly as possible to the intention of the settlor. Often, distribution under this section will be made to the qualified beneficiaries in proportion to the actuarial value of their interests. However, subsection (c) states that a trust that qualified for the marital deduction for tax purposes shall only be distributed to the spouse of the settlor for whom the trust was created. Overall the provisions of subsection (c) are stricter than those in the Uniform Trust Code and such provisions are designed to further settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to outright distribution to the beneficiaries, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816ol121" target="_self">35-15-816(21)</a></cite> authorizes payment may be made to a variety of alternate payees.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even though not accompanied by the usual trappings of a trust, the creation and transfer of an easement for conservation or preservation will frequently create a charitable trust. The organization to whom the easement was conveyed will be deemed to be acting as trustee of what will ostensibly appear to be a contractual or property arrangement. Because of the fiduciary obligation imposed, the termination or substantial modification of the easement by the “trustee” could constitute a breach of trust. The drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code concluded that easements for conservation or preservation are sufficiently different from the typical cash and securities found in small trusts that they should be excluded from this section, and subsection (d) so provides. Most creators of such easements, it was surmised, would prefer that the easement be continued unchanged even if the easement, and hence the trust, has a relatively low market value. For the law of conservation easements, see Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes § 1.6  (2000).
          </p>
          <p>
           Subsection (e) is not contained in the Uniform Trust Code. It reinforces a trustee’s power, acting alone, to terminate a trust in accordance with the terms contained in a trust instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
           While this section is not directed principally at honorary or purpose trusts, it may be so applied. See  T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because termination of a trust under this section is initiated by the trustee or ordered by the court, it is not necessarily precluded by a spendthrift provision. However, the court is urged to consider whether a spendthrift (or any other) provision is a material purpose of the trust and if it finds such purpose should be reluctant to terminate the trust, balancing the benefit of any such material purpose with the perceived need to terminate the trust. Moreover, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1c" target="_self">35-15-105(c)</a></cite>, “Any purpose enunciated as a material purpose of a trust in that trust's trust instrument shall be treated as a material purpose of that trust for all purposes of this chapter and chapter 16.”
          </p>
          <p>
           Note that under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code a trust advisor or trust protector may have the power to directly or indirectly modify a trust without being subject to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>.

         <p>
          The court may reform the terms of a trust, even if unambiguous, to conform the terms to the settlor's intention if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that both the settlor's intent and the terms of the trust were affected by a mistake of fact or law, whether in expression or inducement.

           Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reformation of inter vivos instruments to correct a mistake of law or fact is a long-established remedy. Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.1 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995), which this section copies, clarifies that this doctrine also applies to wills.
          </p>
          <p>
           This section applies whether the mistake is one of expression or one of inducement. A mistake of expression occurs when the terms of the trust misstate the settlor's intention, fail to include a term that was intended to be included, or include a term that was not intended to be included. A mistake in the inducement occurs when the terms of the trust accurately reflect what the settlor intended to be included or excluded but this intention was based on a mistake of fact or law. See  Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.1 cmt. i (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995). Mistakes of expression are frequently caused by scriveners' errors while mistakes of inducement often trace to errors of the settlor.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reformation is different from resolving an ambiguity. Resolving an ambiguity involves the interpretation of language already in the instrument. Reformation, on the other hand, may involve the addition of language not originally in the instrument, or the deletion of language originally included by mistake, if necessary to conform the instrument to the settlor's intent. Because reformation may involve the addition of language to the instrument, or the deletion of language that may appear clear on its face, reliance on extrinsic evidence is essential. To guard against the possibility of unreliable or contrived evidence in such circumstance, the higher standard of clear and convincing proof is required. See  Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.1 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995).
          </p>
          <p>
           In determining the settlor's original intent, the court may consider evidence relevant to the settlor's intention even though it contradicts an apparent plain meaning of the text. The objective of the plain meaning rule, to protect against fraudulent testimony, is satisfied by the requirement of clear and convincing proof. See  Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.1 cmt. d and Reporter's Notes (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995). See also  John H. Langbein & Lawrence W. Waggoner, Reformation of Wills on the Ground of Mistake: Change of Direction in American Law?, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 521 (1982) .
          </p>
          <p>
           For further discussion of the rule of this section and its application to illustrative cases, see Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.1 cmts. and Reporter's Notes (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995).
          </p>
          <p>
           Notwithstanding the language above in this comment, a court considering reformation should be mindful of and balance the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s emphasis on interpreting the interests of beneficiaries using the standard, “as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust,” which is provided for in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite>.

           This section is copied from Restatement (Third) of Property: Donative Transfers § 12.2 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1995). “Modification” under this section is to be distinguished from the “reformation” authorized by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite>. Reformation under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite> is available when the terms of a trust fail to reflect the donor's original, particularized intention. The mistaken terms are then reformed to conform to this specific intent. The modification authorized here allows the terms of the trust to be changed to meet the settlor's tax-saving objective as long as the resulting terms, particularly the dispositive provisions, are not inconsistent with the settlor's probable intent. The modification allowed by this subsection is similar in concept to the cy pres doctrine for charitable trusts (see  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-413" target="_self">35-15-413</a></cite>), and the deviation doctrine for unanticipated circumstances T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite>). Therefore the comments to such sections of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code regarding honoring settlor’s intent and effecting any necessary modification in a manner “that fulfills as nearly as possible the settlor’s intent and purposes” are applicable to this section as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whether a modification made by the court under this section will be recognized under federal tax law is a matter of federal law. Absent specific statutory or regulatory authority, binding recognition is normally given only to modifications made prior to the taxing event, for example, the death of the testator or settlor in the case of the federal estate tax. See Rev. Rul. 73-142, 1973-1 C.B. 405 . Among the specific modifications authorized by the Internal Revenue Code or Service include the revision of split-interest trusts to qualify for the charitable deduction, modification of a trust for a noncitizen spouse to become eligible as a qualified domestic trust, and the splitting of a trust to utilize better the exemption from generation-skipping tax.

          <p>
           Notwithstanding the language above in this comment, a court considering reformation should be mindful of and balance the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s emphasis on interpreting the interests of beneficiaries using the standard, “as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust,” which is provided for in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite>.

         <p>
          After notice to the qualified beneficiaries, a trustee may combine two (2) or more trusts into a single trust or divide a trust into two (2) or more separate trusts, if the result does not impair rights of any beneficiary or adversely affect the achievement of the purposes of the trust. If the trusts to be combined or divided have different trustees, the trustees may negotiate the terms of the combined or divided trusts, including which trust or trusts will be the surviving trust or trusts, who will be the trustee or trustees of the surviving trust or trusts and any other matter relating to the operation of the surviving trust or trusts.

           Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>.

          <p>
           This section, which authorizes the combination or division of trusts, is subject to contrary provision in the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite> and the general comment to chapter 4 contained at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-401" target="_self">35-15-401</a></cite>. Many trust instruments and standardized estate planning forms include comprehensive provisions governing combination and division of trusts. Except for the requirement that the qualified beneficiaries receive advance notice of a proposed combination or division, this section is similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 68 (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001).
          </p>
          <p>
           This section allows a trustee to combine two or more trusts even though their terms are not identical. Typically the trusts to be combined will have been created by different members of the same family and will vary on only insignificant details, such as the presence of different perpetuities savings periods. The more the dispositive provisions of the trusts to be combined differ from each other the more likely it is that a combination would impair some beneficiary's interest, hence the less likely that the combination will not be objected to by one of the beneficiaries. Combining trusts may prompt more efficient trust administration and is sometimes an alternative to terminating an uneconomic trust as authorized by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>. Administrative economies promoted by combining trusts include a potential reduction in trustees' fees, particularly if the trustee charges a minimum fee per trust, the ability to file one trust income tax return instead of multiple returns, and the ability to invest a larger pool of capital more effectively. Particularly if the terms of the trust are identical, available administrative economies may suggest that the trustee should consider pursuing a combination. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-805" target="_self">35-15-805</a></cite> (duty to incur only reasonable costs).
          </p>
          <p>
           Notwithstanding the above, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410ol1c" target="_self">35-15-410(c)</a></cite>, which does not have a Uniform Trust Code equivalent, makes it clear that, under the Uniform Trust Code, no trustee has a duty to make or seek approval of any modification or termination, including any combination or division, of any trust and cannot be held liable for failing to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
           Division of trusts is often beneficial and, in certain circumstances, almost routine. Division of trusts is frequently undertaken due to a desire to obtain maximum advantage of exemptions available under the federal generation-skipping tax. While the terms of the trusts which result from such a division are identical, the division will permit differing investment objectives to be pursued and allow for discretionary distributions to be made from one trust and not the other. Given the substantial tax benefits often involved, a failure by the trustee to pursue a division might in certain cases be a breach of fiduciary duty. However, see the language from T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410ol1c" target="_self">35-15-410(c)</a></cite> above, which tends to override the previous sentence, such previous sentence coming from the comments to Uniform Trust Code section 417, and as such is not controlling over contrary provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. The opposite could also be true if the division is undertaken to increase fees or to fit within the small trust termination provision. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           This section authorizes a trustee to divide a trust even if the trusts that result are dissimilar. Conflicts among beneficiaries, including differing investment objectives, often invite such a division, although as in the case with a proposed combination of trusts, the more the terms of the divided trusts diverge from the original plan, the less likely it is that the settlor's purposes would be achieved and that the division could be approved.
          </p>
          <p>
           This section does not require that a combination or division be approved either by the court or by the beneficiaries. Prudence may dictate, however, that court approval under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> be sought and beneficiary consent obtained whenever the terms of the trusts to be combined or the trusts that will result from a division differ substantially one from the other. For the provisions relating to beneficiary consent or ratification of a transaction, or release of trustee from liability, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           While the consent of the beneficiaries is not necessary before a trustee may combine or divide trusts under this section, advance notice to the qualified beneficiaries of the proposed combination or division is required. This is consistent with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>, to the extent such section requires that the trustee keep certain beneficiaries reasonably in-formed of trust administration or that the trustee give advance notice to certain required beneficiaries of several speci-fied actions that may have a major impact on their interests.
          </p>
          <p>
           For a provision authorizing a trustee, in distributing the assets of the divided trust, to make non-pro-rata distributions, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816ol1b22" target="_self">35-15-816(b)(22)</a></cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides more flexibility than does the Uniform Trust Code regarding the mechanics with which an actual combination or division will be carried out. Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, in cases where such trusts have or will have different trustees, the two trustees may negotiate the terms of the trust relative to such combination or division.

            </p>
            <p>
             Appellate court construed trust as restraining the voluntary and involuntary transfer of farm property itself, but also as allowing a beneficiary to voluntarily transfer a year's worth of income from the property; thus, that portion of the spendthrift provision pertaining to voluntary alienation of farm income was invalid, and debtor's interest in that income was subject to execution.

            <p>
             General Comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The provisions of part five (5) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverge, in many cases significantly, from the provisions contained in Uniform Trust Code, as well as from the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, on which much of part 5 of the Uniform Trust Code was based. To the extent part 5 is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part five (5) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code offers far more creditor protection to trusts and their beneficiaries than does the Uniform Trust Code or the Restatement (Third) of Trusts. This is achieved in a number of ways, some of which are enumerated hereafter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Relative to spendthrift trusts, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-503" target="_self">35-15-503</a></cite> contains no exception creditors other than the state of Tennessee, and then only to the extent that a statute of the state of Tennessee so provides. The protection given by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to discretionary trusts is far broader than that provided by the Uniform Trust Code and, unlike under the latter, there are no exception creditors relative to an interest held in a discretionary trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, a discretionary interest held in a trust (a “discretionary trust”) does not require a spendthrift provision in order to gain the protective benefits or attributes of a discretionary interest. Such protective benefits an attributes are inherent in such interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             When combined with the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s definition of what constitutes a discretionary trust, only a limited number of the types of trusts typically used for donative purposes do not obtain the benefit of such creditor protection. This is in keeping with the objective of the Tennessee trust statutes that a settlor should have the broadest freedom to dispose of their assets to whom, and in the manner, they wish (and to only those persons, and in only such manner, as a settlor wishes). Such creditor protection respects that the assets in the trust initially belonged to the settlor and not the beneficiary. When those assets are put in a discretionary trust, the beneficiary obtained only beneficial rights that do not rise to the status of a property interest and, therefore, cannot be reached by creditors, even absent a spendthrift provision. Under the Tennessee trust statutes, an irrevocable special needs trust is shielded from claims by creditors of the settlor regardless of whether or not such trust complies with the provisions of chapter 16, the Tennessee Investment Services Trust Act. Finally, any interest of a beneficiary under a support trust likewise does not rise to the status of a property interest and is therefore protected from creditors, even absent a spendthrift provision.
            </p>
            <p>
             Notwithstanding the above, the Tennessee trust statutes still respect the right of beneficiaries of support and mandatory interests to obtain redress for a trustee’s failure to respect such interests due such beneficiaries under them. However, no creditor of any such beneficiary has such right and can only reach a distribution made from such interests after the distribution is made and then in only specified circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
             The provisions of this part relating to the validity and effect of a spendthrift provision, as well as the rights of certain creditors and assignees to reach a spendthrift trust, or a mandatory, support or discretionary interest, may not be modified by the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite>.

             This part does not generally supersede this state’s exemption statutes nor this state’s Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, T.C.A. title 66, chapter 3, part 3. Nevertheless, certain provisions of this part modify certain provisions of such act.

             Section Comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The section generally describes the overall application of title 35, part 5.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also states that, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by such part 5, a court may authorize a creditor or assignee of the beneficiary to reach the beneficiary’s distribution interest by attachment of present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary or other means.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, it grants such court the discretion to limit any such award to any such creditor or assignee to such relief as is appropriate under the circumstances.
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

             Appellate court construed trust as restraining the voluntary and involuntary transfer of farm property itself, but also as allowing a beneficiary to voluntarily transfer a year's worth of income from the property; thus, that portion of the spendthrift provision pertaining to voluntary alienation of farm income was invalid, and debtor's interest in that income was subject to execution. Atkins v. Marks, 288 S.W.3d 356, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 11, 2008), rehearing denied, 288 S.W.3d 356, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 449 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 15, 2008).

             Section Comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-502" target="_self">35-15-502</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             This section addresses the effects of a spendthrift provision as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, on any type of trust and on any type of beneficial interest under such trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             Spendthrift provisions and the effects thereof are also discussed in other places throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and its comments. Two notable places a reader is directed are; the section comments related to the term “spendthrift provision” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>; and the comments under the heading “Part 5. Creditor’s Claims; Spend-thrift and Discretionary Trusts.” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (a) provides that for a spendthrift provision to be effective under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, it must prohibit both the voluntary and involuntary transfer of the beneficiary’s interest. That is to say, a settlor may not allow a beneficiary to assign while prohibiting a beneficiary’s creditor from collecting, and vice versa. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 58 cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). See also Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 152(2)  (1959). A spendthrift provision valid under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code will also be recognized as valid in a federal bankruptcy proceeding. See <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 541</cite> (c)(2).
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (b) allows a settlor to provide maximum spendthrift protection simply by stating in the instrument that all interests are held subject to a “spendthrift trust” or words of similar effect.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (c) provides that a settlor has the power to restrain the transfer of a beneficiary’s interest, regardless of whether the beneficiary has a beneficial interest in income, in principal, or in both and regardless of whether such interest is or derives from any type of distribution interest (mandatory, support or discretionary) or is a remainder interest. A creditor of the beneficiary is prohibited from attaching a protected interest and may only attempt to collect directly from the beneficiary after payment is made.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (d) provides that a spendthrift provision blocks any creditor or assignee (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “creditor”) of a beneficiary from reaching any interest of such beneficiary, as well as any present, future or prospective distribution at the trust level. Likewise, no creditor can force any distribution from the trust. This remains true despite the fact that a beneficiary under mandatory and support interests may potentially force a distribution under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (e) provides that the existence of any creditor of any beneficiary of a trust with a spendthrift provision in no way impacts any trustee’s, cotrustee’s or other fiduciary’s (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “fiduciary”) right or ability to directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary; and such fiduciary may exhaust a trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. In other words a fiduciary need not make a distribution from a trust subject to a spendthrift provision directly to a beneficiary. Instead such fiduciary has the power to directly pay to a third party any expense for the benefit of such beneficiary and no creditor may reach such payment. If a fiduciary makes such a direct payment, it is not possible for such fiduciary to incur liability to any creditor for so doing. This remains true regardless of the beneficiary for which such payment was made held a mandatory, support, discretionary or remainder interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             A disclaimer, because it is a refusal to accept ownership of an interest and not a transfer of an interest already owned, is not affected by the presence or absence of a spendthrift provision. Most disclaimer statutes expressly provide that the validity of a disclaimer is not affected by a spendthrift protection. See, e.g ., Uniform Probate Code § 2-801(a). Releases and exercises of powers of appointment are also not affected because they are not transfers of property. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 58 cmt. c (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999).
            </p>
            <p>
             Except as otherwise provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505" target="_self">35-15-505</a></cite>, a spendthrift provision is ineffective against a beneficial interest retained by a settlor up to the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for such settlor’s benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
             A valid spendthrift provision makes it impossible for a beneficiary to make a legally binding assignment or transfer, but the appropriate fiduciary may voluntarily choose to honor such beneficiary’s purported assignment or transfer, such being in reality a revocable direction or request to the trustee to pay amounts otherwise distributable to the beneficiary to the purported assignee. Note that under the immediately preceding sentence a beneficiary’s purported assignment relative to a discretionary interest may have little if any practical effect. That is because the amounts “otherwise distributable to the beneficiary” are subject to the trustee’s discretion. An appropriate fiduciary is protected, and is under no liability for, honoring such beneficiary’s request, but must cease doing so upon instruction from such beneficiary. Should an appropriate fiduciary decide to honor such beneficiary’s request, such fiduciary can decide to cease to so honor it and may recommence distributions to the beneficiary at anytime. Moreover, because the beneficiary has not made a binding transfer, such beneficiary can withdraw the beneficiary’s direction but only as to future payments. See  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 58 cmt. d (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 152  cmt. i (1959), but the extent such restatements are in conflict with this paragraph, this paragraph and the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code controls.

             Section Comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-504" target="_self">35-15-504</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             The provisions of this section diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the ex-tent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             This section addresses the effect of a trust (a “discretionary trust”) containing a distribution interest that is a discretionary interest. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code and Restatement (Third) of Trusts, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code maintains the traditional common law distinction between a trust having a discretionary interest (a “discretionary trust”) and a trust having a support interest (a “support trust”).
            </p>
            <p>
             These distinctions and the general effects thereof are also discussed in other places throughout the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and its comments. Two notable places a reader is directed are; the section comments related to the term “discretionary interest” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>; and the comments under the heading “Part 5. Creditor’s Claims; Spendthrift and Discretionary Trusts.” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (a) expresses the traditional common law rule that a discretionary interest under a trust is not  a property interest. Therefore it is not an enforceable right, but only a mere expectancy. Because a discretionary interest is only an unenforceable expectancy and not a property interest, such can in no way “belong” to any beneficiary in their capacity as a beneficiary. The provisions of subsection (a) diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the subsection (a) is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (b) expresses both the traditional common law view regarding the effects of, as well as what is simply the logical outcome of, the fact a discretionary interest is not a property interest, is not an enforceable right and is only an expectancy. The provisions of subsection (b) diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the subsection (b) is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             The traditional common law view regarding the effects of, as well as what is simply the logical outcome of, the fact a discretionary interest is not a property interest, is not an enforceable right and is only an expectancy follow Relative to a discretionary interest:
            </p>
            <p>
             A spendthrift provision is not required in order to gain any protective benefits or attributes of a discretionary interest. Such protective benefits and attributes are inherent in such interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             No creditor or assignee (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “creditor”) has the ability to force or otherwise reach a distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
             No creditor has the ability to force a trustee, cotrustee or other fiduciary (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “fiduciary”) to exercise discretion relative to such interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             The existence of any creditor of any beneficiary in no way impacts a fiduciary’s right or ability to directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary; and such fiduciary may exhaust a trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. In other words a fiduciary need not make a discretionary distribution to a beneficiary. Instead such fiduciary has the power to directly pay to a third party any expense for the benefit of such beneficiary and no creditor may reach such payment. If a fiduciary makes such a direct payment, it is not possible for such fiduciary to incur liability to any creditor for so doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite a beneficiary also being a fiduciary, all of the above holds trust so long as:
            </p>
            <p>
             the beneficiary-fiduciary has no discretion to make or participate in making any distribution to such beneficiary-fiduciary; or
            </p>
            <p>
             the beneficiary-fiduciary has discretion to make or participate in making any distribution to such beneficiary-fiduciary, but such discretion is limited by an ascertainable standard; or
            </p>
            <p>
             the beneficiary-fiduciary has discretion to make or participate in making any distribution to such beneficiary-fiduciary, but such discretion is only exercisable with the consent of another fiduciary or another person having an interest adverse to such beneficiary-fiduciary.
            </p>
            <p>
             In any event, a creditor of a beneficiary-fiduciary cannot compel or otherwise reach a distribution to a greater extent than could such creditor compel or otherwise reach a distribution if the beneficiary was not also acting as a fiduciary.
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

             <p>
              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505" target="_self">35-15-505</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (a)(1) states what is now a well accepted conclusion, that a revocable trust is subject to the claims of the settlor's creditors while the settlor is living. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 25  cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996). Such claims were not allowed at common law, however. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 330  cmt. o (1959).
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (a)(2), provides that a settlor who is also a beneficiary may not use the trust under which they have both capacities as a shield against the settlor's creditors, unless:
             </p>
             <p>
              The settlor establishes an Investment Services Trust pursuant to title 35, chapter 16; or
             </p>
             <p>
              The trust qualifies as an irrevocable special needs trust under subdivisions (a)(3) through (a)(5).
             </p>
             <p>
              Outside of these two exceptions, a creditor of a settlor may reach the maximum amount that the trustee could have paid to the settlor-beneficiary, subject to adjustment should there be more than one (1) settlor. For the general definition of “settlor,” see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Regardless of such general definition of “settlor,” subsections (e) and (f) of this section modify such general definition and expressly provide that persons described in subsections (e) and (f) are not “settlors” for the purposes of subdivision (a)(2), as well as for the purposes of subsection (g).
             </p>
             <p>
              This section does not generally address possible rights against a settlor who was insolvent at the time of the trust's creation or was rendered insolvent by the transfer of property to the trust. This subject is instead left to this state's other applicable laws on fraudulent transfers. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, section (g) hereof modifies certain effects of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c03s66-3-310" target="_blank">66-3-310</a></cite> relative to transfers of property to a spendthrift trust and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c16s35-16-104" target="_self">35-16-104</a></cite> modifies certain effects of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c03s66-3-310" target="_blank">66-3-310</a></cite> relative to transfers of property to a Tennessee Investment Services Trust. Depending on the facts, a transfer to the trust by an insolvent settlor might also constitute a voidable preference under federal bankruptcy law.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivisions (a)(3) — (a)(5) govern the ability of creditors to reach irrevocable special needs trusts, as well the liability of trustees, other fiduciaries and the advisors of irrevocable special needs trusts. Under these subdivisions an irrevocable special needs trust is shielded from claims by creditors of the settlor regardless of whether or not such trust complies with the provisions of chapter 16, the Tennessee Investment Services Trust Act. Moreover, the trustees, other fiduciaries and the advisors of irrevocable special needs trusts are shielded from liability.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (a)(6) recognizes that a revocable trust is usually employed as a will substitute. As such, the trust assets, following the death of the settlor, should be subject to the settlor's debts and other charges. However, in accordance with traditional doctrine, the assets of the settlor's probate estate must normally first be exhausted before the assets of the revocable trust can be reached. This section does not attempt to address the procedural issues raised by the need first to exhaust the decedent's probate estate before reaching the assets of the revocable trust. Subdivision (a)(6), however, does ratify the typical pourover will, revocable trust plan. As long as the rights of the creditor are not impaired, the settlor is free to shift liability from the probate estate to the revocable trust. This section clarifies that claims against revocable trusts are subject to the same time limitations, and are subject to the same order of priority among creditors as are imposed on claims against probate estates. Regarding other issues associated with potential liability of nonprobate assets for unpaid claims, see section 6-102 of the Uniform Probate Code, which was added to that Code in 1998.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (b) deals with powers of withdrawal. As currently contained in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code such subsection is the version originally adopted in 2004 and remains unamended. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, see subsection (e) and the comments to same below. Subsection (e) was adopted with the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, and it overrides the provisions of subsection (b) (for several reasons, including being adopted later in time) as such applies to either subdivision (a)(2) or to subsection (g).
             </p>
             <p>
              On a related note, under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code all powers of ap-pointment, regardless of type, are held by the person to whom such power has been given solely in the capacity of a power holder and not by such power holder in a capacity as settlor. See the definition of “power of appointment” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, as well as the section comments thereunder. Moreover, unlike the Uniform Trust Code, under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code one holding a power of appointment is not a beneficiary. Contrast the definition of “beneficiary” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, as well as the section comments thereunder, with the definition of “beneficiary” in Uniform Trust Code section 103, and the comments thereunder. Under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, definitionally, one holding a power of appointment is neither a settlor nor a beneficiary. They are merely a power holder. Therefore, property held subject to a power of appointment cannot be subject to the claims of the power holder’s creditors. Moreover, in the case of a power of appointment subject to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such power is held under the terms of a trust. Therefore, re-gardless of any allusion or reference thereto in the Restatement (Property) Second: Donative Transfers § 13.2 (1986), powers of appointment that are governed by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code are not subject to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c01s66-1-106" target="_blank">66-1-106</a></cite>. Such section of the Tennessee Code requires that, in order to be subject to such section, any power of appointment must “not be accompanied by any trust,” and any power of appointment under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is so accompanied by a trust. To the extent that any of the above is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such are not precedential or controlling and are rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, which shall control.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (c) provides another exception to the general rule that creditors can reach the settlor's interest under an irrevocable trust to the extent it can be used for the settlor's benefit. Such exception provides that the payment of income taxes on behalf of the settlor of an irrevocable grantor trust will not make the trust available to creditors of the settlor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (d) provides that the donor spouse's successor interests in an inter vivos QTIP trust do not cause the trust to lose spendthrift trust protection as to the donor spouse. Thus, if the donee spouse predeceases the donor spouse, the trust will continue to be a spendthrift trust after the donor spouse becomes a successor beneficiary of the trust.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (e) provides another exception to the general rule that creditors can reach the settlor's interest under an irrevocable trust to the extent it can be used for the settlor's benefit. Such exception provides this by modifying the general definition of “settlor” found in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Subsection(e) expressly provides that a person holding a power of withdrawal is not considered a settlor of a trust by failing to exercise that power or by letting such power lapse. This subsection was added by the 2013 amendments to Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. It overrides the provisions of subsection (b) (for several reasons, including being adopted later in time) as such applies to either subdivision (a)(2) or to subsection (g), discussed below.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (f) likewise by modifies the general definition of “settlor” found in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Subsection (f) provides that a person who becomes a beneficiary of a trust due to the exercise of a power of appointment by someone other than such person is not considered under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to be a settlor of a trust. This is true even if the person who so became the beneficiary created and funded the trust and granted the power of appointment to another. The provisions of subsection (f) apply to subdivision (a)(2). Such subdivision provides the general rule that creditors can reach the settlor's interest under an irrevocable trust to the extent it can be used for the settlor's benefit. Therefore, a person who becomes a beneficiary of a trust due to the exercise of a power of appointment by someone other than such person is not subject to such general rule. Accordingly, if a person who becomes a beneficiary of a trust due to the exercise of a power of appointment by someone other than such person did not otherwise retain a beneficial interest in the trust that was otherwise reachable (e.g., the settlor did not name himself as a beneficiary of the trust at the time it was created), the mere fact that some other person exercises a power of appointment to later make such person a beneficiary will not create an interest that is reachable by the settlor’s creditors. Subsection (f) also applies to subsection (g), discussed below.
             </p>
             <p>
              In general, subsection (g) creates a limitations period relative to contesting the validity of transfers to spendthrift trusts, and is designed to bring certainty to transfers to third party trusts, such certainty being an overriding objective of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
             </p>
             <p>
              Such subsection does not abridge the rights of a creditor to reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit to the extent otherwise provided by this section.
             </p>
             <p>
              Similarly, it does not abridge the ordinary rights of a beneficiary, settlor, cotrustee, trust advisor or trust protector to bring a claim against a trustee or against another cotrustee, trust advisor, trust protector or any of their predecessors relative to trust matters.
             </p>
             <p>
              2007 Amendment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The section was amended to recognize that a settler-beneficiary of an Investment Services Trust is entitled to spendthrift protection under certain circumstances.  The section was amended to further clarify that claims against revocable trusts are subject to the same time limitations, and are subject to the same order of priority among creditors as are imposed on claims against probate estates.  Subdivision (c) provides another exception to the general rule that creditors can reach the settlor’s interest under an irrevocable trust to the extent it can be used for the settlor’s benefit.   The exception provides that the payment of income taxes on behalf of the settlor of an irrevocable grantor trust will not make the trust available to creditors of the settlor.
             </p>
             <p>
              2010 Amendment.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section was amended to recognize that disabled persons who are beneficiaries of certain special needs trusts are entitled to spendthrift trust protection.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (d) was added in 2010. This subsection provides that the donor spouse’s successor interests in an inter vivos qtip trust do not cause the trust to lose spendthrift trust protection as to the donor spouse.  Thus, if the donee spouse predeceases the donor spouse, the trust will continue to be a spendthrift trust after the donor spouse becomes a successor beneficiary of the trust.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

             Section Comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-506" target="_self">35-15-506</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             This section addresses the respective rights of creditors and beneficiaries relative to distributions from support, mandatory and certain remainder interests.
            </p>
            <p>
             The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (a) only applies to support interests, and it applies to such interests regardless of whether or not the trust creating such interests contains a spendthrift provision. Relative to a support interest:
            </p>
            <p>
             Such support interest is not  a property interest. This is true even though a beneficiary of a support interest has certain enforceable rights as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             A spendthrift provision is not required in order to gain any protective benefits or attributes of a support interest. Such protective benefits an attributes are inherent in such interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             No creditor or assignee (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “creditor”) has the ability to force or otherwise reach a support interest until a distribution from such interest is actually made to a beneficiary.
            </p>

             Even after such distribution from a support interest is made to a beneficiary, a creditor can only reach that portion of such distribution that exceeds the amount necessary for the health, education, maintenance and support of such beneficiary who received such distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
             No beneficiary holding a support interest can transfer the use or enjoyment of property belonging to the trust. Moreover, no such use or enjoyment of property may be reached the creditors of such beneficiary.
            </p>
            <p>
             The existence of any creditor of any beneficiary in no way impacts the right or ability of a trustee, cotrustee or other fiduciary (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “fiduciary”) of a support interest to directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary; and such fiduciary may exhaust a trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. In other words a fiduciary need not make a distribution under a support interest to a beneficiary. Instead such fiduciary has the power to directly pay to a third party for any expense for the benefit of such beneficiary and no creditor may reach such payment. If a fiduciary makes such a direct payment, it is not possible for such fiduciary to incur liability to any creditor for so doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (b) only applies to mandatory interests, and it applies to such interests regardless of whether or not the trust creating such interests contains a spendthrift provision. Relative to a mandatory interest:
            </p>
            <p>
             A court can only order a fiduciary to distribute any past due mandatory distribution to the beneficiary of that mandatory distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
             A court cannot order a fiduciary to distribute such past due mandatory distribution directly to a creditor.
            </p>
            <p>
             The existence of any creditor of any beneficiary in no way impacts the right or ability of a fiduciary of a mandatory interest to directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary; and such fiduciary may exhaust a trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. In other words a fiduciary need not make a distribution under a mandatory interest to a beneficiary. Instead such fiduciary has the power to directly pay to a third party for any expense for the benefit of such beneficiary and no creditor may reach such payment. If a fiduciary makes such a direct payment, it is not possible for such fiduciary to incur liability to any creditor for so doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (c) only applies to remainder interests. Relative to a mandatory interest:
            </p>
            <p>
             Although a remainder interest may be an enforceable right, unless it is absolutely certain based on the language of the trust that such interest will be distributed within one (1) year, it is not a property interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             Regardless, subsection (c) does not affect eligibility for any public assistance program administered by the department of human services.

            Because the beneficiaries of the trust hold the beneficial interest in the trust property and the trustee holds only legal title without the benefits of ownership, the creditors of the trustee have only a personal claim against the trustee. See Restatement (Third) § 5 cmt. k (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 12  cmt. a (1959). Similarly, a personal creditor of the trustee who attaches trust property to satisfy the debt does not acquire title as a bona fide purchaser even if the creditor is unaware of the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 308  (1959). The protection afforded by this section is consistent with that provided by the Bankruptcy Code. Property in which the trustee holds legal title as trustee is not part of the trustee’s bankruptcy estate. <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 541</cite> (d).
           </p>
           <p>
            The exemption of the trust property from the personal obligations of the trustee is the most significant feature of Anglo-American trust law by comparison with the devices (e.g., fideicomisos, private foundations) available in civil law countries. A principal objective of the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition is to protect the Anglo-American trust with respect to transactions in civil law countries. See  Hague Convention art. 11. See also  Henry Hansmann &amp; Ugo Mattei, The Functions of Trust Law: A Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis, 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 434 (1998) ; John H. Langbein, The Secret Life of the Trust: The Trust as an Instrument of Commerce, 107 Yale L.J. 165, 179-80 (1997) . Notwithstanding the above, it is important to note that the United States has not (as of May 2013) ratified such convention. Therefore, although such convention may be binding on the member-states who have ratified it, such convention has no force and effect on the United States, any state or this state (as such terms are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>).
           </p>
           <p>
            Notwithstanding that the United States has not ratified this treaty, (as of May 2013) such convention has been fully or partially entered into force by the following member-states whose legal systems are based all or in part on civil law: Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, San Marino and Switzerland. Therefore these countries are highly likely to be influenced by the treaty relative to their respective honoring of trusts.

             This section adds further creditor protection to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in two cases covered in subsections (a) and (b), respectively.

            <p>
             This section has no similar provision in the Uniform Trust Code. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (a) provides that No creditor or assignee (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “creditor”) of a beneficiary can reach the interest of any beneficiary or other person who holds any power to remove or replace any trustee, cotrustee or other fiduciary (hereinafter in the comments to this section, individually and collectively, simply “fiduciary”). Such power is personal to the holder solely in their capacity as its holder and not as a beneficiary or other person having a relationship to the trust. The preceding also has the effect that no court can force any such holder to exercise such power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (b) provides that, subject to the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-504ol1b5" target="_self">35-15-504(b)(5)</a></cite> (regarding beneficiaries under discretionary interests also serving as a fiduciary), the fact that a beneficiary is also serving as a fiduciary in no way lessens the creditor protection offered by the various provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, even to the extent that no court may foreclose on any such beneficiary-fiduciary’s interest.

            The capacity required to create, amend, revoke, or add property to a revocable trust, or to direct the actions of the trustee of a revocable trust, is the same as that required to make a will. To be effective as a post death disposition of property transferred during the transferor's life or by the transferor's will to a trust of which the transferor is the settlor or deemed to be the settlor, neither a revocable nor irrevocable trust existing on or executed after July 1, 2004, has to be executed with the formalities of a will.

             The provisions of this part in some ways diverge from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this part is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

             This part deals with issues of significance not totally settled under prior law. Because of the widespread use in re-cent years of the revocable trust as an alternative to a will, this short part is one of the more important parts of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. This part and the other parts of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code treat the revocable trust as the functional equivalent of a will. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-601" target="_self">35-15-601</a></cite> provides that the capacity standard for wills applies in deter-mining whether the settlor had capacity to create a revocable trust. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>, after providing that a trust is presumed revocable unless stated otherwise, prescribes the procedure for revocation or amendment, whether the trust contains one or several settlors. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite> provides that while a trust is revocable and the settlor has capacity, the rights of the beneficiaries are subject to the settlor's control. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604" target="_self">35-15-604</a></cite> prescribes a statute of limitations on contest of revocable trusts.

            <p>
             This section is patterned after Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 11(1) (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996). The revocable trust is used primarily as a will substitute, with its key provision being the determination of the persons to receive the trust property upon the settlor's death. To solidify the use of the revocable trust as a device for transferring property at death, the settlor usually also executes a pourover will. The use of a pourover will assures that property not transferred to the trust during life will be combined with the property the settlor did manage to convey. Given this primary use of the revocable trust as a device for disposing of property at death, the capacity standard for wills rather than that for lifetime gifts should apply. The application of the capacity standard for wills does not mean that the revocable trust must be executed with the formalities of a will. Moreover, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code (unlike the law of some states, e.g., Florida), statutorily states in this section that neither a revocable or irrevocable trust (pour-over or non-pour-over), even one containing testamentary dispositions, need be made with the formalities of a will.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are no execution requirements under this Code for a trust not created by will, and a trust not containing real property may be created by an oral statement. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-407" target="_self">35-15-407</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not explicitly spell out the standard of capacity necessary to create other types of trusts, although T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite> does require that the settlor have capacity. This section includes a capacity standard for creation of a revocable trust because of the uncertainty in the case law and the importance of the issue in modern estate planning. No such uncertainty exists with respect to the capacity standard for other types of trusts. To create a testamentary trust, the settlor must have the capacity to make a will. To create an irrevocable trust, the settlor must have the capacity that would be needed to transfer the property free of trust. See generally Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 11 (Tentative Draft No. 1, approved 1996); Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 8.1 (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001).

             Because the trust did not specify that the method for modification provided in the trust was exclusive, the trial court was correct to consider whether the settlor's handwritten notations manifested clear and convincing evidence of the settlor's intent to modify the trust. In re Elizabeth Beck Hoisington Living Trust, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 700 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2017).

             Trial court correctly ordered a trust res to be distributed in accordance with the original unannotated document because the settlor's holographic notations were not sufficient to manifest a clear intent to modify her trust; the settlor did not make her changes in a separate instrument, she did not sign or initial her handwritten changes, and she did not communicate her changes to anyone or deliver a copy of the annotated trust document to another person.

             Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             The provisions of this section in some ways diverge from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (a), which provides that a settlor may revoke or modify a trust unless the terms of the trust expressly state that the trust is irrevocable, changes the common law. After its effective date of July 1, 2004, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code reverses the traditional common law rule that a trust is presumed irrevocable absent evidence of contrary intent. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 330  (1959). The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code presumes irrevocability when the instrument is silent because the instrument was likely drafted by a nonprofessional, who intended the trust as a will substitute. The most recent revision of the Restatement of Trusts similarly reverses the former approach. A trust is presumed revocable if the settlor has retained a beneficial interest. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 63 cmt. c (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001). Because professional drafters habitually spell out whether or not a trust is revocable, subsection (a) will have limited application.
            </p>
            <p>
             A power of revocation includes the power to amend. An unrestricted power to amend may also include the power to revoke a trust. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 63 cmt. g (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 331  cmt. g & h (1959).
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (b), differs from the Uniform Trust Code regarding default rules for revocation or amendment of a trust having several settlors. The settlor's authority to revoke or modify the trust depends on whether the trust contains community property. To the extent the trust contains community property, the trust may be revoked by either spouse acting alone but may be amended only by joint action of both spouses. The purpose of this provision, and the reason for the use of joint trusts in community property states, is to preserve the community character of property transferred to the trust. While Tennessee is not a community property, contributions of community property to trusts created in noncommunity property states do occur. This is due to the mobility of settlors, and the fact that community property retains its community character when a couple moves from a community to a noncommunity state.
            </p>
            <p>
             With respect to separate property contributed to the trust, or all property of the trust if none of the trust property consists of community property, subsection (b) provides that each settlor may revoke or amend the trust as to the por-tion of the trust contributed by that settlor. The rule is included because of the increasing use of joint trusts in noncom-munity property states in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (b) does not address the many technical issues that can arise in determining the settlors' proportionate contribution to a joint trust. Most problematic are contributions of jointly-owned property. In the case of joint tenancies in real estate, each spouse would presumably be treated as having made an equal contribution because of the right to sever the interest and convert it into a tenancy in common. This is in contrast to joint accounts in financial institutions, ownership of which in most states is based not on fractional interest but on actual dollar contribution. See, e.g. , Uniform Probate Code § 6-211. Most difficult may be determining a contribution rule for entireties property.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, subdivision (b)(3) does not explicitly require that the other settlor or settlors be notified if a joint trust is revoked by less than all of the settlors., but such notice would be required pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>. While a trust is revocable and the settlor has capacity, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>(a) provides that the duties of the trustee, including the duty to keep the beneficiaries informed of administrative developments, are owed exclusively to the settlor. With respect to trusts having several settlors, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603ol1b" target="_self">35-15-603(b)</a></cite> clarifies that the trustee's duties, including the duty to keep the certain beneficiaries informed of developments, are owed to all settlors having capacity. Notifying the other settlor or settlors of the revocation or amendment will place them in a better position to protect their interests. If the revocation or amendment by less than all of the settlors breaches an implied agreement not to revoke or amend the trust, those harmed by the action can sue for breach of contract. If the trustee fails to notify the other settlor or settlors of the revocation or amendment, the parties aggrieved by the trustee's failure can sue the trustee for breach of trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (c), which is similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 63  cmt. h & i (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), specifies the method of revocation and amendment. Revocation of a trust differs fundamentally from revocation of a will. Revocation of a will, because a will is not effective until death, cannot affect an existing fiduciary relationship. With a trust, however, because a revocation will terminate an already existing fiduciary relationship, there is a need to protect a trustee who might act without knowledge that the trust has been revoked. There is also a need to protect trustees against the risk that they will misperceive the settlor's intent and mistakenly assume that an informal document or communication constitutes a revocation when that was not in fact the settlor's intent. To protect trustees against these risks, drafters habitually insert provisions providing that a revocable trust may be revoked only by delivery to the trustee of a formal revoking document. Some courts require strict compliance with the stated formalities. Other courts, recognizing that the formalities were inserted primarily for the trustee's and not the settlor's benefit, will accept other methods of revocation as long as the settlor's intent is clear. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 63  Reporter's Notes to cmt. h-j (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001).
            </p>
            <p>
             The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code tries to effectuate the settlor's intent to the maximum extent possible while at the same time protecting a trustee against inadvertent liability. While notice to the trustee of a revocation is good practice, this section does not make the giving of such notice a prerequisite to a trust's revocation. To protect a trustee who has not been notified of a revocation or amendment, subsection (g) provides that a trustee who does not know that a trust has been revoked or amended is not liable to the settlor or settlor's successors in interest for distributions made and other actions taken on the assumption that the trust, as unamended, was still in effect. However, to honor the settlor's intent, subsection (c) generally honors a settlor's clear expression of intent even if inconsistent with stated formalities in the terms of the trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under subsection (c), the settlor may revoke or amend a revocable trust by substantial compliance with the method specified in the terms of the trust or by a later will or codicil or any other method manifesting clear and convincing evidence of the settlor's intent. Only if the method specified in the terms of the trust is made exclusive is use of the other methods prohibited. Even then, a failure to comply with a technical requirement, such as required notarization, may be excused as long as compliance with the method specified in the terms of the trust is otherwise substantial.
            </p>
            <p>
             While revocation of a trust will ordinarily continue to be accomplished by signing and delivering a written document to the trustee, other methods, such as a physical act or an oral statement coupled with a withdrawal of the property, might also demonstrate the necessary intent. These less formal methods, because they provide less reliable indicia of intent, will often be insufficient, however. The method specified in the terms of the trust is a reliable safe harbor and should be followed whenever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Revocation or amendment by will is mentioned in subsection (c) not to encourage the practice but to make clear that it is not precluded by omission. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Will and Other Donative Transfers § 7.2 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), which validates revocation or amendment of will substitutes by later will. Situations do arise, particularly in death-bed cases, where revocation by will may be the only practicable method. In such cases, a will, a solemn document executed with a high level of formality, may be the most reliable method for expressing intent. A revocation in a will ordinarily becomes effective only upon probate of the will following the testator's death. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 63  Reporter's Notes to cmt. h-i (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001).
            </p>
            <p>
             A residuary clause in a will disposing of the estate differently than the trust is alone insufficient to revoke or amend a trust. The provision in the will must either be express or the will must dispose of specific assets contrary to the terms of the trust. The substantial body of law on revocation of Totten trusts by will offers helpful guidance. The authority is collected in William H. Danne, Jr., Revocation of Tentative (“Totten”) Trust of Savings Bank Account by Inter Vivos Declaration or Will, <cite class="alr">46 A.L.R. 3</cite>d 487 (1972) .
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (c) does not require that a trustee concur in the revocation or amendment of a trust. Such a concurrence would be necessary only if required by the terms of the trust. If the trustee concludes that an amendment unacceptably changes the trustee's duties, the trustee may resign as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (d), providing that upon revocation the trust property is to be distributed as the settlor directs, codifies a provision commonly included in revocable trust instruments. If the trust contains community property, the trustee is required on revocation to distribute the property one-half (1/2) to each spouse unless the instrument directs otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
             A settlor's power to revoke is not terminated by the settlor's incapacity. The power to revoke may instead be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney as authorized in subsection (e), by a conservator or guardian as authorized in subsection (f), or by the settlor personally if the settlor regains capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (e), which is similar to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 63 cmt. l (Tentative Draft No. 3, approved 2001), authorizes an agent under a power of attorney to revoke or modify a revocable trust only to the extent the terms of the trust or power of attorney expressly so permit. An express provision is required because most settlors usually intend that the revocable trust, and not the power of attorney, to function as the settlor's principal property management device. The power of attorney is usually intended as a backup for assets not transferred to the revocable trust or to ad-dress specific topics, such as the power to sign tax returns or apply for government benefits, which may be beyond the authority of a trustee or are not customarily granted to a trustee.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (f) addresses the authority of a conservator to revoke or amend a revocable trust. Under Tennessee law a “conservator” is appointed by the court to manage the ward's party and to make decisions with respect to the ward's personal affairs. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Consequently, subsection (f) authorizes a conservator to exercise a settlor's power to revoke or amend a trust only if the instrument authorizes a conservator to have that power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Steps a conservator can take to stem possible abuse is not limited to petitioning to revoke the trust. The conservator could petition for removal of the trustee under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite>. The conservator, acting on the settlor-beneficiary's behalf, could also bring an action to enforce the trust according to its terms. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite>, a conservator may act on behalf of the beneficiary whose estate the conservator controls whenever a consent or other action by the beneficiary is required or may be given under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

             Section Comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             This section has the effect of postponing enforcement of the rights of the beneficiaries of a revocable trust until the death or incapacity of the settlor or other person holding the power to revoke the trust. This section thus recognizes that the settlor of a revocable trust is in control of the trust and should have the right to enforce the trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pursuant to this section, the duty under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite> to inform and report to beneficiaries is owed to the settlor of a revocable trust as long as the settlor has capacity. In the case of a trust having several settlors, subsection (b) clarifies that this duty extends to all settlors having capacity. Should fewer than all settlors revoke or modify their pportionof the trust, the trustee must notify the other settlor or settlors of the action. See the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the settlor loses capacity, subsection (a) no longer applies, with the consequence that the rights of the beneficiaries are no longer subject to the settlor's control. Certain beneficiaries are entitled to request information concerning the trust and the trustee must provide the beneficiaries with such information as may be required under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>. However, because this section (and unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, significant portions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>) may be freely overridden in the terms of the trust (and relative to T.C.A. § 35-15-813 also by a writing of a settlor, a trust advisor or trust protector), a settlor is (and in some cases others are) free to deny the beneficiaries these rights, even to the point of directing the trustee not to inform them of the existence of the trust. Also, should an incapacitated settlor later regain capacity, the beneficiaries' rights will again be subject to the settlor's control. The cessation of the settlor's control upon the settlor's incapacity or death does not mean that the beneficiaries may reopen transactions the settlor approved while having capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Typically, the settlor of a revocable trust will also be the sole or primary beneficiary of the trust. Upon the settlor's incapacity, any right of action the settlor-trustee may have against the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty will pass to the settlor's agent or conservator.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (c) makes clear that a holder of a power of withdrawal has the same powers over the trust as the settlor of a revocable trust. Equal treatment is warranted due to the holder's equivalent power to control the trust. For the definition of power of withdrawal, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.

             Dismissal of lawsuit to set aside a decedent's trust was inappropriate because the trial court erred in applying the statute of limitations for a breach of fiduciary duty as the complainant alleged lack of capacity and undue influence, but did not allege that the trustees were acting in a fiduciary capacity at the time of signing. Furthermore, the lawsuit was timely filed under the correct statute of limitations within two years after decedent's death, as there was no indication that the complainant was provided a copy of the trust instrument.

             Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-604" target="_self">35-15-604</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             This section provides finality to the question of when a contest of a revocable trust may be brought. The section is designed to allow an adequate time in which to bring a contest while at the same time permitting the expeditious distribution of the trust property following the settlor's death. The two (2) years is the same statute of limitations on contesting a will admitted to probate in common form.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provides that a no-contest (or similar) provision will generally be enforced according to its terms. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1014" target="_self">35-15-1014</a></cite>. Subject to such section, a trust can be contested on a variety of grounds. For example, the contestant may allege that no trust was created due to lack of intent to create a trust or lack of capacity (see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-402" target="_self">35-15-402</a></cite>), that undue influence, duress, or fraud was involved in the trust's creation (see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-406" target="_self">35-15-406</a></cite>), or that the trust had been revoked or modified (see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>). A “contest” is an action to invalidate all or part of the terms of the trust or of property transfers to the trustee. An action against a beneficiary or other person for intentional interference with an inheritance or gift, not being a contest, is not subject to this section. For the law on intentional interference, see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 774B  (1979). Nor does this section preclude an action to determine the validity of a trust that is brought during the settlor's lifetime, such as a petition for a declaratory judgment, if such action is authorized by other law. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106" target="_self">35-15-106</a></cite> (Tennessee Uniform Trust Code supplemented by common law of trusts and principles of equity, subject to the exceptions contained in such section).
            </p>
            <p>
             This section applies only to a revocable trust that becomes irrevocable by reason of the settlor's death. A trust that became irrevocable by reason of the settlor's lifetime release of the power to revoke is outside its scope. A revocable trust does not become irrevocable upon a settlor's loss of capacity. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>, the power to revoke may be exercised by the settlor's agent, conservator, or guardian, or personally by the settlor if the settlor regains capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Subsection (a) specifies a time limit on when a contest can be brought. A contest is barred upon the first to occur of two possible events. The maximum possible time for bringing a contest is two (2) years from the settlor's death. This should provide potential contestants with ample time in which to determine whether they have an interest that will be affected by the trust, even if formal notice of the trust is lacking. A trustee who wishes to shorten the contest period may do so by giving notice. Subdivision (a)(2) bars a contest by a potential contestant one hundred twenty (120) days after the date the trustee sent that person a copy of the trust instrument and informed the person of the trust's existence, of the trustee's name and address, and of the time allowed for commencing a contest. The one hundred twenty (120) day period in subdivision (a)(2) is subordinate to the two-year bar in subdivision (a)(1). A contest is automatically barred two (2) years after the settlor's death even if notice is sent by the trustee less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the end of that period.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because only a small minority of trusts are actually contested, trustees should not be restrained from making distributions because of concern about possible liability should a contest later be filed. Absent a protective statute, a trustee is ordinarily absolutely liable for misdelivery of the trust assets, even if the trustee reasonably believed that the distribution was proper. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 226 (1959). Subsection (b) addresses liability concerns by allowing the trustee, upon the settlor's death, to proceed expeditiously to distribute the trust property. The trustee may distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust until and unless the trustee receives notice of a pending judicial proceeding contesting the validity of the trust, or until notified by a potential contestant of a possible contest, followed by its filing within sixty (60) days.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even though a distribution in compliance with subsection (b) discharges the trustee from potential liability, subsection (c) makes the beneficiaries of what later turns out to have been an invalid trust liable to return any distribution received. Issues as to whether the distribution must be returned with interest, or with income earned or profit made are not addressed in this section but are left to the law of restitution.
            </p>
            <p>
             For purposes of notices under this section, the substitute representation principles of part 3 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> -- <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite>] are applicable. The notice by the trustee under subdivision (a)(2) or by a potential contestant under subdivision (b)(2) must be given in a manner reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to result in its receipt. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-109" target="_self">35-15-109</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
             This section does not address possible liability for the debts of the deceased settlor or a trustee's possible liability to creditors for distributing trust assets. For possible liability of the trust, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505" target="_self">35-15-505</a></cite> and its Section Comment.

             <p>
              This section, which specifies the requirements for a valid acceptance of the trusteeship, implicates many of the same issues that arise in determining whether a trust has been revoked. Consequently, the two provisions track each other closely. Compare subsection 701(a), with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602ol1c" target="_self">35-15-602(c)</a></cite> (procedure for revoking or modifying trust). Procedures specified in the terms of the trust are recognized, but only substantial, not literal compliance is required. A failure to meet technical requirements, such as notarization of the trustee's signature, does not result in a failure to accept. Ordinarily, the trustee will indicate acceptance by signing the trust instrument or signing a separate written instrument. However, this section validates any other method demonstrating the necessary intent, such as by knowingly exercising trustee powers, unless the terms of the trust make the specified method exclusive. This section also does not preclude an acceptance by estoppel. For general background on issues relating to trustee acceptance and rejection, see Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 35 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 102 (1959). Consistent with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-201ol1b" target="_self">35-15-201(b)</a></cite>, which emphasizes that continuing judicial supervision of a trust is the rare exception, not the rule, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not require that a trustee qualify in court.
             </p>
             <p>
              To avoid the inaction that can result if the person designated as trustee fails to communicate a decision either to accept or to reject the trusteeship, subsection (b) provides that a failure to accept within a reasonable time constitutes a rejection of the trusteeship. What will constitute a reasonable time depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code considers such facts and circumstances to include knowledge by the person designated trustee of both such designation and of the assets comprising the trust.
             </p>
             <p>
              A major consideration is possible harm that might occur if a vacancy in a trusteeship is not filled in a timely manner. A trustee's rejection normally precludes a later acceptance but does not cause the trust to fail. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 35 cmt. c (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). Regarding the filling of a vacancy in the event of a rejection, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              A person designated as trustee who decides not to accept the trusteeship need not provide a formal rejection, but a clear and early communication is recommended. The appropriate recipient of the rejection depends upon the circumstances. Ordinarily, it would be appropriate to communicate the rejection to the person who informed the designee of the proposed trusteeship. If judicial proceedings involving the trust are pending, the rejection could be filed with the court. In the case of a person named as trustee of a revocable trust, it would be appropriate to communicate the rejection to the settlor. In any event, it would be best to inform a beneficiary with a significant interest in the trust because that beneficiary might be more motivated than others to seek appointment of a new trustee.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (c)(1) makes clear that a nominated trustee may act expeditiously to protect the trust property without being considered to have accepted the trusteeship. However, upon conclusion of the intervention, the nominated trustee must send a rejection of office to the settlor, if living and competent, otherwise to a qualified beneficiary.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because of the potential liability that can inhere in trusteeship, subdivision (c)(2) allows a person designated as trustee to inspect the trust property without accepting the trusteeship. The condition of real property is a particular concern, including possible tort liability for the condition of the premises or liability for violation of state or federal environmental laws such as CERCLA, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 9607</cite>. For a provision limiting a trustee's personal liability for obligations arising from ownership or control of trust property, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite>.

              Section Comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              This provision is consistent with the Restatement Third and with the bonding provisions of the Uniform Probate Code. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 34(3) and cmt. a (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Uniform Probate Code §§ 3-604 (personal representatives), 5-415 (conservators), and 7-304 (trustees). Because a bond is required only if the terms of the trust require bond or a bond is found by the court to be necessary to protect the interests of beneficiaries, bond should rarely be required under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
             </p>
             <p>
              Despite the ability of the court pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> to override a term of the trust waiving bond, the court should order bond in such cases only for good reasons. Similarly, the court should rarely dispense with bond if the settlor directed that the trustee give bond.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section does not attempt to detail all of the technical bonding requirements that the court may impose. Typical requirements are listed in the Uniform Probate Code sections cited above. The amount of a bond otherwise required may be reduced by the value of trust property deposited in a manner that prevents its unauthorized disposition, and by the value of real property which the trustee, by express limitation of power, lacks power to convey without court authorization. The amount of bond otherwise required of a trustee acting as such in a directed trust setting may also depend on the extent to which such trustee is an excluded fiduciary relative to any such trustee’s powers and duties. Similarly a court is mandated to consider such matters when considering the requirements of bonds for all fiduciaries other than a trustee. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-712" target="_self">35-15-712</a></cite>. Also, the court may excuse or otherwise modify a requirement of a bond, reduce or increase the amount of a bond, release a surety, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.
             </p>
             <p>
              T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-702ol1c" target="_self">35-15-702(c)</a></cite> clarifies that a state or nationally regulated bank, savings institution or trust company authorized to exercise fiduciary powers need not provide bond for individual trusts. Such institutions must meet detailed financial responsibility requirements in order to do trust business in the state, thereby obviating the need to post bonds in individual trusts.

               Section Comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section contains most but not all of the Code's provisions on cotrustees. Other provisions relevant to cotrustees include sections T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> (vacancy in trusteeship need not be filled if cotrustee remains in office), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite> (notice of resignation must be given to cotrustee), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite> (lack of cooperation among cotrustees as ground for removal), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-707" target="_self">35-15-707</a></cite> (obligations of resigning or removed trustee), , and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> (whether all or less than all trustees are required to exercise signature authority to exercise various powers).
              </p>
              <p>
               Cotrustees are appointed for a variety of reasons. Having multiple decision makers can serve as a safeguard against eccentricity or misconduct. Cotrustees are often appointed to gain the advantage of differing skills, perhaps a financial institution for its permanence and professional skills, and a family member to maintain a personal connection with the beneficiaries. On other occasions, cotrustees are appointed to make certain that all family lines are represented in the trust's management.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cotrusteeship should not be called for without careful reflection. Division of responsibility among cotrustees is of-ten confused, the accountability of any individual trustee is uncertain, obtaining consent of all trustees can be burden-some, and unless an odd number of trustees is named deadlocks requiring court resolution can occur. Potential problems can be reduced by addressing division of responsibilities in the terms of the trust. Like the other sections of this chapter, this section is freely subject to modification in the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Much of this section is based on comparable provisions of the Restatement of Trusts, although with extensive modifications. Reference should also be made to ERISA section 405 ( <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 1105</cite>), which in recent years has been the statutory base for the most significant case law on the powers and duties of cotrustees.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-703" target="_self">35-15-703</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) is in accord with Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 39 (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999), which rejects the common law rule, followed in earlier Restatements, requiring unanimity among the trustees of a private trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 194 (1959). This section is consistent with the prior Restatement rule applicable to charitable trusts, which allowed for action by a majority of trustees. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 383 (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               Under subsection (b), a majority of the remaining trustees may act for the trust when a vacancy occurs in a cotrusteeship. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> provides that a vacancy in a cotrusteeship need be filled only if there is no trustee remaining in office.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pursuant to subsection (c), a cotrustee must participate in the performance of a trustee function unless the cotrustee has properly delegated performance to another cotrustee, or the cotrustee is unable to participate due to temporary incapacity or disqualification under other law. Other laws under which a cotrustee might be disqualified include federal securities law and the ERISA prohibited transactions rules. Subsection (d) authorizes a cotrustee to assume some or all of the functions of another trustee who is unavailable to perform duties as provided in subsection (c).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (e) addresses the extent to which a trustee may delegate the performance of functions to a cotrustee. The standard differs from the standard for delegation to an agent as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807" target="_self">35-15-807</a></cite> because the two situations are different. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807" target="_self">35-15-807</a></cite>, which is substantially similar to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111" target="_self">35-14-111</a></cite> of the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002, recognizes that many trustees are not professionals. Consequently, trustees should be encouraged to delegate functions they are not competent to perform. Subsection (e) is premised on the assumption that the settlor selected cotrustees for a specific reason and that this reason ought to control the scope of a permitted delegation to a cotrustee. Subsection (e) prohibits a trustee from delegating to another trustee functions the settlor reasonably expected the trustees to perform jointly. The exact extent to which a trustee may delegate functions to another trustee in a particular case will vary depending on the reasons the settlor decided to appoint cotrustees. The better practice is to address the division of functions in the terms of the trust, as allowed by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. Subsection (e) is based on language derived from Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 171 (1959). This section of the Restatement Second, which applied to delegations to both agents and cotrustees, was superseded, as to delegation to agents, by Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 171 (1992).
              </p>
              <p>
               By permitting the trustees to act by a majority, this section contemplates that there may be a trustee or trustees who might dissent. Trustees who dissent from the acts of a cotrustee are in general protected from liability. Subsection (f) protects trustees who refused to join in the action. Subsection (h) protects a dissenting trustee who joined the action at the direction of the majority, such as to satisfy a demand of the other side to a transaction, if the trustee expressed the dissent to a cotrustee at or before the time of the action in question. However, the protections provided by subsections (f) and (h) no longer apply if the action constitutes a serious breach of trust. In that event, subsection (g) may impose liability against a dissenting trustee for failing to take reasonable steps to rectify the improper conduct. The responsibility to take action against a breaching cotrustee codifies the substance of sections 184 and 224 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               A cotrustee can always seek declaratory relief under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c14s29-14-105" target="_blank">29-14-105</a></cite> when a deadlock exists among trustees or when a dissenting cotrustee fears that an action or omission of the majority could result in potential liability to the co-trustee.
              </p>
              <p>
               A provision similar to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-703ol1i" target="_self">35-15-703(i)</a></cite> is not contained in the Uniform Trust Code. Subsection (i) requires all trustees to keep all other fiduciaries reasonably informed about the administration of the trust to the extent such other fiduciaries do not have such knowledge. This requirement assures that all such fiduciaries have the material information necessary to perform their respective duties.
              </p>

              Section Comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section lists the ways in which a trusteeship becomes vacant and the rules on filling the vacancy. See also T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite> (accepting or declining trusteeship), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705ol1resignation" target="_self">35-15-705 (resignation)</a></cite>, and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706ol1removal" target="_self">35-15-706 (removal)</a></cite>. Good drafting practice suggests that the terms of the trust deal expressly with the problem of vacancies, naming successors and specifying the procedure for filling vacancies. This section applies only if the terms of the trust fail to specify a procedure.
             </p>
             <p>
              The disqualification of a trustee referred to in subdivision (a)(4) would include a financial institution whose right to engage in trust business has been revoked or removed. Such disqualification might also occur if the trust's principal place of administration is transferred to a jurisdiction in which the trustee, whether an individual or institution, is not qualified to act.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (b) provides that a vacancy in the cotrusteeship must be filled only if the trust has no remaining trustee. If a vacancy in the cotrusteeship is not filled, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-703" target="_self">35-15-703</a></cite> authorizes the remaining cotrustees to continue to administer the trust. However, as provided in subsection (e), the court, exercising its inherent equity authority, may al-ways appoint additional trustees if the appointment would promote better administration of the trust. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 34 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 108 cmt. e (1959).
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (c) provides a procedure for filling a vacancy in the trusteeship of a noncharitable trust. Absent an effective provision in the terms of the trust, subdivision (c)(2) permits a vacancy in the trusteeship to be filled, without the need for court approval, by a person selected by unanimous agreement of the qualified beneficiaries. An effective provision in the terms of the trust for the designation of a successor trustee includes a procedure under which the successor trustee is selected by a person designated in those terms. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite>, the qualified beneficiaries may also receive the trustee's resignation. If a trustee resigns following notice as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705" target="_self">35-15-705</a></cite>, the trust may be transferred to a successor appointed pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) of this section, all without court involvement. Unlike with the Uniform Trust Code, only a qualified (and not any nonqualified) beneficiary who is displeased with the choice of the qualified beneficiaries may petition the court for removal of the trustee under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite>. Under such section, a settlor or cotrustee may also so petition for removal
             </p>
             <p>
              If the qualified beneficiaries fail to make an appointment, subdivision (c)(3) authorizes the court to fill the vacancy. In making the appointment, the court should consider the objectives and probable intention of the settlor, the promotion of the proper administration of the trust, and the interests and wishes of the beneficiaries. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 34 cmt. f (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 108 cmt. d (1959).
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (d) specifies a procedure for filling a vacancy in the trusteeship of a charitable trust. Absent an effective designation in the terms of the trusts, a successor trustee may be selected by the charitable organizations expressly designated to receive distributions in the terms of the trusts if the attorney general does not affirmatively object within thirty days of receipt of the notice of the person selected. This is a different procedure than under the Uniform Trust Code, which requires the attorney general to actively concur. If the attorney general objects within the specified time frame, or if the trust does not designate a charitable organization to receive distributions, the vacancy may be filled only by a court.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the case of a revocable trust, the appointment of a successor will normally be made directly by the settlor. As to the duties of a successor trustee with respect to the actions of a predecessor, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-812" target="_self">35-15-812</a></cite>.

              Section Comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section rejects the common law rule that a trustee may resign only with permission of the court, and goes further than the Restatements, which allow a trustee to resign with the consent of the beneficiaries. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 36 (Tentative Draft No.2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 106 (1959). Concluding that the default rule ought to approximate standard drafting practice, the drafting committee provided in subsection (a) that a trustee may resign by giving notice to the qualified beneficiaries, a living settlor, and any cotrustee. A resigning trustee may also follow the traditional method and resign with approval of the court.
             </p>
             <p>
              Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 36 cmt. d (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999), and Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 106 cmt. b (1959), provide, similar to subsection (c), that a resignation does not release the resigning trustee from potential liabilities for acts or omissions while in office. The act of resignation can give rise to liability if the trustee resigns for the purpose of facilitating a breach of trust by a cotrustee. See Ream v. Frey, 107 F.3d 147 (3rd Cir. 1997).
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the residual responsibilities of a resigning trustee until the trust property is delivered to a successor trustee, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-707" target="_self">35-15-707</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the case of a revocable trust of which the settlor has the capacity to revoke, because the rights of the qualified beneficiaries are subject to the settlor's control (see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>), resignation of the trustee is accomplished by giving notice to the settlor (instead of any qualified beneficiaries) and all cotrustees. In the case of a revocable trust of which the settlor does not currently have the capacity to revoke due to incapacity, resignation of the trustee is accomplished by giving notice to all cotrustees and to: the person or persons who are appointed as successor trustee(s) under the trust instrument; or if none, to any person holding a power under the trust instrument to appoint a successor trustee; or if none, to any agent under any durable power of attorney for such incapacitated settlor if such durable power of attorney grants the agent the power to accept same or to appoint successor trustees; or if note to the conservator or guardian of the property of the settlor. Should there be none of the above such persons, either the resigning trustee, a qualified beneficiary or a cotrustee can petition the court to approve such trustee’s resignation.

              Trial court found that the personal representative (PR) had become a creditor of the estate with all his claims for fees and reimbursement, and he was removed because he failed to complete the probate within the time frame the trial court provided, plus he mishandled the estate, and thus the trial court was within its rights to remove the PR based on his unfitness, unwillingness or failure to administer the estate effectively.

             <p>
              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (a), contrary to the common law, grants the settlor of an irrevocable trust the right to petition for removal of a trustee. The right to petition for removal does not give the settlor of an irrevocable trust any other rights, such as the right to an annual report or to receive other information concerning administration of the trust. The right of a qualified beneficiary to petition for removal does not apply to a revocable trust while the settlor has capacity. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>, while a trust is revocable and the settlor has capacity, the rights of the beneficiaries are subject to the settlor's exclusive control.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (a) differs from Uniform Trust Code section 706(a) in that under such subsection, only a qualified (and not any nonqualified) beneficiary who is displeased with the choice of the qualified beneficiaries may petition the court for removal of the trustee. Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706" target="_self">35-15-706</a></cite>, a settlor or cotrustee may also so petition for removal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trustee removal may be regulated by the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. In fashioning a removal provision for an irrevocable trust, the drafter should be cognizant of the danger that the trust may be included in the settlor's federal gross estate if the settlor retains the power to be appointed as trustee or to appoint someone who is not independent. See Rev. Rul. 95-58, 1995-2 C.B. 191.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (b) lists the grounds for removal of the trustee. The grounds for removal are similar to those found in Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). A trustee may be removed for unto-ward action, such as for a serious breach of trust, but the section is not so limited. A trustee may also be removed under a variety of circumstances in which the court concludes that the trustee is not best serving the interests of the beneficiaries. The term “interests of the beneficiaries” means the beneficial interests as provided in the terms of the trust, not as defined by the beneficiaries. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Removal for conduct detrimental to the interests of the beneficiaries is a well-established standard for removal of a trustee. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. d (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 107 cmt. a (1959).
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (b)(1), consistent with Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. e and g (Tentative Draft No, 2, approved 1999), makes clear that not every breach of trust justifies removal of the trustee. The breach must be “serious.” A serious breach of trust may consist of a single act that causes significant harm or involves flagrant misconduct. A serious breach of trust may also consist of a series of smaller breaches, none of which individually justify removal when considered alone, but which do so when considered together. A particularly appropriate circumstance justifying removal of the trustee is a serious breach of the trustee's duty to keep the beneficiaries reasonably informed of the administration of the trust or to comply with a beneficiary's request for information to the extent required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows “quiet” trusts. If a trustee is not keeping the beneficiaries reasonably informed of the administration of the trust or does not comply with a beneficiary's request for information because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813ol1e" target="_self">35-15-813(e)</a></cite> or (f) applies, or a beneficiary or other person has failed or refused to comply with the requirements of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813ol1g" target="_self">35-15-813(g)</a></cite>, then the trustee’s action in not keeping a beneficiary, person, beneficiaries or persons so informed does not constitute any breach of trust whatsoever.
             </p>
             <p>
              The lack of cooperation among trustees justifying removal under subdivision (b)(2) need not involve a breach of trust. The key factor is whether the administration of the trust is significantly impaired by the trustees' failure to agree. Removal is particularly appropriate if the naming of an even number of trustees, combined with their failure to agree, has resulted in deadlock requiring court resolution. The court may remove one or more or all of the trustees. If a cotrustee remains in office following the removal, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> appointment of a successor trustee is not re-quired.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (b)(2) deals only with lack of cooperation among cotrustees, not with friction between the trustee and beneficiaries. Friction between the trustee and beneficiaries is ordinarily not a basis for removal. However, removal might be justified if a communications breakdown is caused by the trustee or appears to be incurable. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999).
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (b)(3) authorizes removal for a variety of grounds, including unfitness, unwillingness, or persistent failure to administer the trust effectively. Removal in any of these cases is allowed only if it best serves the interests of the beneficiaries. The term “interests of the beneficiaries” means the beneficial interests as provided in the terms of the trust, not as defined by the beneficiaries. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. “Unfitness” may include not only mental incapacity but also lack of basic ability to administer the trust. Before removing a trustee for unfitness the court should consider:
             </p>
             <p>
              the extent to which the problem might be cured by a delegation of functions the trustee is personally incapable of performing; and
             </p>
             <p>
              if the trustee is serving under a directed trust, the nature of the powers and duties held by the trustee, as well as the extent to which such trustee is an excluded fiduciary relative to other powers and duties.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Unwillingness” includes not only cases where the trustee refuses to act but also a pattern of indifference to some or all of the beneficiaries. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). A “persistent failure to administer the trust effectively” might include a long-term pattern of mediocre performance, such as consistently poor investment results when compared to comparable trusts.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has traditionally been more difficult to remove a trustee named by the settlor than a trustee named by the court, particularly if the settlor at the time of the appointment was aware of the trustee's failings. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 37 cmt. f (Tentative Draft No.2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 107 cmt. f-g (1959). Be-cause of the discretion normally granted to a trustee, the settlor's confidence in the judgment of the particular person whom the settlor selected to act as trustee is entitled to considerable weight. This deference to the settlor's choice can weaken or dissolve if a substantial change in the trustee's circumstances occurs. To honor a settlor's reasonable expectations, subdivision (b)(4) lists a substantial change of circumstances as a possible basis for removal of the trustee. Changed circumstances justifying removal of a trustee might include a substantial change in the character of the service or location of the trustee. A corporate reorganization of an institutional trustee is not itself a change of circumstances if it does not affect the service provided the individual trust account. Before removing a trustee on account of changed circumstances, the court must also conclude that removal is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust, that it will best serve the interests of the beneficiaries, and that a suitable cotrustee or successor trustee is available.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subdivision (b)(4) also contains a specific but more limited application of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite>. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> allows the qualified beneficiaries, by unanimous agreement of such qualified beneficiaries, to compel modification of a trust if the court concludes that the particular modification is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706ol1b4" target="_self">35-15-706(b)(4)</a></cite> similarly allows the qualified beneficiaries to request removal of the trustee if the designation of the trustee was not a material purpose of the trust. Before removing the trustee the court must also find that removal will best serve the interests of the beneficiaries and that a suitable cotrustee or successor trustee is available.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (c) authorizes the court to intervene pending a final decision on a request to remove a trustee. Among the relief that the court may order under subsection T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001" target="_self">35-15-1001</a></cite> is an injunction prohibiting the trustee from performing certain acts and the appointment of a special fiduciary to perform some or all of the trustee's functions.

             </p>
             <p>
              This section addresses the continuing authority and duty of a resigning or removed trustee. Subject to the power of the court to make other arrangements or unless a cotrustee remains in office, a resigning or removed trustee has continuing authority until the trust property is delivered to a successor. If a cotrustee remains in office, there is no reason to grant a resigning or removed trustee any continuing authority, and none is granted under this section.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is ample authority in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code for the appointment of a special fiduciary, an appointment which can avoid the need for a resigning or removed trustee to exercise residual powers until a successor can take office. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704ol1e" target="_self">35-15-704(e)</a></cite> (court may appoint additional trustee or special fiduciary whenever court considers appointment necessary for administration of trust), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-705ol1b" target="_self">35-15-705(b)</a></cite> (in approving resignation, court may impose conditions necessary for protection of trust property), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-706ol1c" target="_self">35-15-706(c)</a></cite> (pending decision on petition for removal, court may order appropriate relief), and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001ol1b5" target="_self">35-15-1001(b)(5)</a></cite> (to remedy breach of trust, court may appoint special fiduciary as necessary to protect trust property or interests of beneficiary).
             </p>
             <p>
              If the former trustee has died, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not require that the trustee's personal representative windup the deceased trustee's administration. Nor is a trustee's conservator or guardian required to complete the former trustee's administration if the trustee's authority terminated due to an adjudication of incapacity. However, to limit the former trustee's liability, the personal representative, conservator or guardian may submit a trustee's report on the former trustee's behalf. Otherwise, the former trustee remains liable for actions taken during the trustee's term of office until liability is otherwise barred.

              T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-707ol1b" target="_self">35-15-707(b)</a></cite> recognizes that the process of changing trustees does not take place overnight. The resigning or removed trustee may have to sell proprietary mutual funds whose sale is limited to certain times each month; it may have to wait for a court order to become final; it may wish to have in hand releases from beneficiaries; and it may have to wait on the preparation and filing of deeds or other instruments of conveyance before transferring the trust property in its possession or under its control.

              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-708" target="_self">35-15-708</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) establishes a standard of reasonable compensation. Such standard applies to the extent that the terms of a trust, or a settlor if living, or otherwise a majority of the qualified beneficiaries as defined in T.C.A. 35-15-103 have not otherwise agreed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Relevant factors in determining the standard of reasonable compensation, as specified in the Restatement, include the custom of the community; the trustee's skill, experience, and facilities; the time devoted to trust duties; the amount and character of the trust property; the degree of difficulty, responsibility and risk assumed in administering the trust, including in making discretionary distributions; the nature and costs of services rendered by others; and the quality of the trustee's performance. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. c (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Re-statement (Second) of Trusts § 242 cmt. b (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               Because “trustee” as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> includes not only an individual trustee but also cotrustees, each trustee, including a cotrustee, is entitled to reasonable compensation under the circumstances. The fact that a trust has more than one trustee does not mean that the trustees together are entitled to more compensation than had either acted alone. Nor does the appointment of more than one (1) trustee mean that the trustees are eligible to receive the compensation in equal shares. The total amount of the compensation to be paid and how it will be divided depend on the totality of the circumstances. Factors to be considered include the settlor's reasons for naming more than one (1) trustee and the level of responsibility assumed and exact services performed by each trustee. Often the fees of cotrustees will be in the aggregate higher than the fees for a single trustee because of the duty of each trustee to participate in administration and not delegate to a cotrustee duties the settlor expected the trustees to perform jointly. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. i (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999). The trust may benefit in such cases from the enhanced quality of decision-making resulting from the collective deliberations of the trustees.
              </p>
              <p>
               The same standard of reasonable compensation that applies to trustees and to cotrustees applies to trust protectors, trust advisors and any other fiduciary.
              </p>
              <p>
               In setting compensation, the services actually performed and responsibilities assumed by the trustee should be closely examined. A downward adjustment of fees may be appropriate if a trustee has delegated significant duties to agents, such as the delegation of investment authority to outside managers. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807" target="_self">35-15-807</a></cite> (delegation by trustee). On the other hand, a trustee with special skills, such as those of a real estate agent, may be entitled to extra compensation for performing services that would ordinarily be delegated. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. d (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 242 cmt. d (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               Similarly, in setting compensation for any fiduciary serving under a directed trust, the powers held and duties owed, the services actually performed and responsibilities assumed by any fiduciary, as well as the extent to which such fiduciary is an excluded fiduciary should be closely examined and adjusted accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
               Financial institution trustees normally base their fees on published fee schedules. Published fee schedules are subject to the same standard of reasonableness under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code as are other methods for computing fees. The courts have generally upheld published fee schedules but this is not automatic. Among the more litigated topics is the issue of termination fees. Termination fees are charged upon termination of the trust and sometimes upon transfer of the trust to a successor trustee. Factors relevant to whether the fee is appropriate include the actual work performed; whether a termination fee was authorized in the terms of the trust; whether the fee schedule specified the circumstances in which a termination fee would be charged; whether the trustee's overall fees for administering the trust from the date of the trust's creation, including the termination fee, were reasonable; and the general practice in the community regarding termination fees. Because significantly less work is normally involved, termination fees are less appropriate upon transfer to a successor trustee than upon termination of the trust. For representative cases, see Cleveland Trust Co. v. Wilmington Trust Co., 258 A.2d 58 (Del. 1969); In re Trusts Under Will of Dwan, 371 N.W. 2d 641 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985); Mercer v. Merchants National Bank, 298 A.2d 736 (N.H. 1972); In re Estate of Payson, 562 N.Y.S. 2d 329 (Surr. Ct. 1990); In re Indenture Agreement of Lawson, 607 A. 2d 803 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992); In re Estate of Ischy, 415 A.2d 37 (Pa. 1980); Memphis Memorial Park v. Planters National Bank, 1986 Tenn.

              </p>
              <p>
               This Code does not take a specific position on whether dual fees may be charged when a trustee hires its own law firm to represent the trust. The trend is to authorize dual compensation as long as the overall fees are reasonable. For a discussion, see Ronald C. Link, Developments Regarding the Professional Responsibility of the Estate Administration Lawyer: The Effect of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, 26 Real Prop. Prob. & Tr. J. 1, 22-38 (1991).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) permits the terms of the trust to override the reasonable compensation standard, subject to the court's inherent equity power to make adjustments downward or upward in appropriate circumstances. Compensation provisions should be drafted with care. Common questions include whether a provision in the terms of the trust setting the amount of the trustee's compensation is binding on a successor trustee, whether a dispositive provision for the trustee in the terms of the trust is in addition to or in lieu of the trustee's regular compensation, and whether a dispositive provision for the trustee is conditional on the person performing services as trustee. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. e (Tentative Draft No.2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 242 cmt. f (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               The preceding paragraph also applies to any fiduciary serving under a directed trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               Compensation may be set by agreement. A trustee may enter into an agreement with the settlor or a majority of the qualified beneficiaries for lesser or increased compensation, although an agreement increasing compensation is not binding on a nonconsenting beneficiary. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111" target="_self">35-15-111</a></cite> (matters that may be the resolved by nonjudicial settlement). See also Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. f (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 242 cmt. i (1959). A trustee may also agree to waive compensation and should do so prior to rendering significant services if concerned about possible gift and income taxation of the compensation accrued prior to the waiver. See Rev. Rul. 66-167, 1966-1 C.B. 20. See also Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. g (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 242 cmt. j (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               The preceding paragraph also applies to any fiduciary serving under a directed trust.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

Allowing the trustee to pay its compensation without prior court approval promotes efficient trust administration but does place a significant burden on a beneficiary who believes the compensation is unreasonable. Unlike with the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not require a trustee to provide the qualified beneficiaries with advance notice of any change in the method or rate of the trustee's compensation.

Chargeable to principal are fees calculated on principal for acceptance, distribution, or termination of the trust, and fees charged on disbursements made to prepare property for sale. However, several other sections of such act may modify this. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-104" target="_self">35-6-104</a></cite> provides a trustee the power to adjust between income and principal in certain cases.

              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-709" target="_self">35-15-709</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               A trustee has the authority to expend trust funds as necessary in the administration of the trust, including expenses incurred in the hiring of agents. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807" target="_self">35-15-807</a></cite> (delegation by trustee) and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite> (trustee to pay expenses of administration from trust).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a)(1) clarifies that a trustee is entitled to reimbursement from the trust for incurring expenses within the trustee's authority. The trustee may also withhold appropriate reimbursement for expenses before making distributions to the beneficiaries. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 38 cmt. b (Tentative Draft No. 2, approved 1999); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 244 cmt. b (1959). A trustee is ordinarily not entitled to reimbursement for incurring unauthorized expenses. Such expenses are normally the personal responsibility of the trustee.
              </p>
              <p>
               As provided in subdivision (a)(2), a trustee is entitled to reimbursement for unauthorized expenses only if the unauthorized expenditures benefitted the trust The purpose of this provision, which is derived from Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 245 (1959), is not to ratify the unauthorized conduct of the trustee, but to prevent unjust enrichment of the trust. Given this purpose, a court, on appropriate grounds, may delay or even deny reimbursement for expenses which benefitted the trust. Appropriate grounds include: (1) whether the trustee acted in bad faith in incurring the expense; (2) whether the trustee knew that the expense was inappropriate; (3) whether the trustee reasonably believed the expense was necessary for the preservation of the trust estate; (4) whether the expense has resulted in a benefit; and (5) whether indemnity can be allowed without defeating or impairing the purposes of the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 245 cmt. g (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) implements T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802ol1k5" target="_self">35-15-802(k)(5)</a></cite>, which creates an exception to the duty of loyalty for advances by the trustee for the protection of the trust if the transaction is fair to the beneficiaries.
              </p>
              <p>
               Reimbursement under this section may include attorney's fees and expenses incurred by the trustee in defending an action. However, a trustee is not ordinarily entitled to attorney's fees and expenses if it is determined that the trustee breached the trust. See 3A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 245 (4th ed. 1988).
              </p>
              <p>
               All of the above provisions also apply to trust advisors, trust protectors and other fiduciaries serving under a directed trust.

              General Comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The provisions of part 8 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent such part is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
             </p>
             <p>
              Part 8 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code states the fundamental duties of a trustee and lists the trustee's powers. Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808" target="_self">35-15-808</a></cite> and part 12 such powers may be removed from a trustee and directed to others, in which case the fiduciary from whom such powers were removed shall be an excluded fiduciary as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Part 8 also provides for how certain of such powers may be exercised and the judicial standards by which certain of those powers may be reviewed. The duties listed are not new, but how the particular duties are formulated and applied has changed over the years. Moreover, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows far greater latitude than does the Uniform Trust Code in the exercise of discretion relative to certain of such duties, as well as who can and does hold such duties. This part was drafted where possible to conform with the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act. The Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act prescribes a trustee's responsibilities with respect to the management and investment of trust property. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code also addresses a trustee's duties with respect to distribution to beneficiaries and is far more flexible than is the Uniform Trust Code relative to such.

             <p>
              The Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002, codified at title 35, part 14, has been incorporated by reference into the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-901" target="_self">35-15-901</a></cite>. Certain sections of this part 8 overlap with the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act. Those sections are T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802" target="_self">35-15-802</a></cite> (duty of loyalty), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-803ol1impartiality" target="_self">35-15-803 (impartiality)</a></cite>, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-805" target="_self">35-15-805</a></cite> (costs of administration), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-806" target="_self">35-15-806</a></cite> (trustee's skills) and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807ol1delegation" target="_self">35-15-807 (delegation)</a></cite>.

              Unlike with the Uniform Trust Code, all of the provisions of this part of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code may be overridden in the terms of the trust except for the trustee's fundamental obligation to act in accordance with the purposes of the trust, and for the benefit of the beneficiaries as the interests of such beneficiaries are defined under the terms of the trust. (See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>).

              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite>.

             <p>
              In furtherance of the policy of the state of Tennessee and its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent and freedom of disposition, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code governs a trustee’s (or other fiduciary’s) duties only to the extent such terms of a trust are silent or for some reason invalid on a particular issue. This section provides for the following default rules, which are only applicable to the extent of such silence or to the extent of such invalidity.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section confirms that a primary duty of a trustee is to follow the terms and purposes of the trust and to do so in good faith. However, unlike with the Uniform Trust Code, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows the terms of a trust to remove from a trustee or other fiduciary the duty to act in good faith, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              In administering the trust, the trustee must not only comply with this section but also with the other duties specified in this part, particularly the obligation not to place the interests of others above those of the beneficiaries as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802" target="_self">35-15-802</a></cite> (but such section allows far more latitude than does section 802 of the Uniform Trust Code to deal with affiliates or in affiliated investments), the duty to act with prudence as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-804" target="_self">35-15-804</a></cite>, and the duty to keep certain beneficiaries and holders of powers of appointment reasonably informed about the administration of the trust as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite> (but under such section a fiduciary owes such duty to far fewer beneficiaries than under section 813 of the Uniform Trust Code, and unlike the latter, allows such duty to be re-moved either in the trust instrument or by any of a settlor, trust advisor or trust protector in a writing delivered to the trustee).
             </p>
             <p>
              While a trustee generally must administer a trust in accordance with its terms and purposes, the purposes and particular terms of the trust can on occasion conflict. If such a conflict occurs because of circumstances not anticipated by the settlor, it may be appropriate for the trustee to petition under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> to modify or terminate the trust. Pursuant to section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite>, a trustee is not required to perform a duty prescribed by the terms of the trust if performance would be impossible or illegal. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-404" target="_self">35-15-404</a></cite> contains no mention of public policy.
             </p>
             <p>
              For background on the trustee's duty to administer the trust, see Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 164-169 (1959).
             </p>
             <p>
              Certain of the above-cited sections of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent any of such cited sections are in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section also confirms that a trustee does not have a duty to act until the trustee has accepted the trusteeship. Such duty continues until the trust either terminates or a successor trustee is appointed and all assets of the trust are delivered to such successor trustee. For the procedure for accepting a trusteeship, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite>. For the procedures relative to appointment of a successor trustee and delivery of property by a former trustee, see T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-707" target="_self">35-15-707</a></cite>, respectively. For procedures relative to trust advisors, trust protectors and other fiduciaries accepting such offices and providing for successors to such offices, see T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-711" target="_self">35-15-711</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-713" target="_self">35-15-713</a></cite>, respectively.

               Trustee's decision relating to a farm lease did not violate three statutory duties within the Uniform Trust Code because it exercised reasonable care, skill, and caution in its decision regarding the farm lease, and it kept a son reasonably informed about the administration of the trust and the farm lease. The son failed to demonstrate that the trustee administered the trust in a manner that was adverse to his beneficial interest as that interest was defined under the terms of the trust. Glass v.

               The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements.

               This section addresses the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most fundamental duty of the trustee. Subsection (a) states the general principle, which is copied from Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170(1) (1959). A trustee owes a duty of loyalty to the beneficiaries, a principle which is sometimes expressed as the obligation of the trustee not to place the trustee's own interests over those of the beneficiaries. Most but not all violations of the duty of loyalty concern transactions involving the trust property, but breaches of the duty can take other forms. For a discussion of the different types of violations, see George G. Bogert &amp; George T. Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees § 543 (Rev. 2d ed. 1993); and 2A Austin W. Scott &amp; William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts §§ 170-170.24 (4th ed. 1987). The “interests of the beneficiaries” to which the trustee must be loyal are the beneficial interests as provided in the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               The duty of loyalty applies to both charitable and noncharitable trusts, even though the beneficiaries of charitable trusts are indefinite. In the case of a charitable trust, the trustee must administer the trust solely in the interests of effectuating the trust's charitable purposes, as the purposes are defined under the terms of the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 379 cmt. a (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               Duty of loyalty issues often arise in connection with the settlor's designation of the trustee. For example, it is not uncommon that the trustee will also be a beneficiary. Or the settlor will name a friend or family member who is an officer of a company in which the settlor owns stock. In such cases, settlors should be advised to consider addressing in the terms of the trust how such conflicts are to be handled. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite> authorizes a settlor to override an other-wise applicable duty of loyalty in the terms of the trust. Sometimes the override is implied. The grant to a trustee of authority to make a discretionary distribution to a class of beneficiaries that includes the trustee implicitly authorizes the trustee to make distributions for the trustee's own benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) states the general rule with respect to transactions involving trust property that are affected by a conflict of interest. A transaction affected by a conflict between the trustee's fiduciary and personal interests is voidable by a beneficiary who is affected by the transaction. Subsection (b) carries out the “no further inquiry” rule by making transactions involving trust property entered into by a trustee for the trustee's own personal account voidable without further proof. Such transactions are irrebuttably presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests. It is immaterial whether the trustee acts in good faith or pays a fair consideration. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170 cmt. b (1959). Note that subsection (b) varies from section 802(b) of the Uniform Trust Code in that such subsection is subject not only to the rights of persons dealing with or assisting the trustee as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite>, but is also subject to any other right allowed under Tennessee law.
              </p>
              <p>
               The rule is less severe with respect to transactions involving trust property entered into with persons who have close business or personal ties with the trustee. Under subsection (c), a transaction between a trustee and certain relatives and business associates is presumptively voidable, not void. Also presumptively voidable are transactions with corporations or other enterprises in which the trustee, or a person who owns a significant interest in the trustee, has an interest that might affect the trustee's best judgment. The presumption is rebutted if the trustee establishes that the transaction was not affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests. Among the factors tending to rebut the presumption are whether the consideration was fair and whether the other terms of the transaction are similar to those that would be transacted with an independent party
              </p>
              <p>
               Even where the presumption under subsection (c) does not apply, a transaction may still be voided by a beneficiary if the beneficiary proves that a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests existed and that the transaction was affected by the conflict. The right of a beneficiary to void a transaction affected by a conflict of interest is optional. If the transaction proves profitable to the trust and unprofitable to the trustee, the beneficiary will likely allow the transaction to stand. For a comparable provision regulating fiduciary investments by national banks, see 12 C.F.R. § 9.12(a).
              </p>
              <p>
               As provided in subsection (b), no breach of the duty of loyalty occurs if the transaction was authorized by the terms of the trust or approved by the court, or if the beneficiary failed to commence a judicial proceeding against the appropriate fiduciary within the time allowed or chose to ratify the transaction, either prior to or subsequent to its occurrence. In determining whether a beneficiary has consented to a transaction, the principles of representation from title 35, chapter 3 may be applied.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(5), which is derived from section 3-713(1) of the Uniform Probate Code, allows a trustee to implement a contract or pursue a claim that the trustee entered into or acquired before the person became or contemplated becoming trustee. While this subsection allows the transaction to proceed without automatically being voidable by a beneficiary, the transaction is not necessarily free from scrutiny. In implementing the contract or pursuing the claim, the trustee must still complete the transaction in a way that avoids a conflict between the trustee's fiduciary and personal interests. Because avoiding such a conflict will frequently be difficult, the trustee should consider petitioning the court to appoint a special fiduciary, as authorized by subsection (l) of this section, to work out the details and complete the transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (d) does not apply to a corporate trustee that makes a loan to or sells a financial product to a beneficiary in the ordinary course of business. Otherwise, subsection (d) creates a presumption that a transaction between a trustee and a beneficiary not involving trust property is an abuse by the trustee of a confidential relationship with the beneficiary. This subsection has limited scope. If the trust has terminated, there must be proof that the trustee's influence with the beneficiary remained. Furthermore, whether or not the trust has terminated, there must be proof that the trustee obtained an advantage from the relationship. The fact the trustee profited is insufficient to show an abuse if a third party would have similarly profited in an arm's length transaction. See 2A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher § 170.25 (4th ed. 1987), which states the same principle in a slightly different form: “Where he deals directly with the beneficiaries, the transaction may stand, but only if the trustee makes full disclosure and takes no advantage of his position and the transaction is in all respects fair and reasonable.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (e), which allows a beneficiary to void a transaction entered into by the trustee that involved an opportunity belonging to the trust, is based on Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170 cmt. k (1959). While normally associated with corporations and with their directors and officers, what is usually referred to as the corporate opportunity doctrine also applies to other types of fiduciary. The doctrine prohibits the trustee's pursuit of certain business activities, such as entering into a business in direct competition with a business owned by the trust, or the purchasing of an investment that the facts suggest the trustee was expected to purchase for the trust. For discussion of the corporate opportunity doctrine, see Kenneth B. Davis, Jr., Corporate Opportunity and Comparative Advantage, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 211 (1999); and Richard A. Epstein, Contract and Trust in Corporate Law: The Case of Corporate Opportunity, 21 Del. J. Corp. L. 5 (1996). See also Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations § 5.05 (American Law Inst. 1994).

               Subsections (f) through (i) diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. Subsections (f) through (i) clearly grant the express authority to use affiliates and related parties or affiliated delegatees to manage assets and perform administrative functions. This increases flexibility and grants fiduciaries the ability to leverage expertise inside their broad organization. Versus the common law, the restatements, the Uniform Trust Code and Uniform Prudent Investor Act (as such uniform acts are proposed by ULC – NCCUSL), these provisions grant exceptions to the no further inquiry rule relative to conflicts of interests for investments and other transactions between affiliates so long as these transactions are fairly priced, are in accordance with the interests of the beneficiaries and the interests of the fiduciary appointment and otherwise comply with the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act. Under most circumstances, a fiduciary must disclose, at least annually (unless there has been no change) to the beneficiaries entitled to receive a copy of the trustee's annual report, the rate and method by which any additional compensation paid, earned or received from or by any affiliate was determined.
              </p>
              <p>
               In furtherance of its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent and of freedom of disposition, under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, subsection (j) can be completely overridden by the terms of the trust. Moreover, under such code, the power to vote shares of stock or in exercising control over similar interests in other forms of enterprise may be removed from any trustee and placed in the hands of any other fiduciary as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. When such occurs any fiduciary from which such powers were so removed is an excluded fiduciary as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>
              </p>
              <p>
               Absent the terms of a trust overriding subsection (j) as discussed in the immediately preceding paragraph, such sub-section addresses an overlap between trust and corporate law. It is based on Restatement of Trusts (Second) § 193 cmt. a (1959), which provides that “[i]t is the duty of the trustee in voting shares of stock to use proper care to promote the interest of the beneficiary,” and that the fiduciary responsibility of a trustee in voting a control block “is heavier than where he holds only a small fraction of the shares.” Similarly, the department of labor construes ERISA's duty of loyalty to make share voting a fiduciary function. See 29 C.F.R. § 2509.94-2. When the trust owns the entirety of the shares of a corporation, the corporate assets are in effect trust assets that the trustee determines to hold in corporate form. The trustee may not use the corporate form to escape the fiduciary duties of trust law. Thus, for example, a trustee whose duty of impartiality would require the trustee to make current distributions for the support of current beneficiaries may not evade that duty by holding assets in corporate form and pleading the discretion of corporate directors to determine dividend policy. Rather, the trustee must vote for corporate directors who will follow a dividend policy consistent with the trustee's trust-law duty of impartiality.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (k) contains several exceptions to the general duty of loyalty, which apply if the transaction was fair to the beneficiaries. Subdivisions (k)(1) and (k)(2) clarify that a trustee is free to contract about the terms of appointment and rate of compensation. Consistent with Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170 cmt. r (1959), subdivision (k)(3) authorizes a trustee to engage in a transaction involving another trust of which the trustee is also trustee, a transaction with a decedent's estate or a conservatorship estate of which the trustee is personal representative or conservator, or a transaction with another trust or other fiduciary relationship in which a beneficiary of the trust has an interest. The authority of a trustee to deposit funds in a financial institution operated by the trustee, as provided in subdivision (k)(4), is recognized in Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 170 cmt. m (1959). The power to deposit funds in its own institution does not negate the trustee's responsibility to invest prudently, including the obligation to earn a reasonable rate of interest on deposits. Subdivision (k)(5) authorizes a trustee to advance money for the protection of the trust. Such advances usually are of small amounts and are made in emergencies or as a matter of convenience. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-709" target="_self">35-15-709</a></cite>, the trustee has a lien against the trust property for any advances made.

             <p>
              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-803" target="_self">35-15-803</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              The duty of impartiality is an important aspect of the duty of loyalty. This section is very similar to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-108" target="_self">35-14-108</a></cite>, except that this section also applies to all aspects of trust administration and to decisions by a trustee with respect to distributions. The Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act Investor Act, in title 35, chapter 14, is limited to duties with respect to the investment and management of trust property. The differing beneficial interests for which the trustee must act impartially include those of the current beneficiaries versus those of beneficiaries holding interests in the remainder; and among those currently eligible to receive distributions. In fulfilling the duty to act impartially, the trustee should be particularly sensitive to allocation of receipts and disbursements between income and principal and should consider, in an appropriate case, a reallocation of income to the principal account and vice versa, as is allowable under the Tennessee Uniform Principal and Income Act in title 35, chapter 6.
             </p>
             <p>
              The duty to act impartially does not mean that the trustee must treat the beneficiaries equally. Rather, the trustee must treat the beneficiaries equitably in light of the purposes and terms of the trust as such purposes and terms are stated therein. A settlor who prefers that the trustee, when making decisions, generally favor the interests of one beneficiary over those of others should provide appropriate guidance in the terms of the trust and is completely free to do so under the Tennessee trust statutes. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 183 cmt. a (1959).

              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-804" target="_self">35-15-804</a></cite>.

              The duty to administer a trust with prudence is a fundamental duty of the trustee. This duty does not depend on whether the trustee receives compensation. The duty may be freely altered by the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. This section is similar to language contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-104" target="_self">35-14-104</a></cite> and Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227 (1992).
             </p>
             <p>
              The language of this section diverges from the language of the previous Restatement. The prior Restatement can be read as applying the same standard -- “man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property”-- regardless of the type or purposes of the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174 cmt. a (1959). This section appropriately bases the standard on the purposes and other circumstances of the particular trust.
             </p>
             <p>
              Notwithstanding the references to restatements in the preceding two paragraph. to the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or con-trolling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moreover, the duties imposed by this section may be freely altered or removed by the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. Nevertheless, any such alteration is subject to the prohibition in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite> regarding exculpation of trustees.

              This section is similar to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-109" target="_self">35-14-109</a></cite> and is consistent with the rules concerning costs in Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 227(c)(3)(1992). For related rules concerning compensation and reimbursement of trustees, trust advisors or trust protectors, see T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-708" target="_self">35-15-708</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-709" target="_self">35-15-709</a></cite>. The duty not to incur unreasonable costs applies when a trustee decides whether and how to delegate to agents, as well as to other aspects of trust administration. In deciding whether and how to delegate, the trustee must be alert to balancing projected benefits against the likely costs. To protect the beneficiary against excessive costs, the trustee should also be alert to adjusting compensation for functions which the trustee has delegated to others. The obligation to incur only necessary or appropriate costs of administration has long been part of the law of trusts. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 188 (1959). Notwithstanding the above, subject to the restrictions contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>, the provisions of this section may be freely altered by the terms of the trust.

             </p>
             <p>
              This section permits trustees to delegate various aspects of trust administration to agents, subject to the standards of the section. The language is derived from T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-111" target="_self">35-14-111</a></cite>. See also John H. Langbein, Reversing the Nondelegation Rule of Trust-Investment Law, 59 Mo. L. Rev. 105 (1994) (discussing prior law).
             </p>
             <p>
              This section encourages and protects the trustee in making delegations appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the particular trust. Whether a particular function is delegable is based on whether it is a function that a prudent trustee might delegate under similar circumstances. For example, delegating some administrative and reporting duties might be prudent for a family trustee but unnecessary for a corporate trustee.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moreover, subsection (c) clearly applies the provisions of this section to fiduciaries, as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, from whom the duties relative to any item so delegated were removed and were placed in the hands of, or the power to so delegate was given to, another fiduciary, the fiduciary from whom such duties were removed being an excluded fiduciary as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section applies only to delegation to agents, not to delegation to a cotrustee. For the provision regulating delegation to a cotrustee, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-703" target="_self">35-15-703</a></cite>.

               The provisions of this section diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the ex-tent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               The 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code substantially rewrote this section, leaving the former version inoperative as provided in the enacting and transitional language of Section 55, Pub. Act. 2013, Pub. Ch. 390, 108th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Tenn., 2013). Notwithstanding the above, Tennessee has had statutes fully providing for true directed trusts since the late 1980s, such provisions being contained in title 35, chapter 3. Part twelve (12) of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, added by such 2013 amendments, contains significantly more detailed provisions governing the operation of directed trusts than do Tennessee’s original 1980s directed trust statutes. Finally, many modifications to various other provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and certain other provisions of the Tennessee trust statutes have been made to coordinate those provisions with such part twelve (12). For all these reasons, in addition to the transitional language of Section 55 of such public chapter, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808ol1f" target="_self">35-15-808(f)</a></cite> contains transitional provisions specifically applicable to directed trusts as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) is an application of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite>, which provides that a revocable trust is subject to the settlor's exclusive control as long as the settlor has capacity. Because of the settlor's degree of control, subsection (a) of this section authorizes a trustee to rely on a direction from the settlor even if it is contrary to the terms of the trust. The direction of the settlor might be regarded as an amendment of the trust. Subsection (a) has limited application upon a settlor's incapacity. An agent, conservator, or guardian has authority to give the trustee instructions contrary to the terms of the trust only if the agent, conservator, or guardian succeeds to the settlor's powers with respect to revocation, amendment, or distribution as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602" target="_self">35-15-602</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsections (b) -- (e) ratify the use of trust protectors and advisers and make such, except as otherwise provided in the transitional provisions of subsection (f), subject to part twelve (12) of this chapter. Neither T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> nor such chapter makes a distinction between the powers and duties that can be held by a fiduciary due to such being referred to as “trust advisor” versus “trust protector.” Traditionally, the former term has been used in the United States, while the latter term is often associated with non-U.S. trust practice. Both terms were included to assure anyone encountering the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code that, regardless of the term by which any such person was referred, such code provided for virtually any conceivable power and duty that could be held by a person referred to by either term. Both trust advisors and trust protectors are also included in the broader term, “fiduciary,” both being such unless provided otherwise in the terms of the trust as allowed by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>, or because one or more is an excluded fiduciary as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c01s35-1-103" target="_self">35-1-103</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) diverges from the Uniform Trust Code in that the various powers that can be held by either a trust advisor or a trust protector can be conferred in any of the following ways: by the terms of the trust, by an agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or by a court order. Moreover, subject only to a provision in a trust instrument to the contrary, a trustee or other fiduciary shall act in accordance with the exercise of a power held by any trust advisor or trust protector.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (c) makes it clear that, regardless of what the power holder is named, such holder can be granted the power to direct modification or termination of a trust
              </p>
              <p>
               Numerous powers can be granted to a trust advisor or trust protector under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, including powers to direct and powers to veto. While both affect a trustee’s overall powers and duties, each affects such trustee in a different manner. A power to direct involves action initiated and within the control of a third party. A trustee usually has no responsibility other than to carry out the direction when made. But if a third party holds a veto power, a trustee is usually responsible for initiating the decision, subject to the third party's approval.

               Subsection (d) pertains to powers held in reliance on T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-122" target="_self">35-3-122</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-123" target="_self">35-3-123</a></cite>. These were the statutes fully providing for true directed trusts before the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Under such sections, at times, the person holding the power is making directions relative to the holder's own beneficial interest. However at other times, the holder of the power is frequently making directions or other actions on behalf of others. In such latter case and as provided in subsection (d), unless provided otherwise in the terms of the trust, the holder is acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the powers granted and can be held liable if the holder's conduct constitutes a breach of trust, whether through action or inaction. Like a trustee, liability cannot be imposed if the holder has not accepted the grant of the power either expressly or informally through exercise of the power. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-711" target="_self">35-15-711</a></cite>, which applies the provisions of T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite> to trust advisors, trust protectors and other fiduciaries other than a trustee.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (e) pertains to powers held under part 12, which was created by the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. It simply directs one to such part 12 to determine the effect of holding such powers. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and although such part 12 contains the majority of provisions governing trust advisors, trust protectors and any other fiduciaries other than trustees after the 2013 amendments, such amendments necessitated changes to other parts of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to coordinate them with the part 12. Therefore, one is advised to review other parts of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code for sections containing references to part 12 or to trust advisors, trust protectors, other fiduciaries and excluded fiduciaries. In particular, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-710" target="_self">35-15-710</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-715" target="_self">35-15-715</a></cite> provide for persons holding powers under directed trusts the mechanisms to accept, reject, remove or resign from office that are similar to equivalent provisions applicable to a trustee. Such sections also provide for how to handle vacancies in such offices, as well as any fiduciary’s bond regarding same.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (f) contains transitional provisions specifically applicable to directed trusts as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> to account for the changes in such trusts made by the 2013 amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               As with the vast majority of other sections under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the provisions of this section may be freely altered by the terms of the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. By way of example and not in limitation, a settlor can provide that the trustee must accept the decision of the power holder without question. Alternatively, a settlor could provide that the holder of the power is not to be held to the standards of a fiduciary. A common technique for assuring that a settlor continues to be taxed on all of the income of an irrevocable trust is for the settlor to retain a nonfiduciary power of administration. See I.R.C. § 675.

              This section codifies the substance of sections 175 and 176 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts (1959). The duty to take control of and safeguard trust property is an aspect of the trustee's duty of prudent administration as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-804" target="_self">35-15-804</a></cite>. See also the various subdivisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite> regarding the power to collect trust property), the power to insure trust property and the power to abandon trust property. The duty to take control normally means that the trustee must take physical possession of tangible personal property and securities belonging to the trust, and must secure payment of any choses in action. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 175 cmt. a, c &amp; d (1959).

             </p>
             <p>
              The duty to keep adequate records stated in subsection (a) is implicit in the duty to provide prudent administration under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-804" target="_self">35-15-804</a></cite> and the duty to report to beneficiaries under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>, subject to the exceptions to such duty to report as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>. For an application, see Green v. Lombard, 343 A. 2d 905, 911 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1975). See also Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 172, 174 (1959).
             </p>
             <p>
              The duty to earmark trust assets and the duty of a trustee not to mingle the assets of the trust with the trustee's own are closely related. Subsection (b), which addresses the duty not to mingle, is derived from section 179 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts (1959). Subsection (c) makes the requirement that assets be earmarked more precise than that articulated in Restatement (Second) § 179 by requiring that the interest of the trust must appear in the records of a third party, such as a bank, brokerage firm, or transfer agent. Because of the serious risk of mistake or misappropriation even if disclosure is made to the beneficiaries, showing the interest of the trust solely in the trustee's own internal records is insufficient. The provision of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816ol1b" target="_self">35-15-816(b)</a></cite>, which allows a trustee to hold securities in nominee form, is not inconsistent with this requirement. While securities held in nominee form are not specifically registered in the name of the trustee, they are properly earmarked because the trustee's holdings are indicated in the records maintained by an independent party, such as in an account at a brokerage firm.
             </p>
             <p>
              Earmarking is not practical for all types of assets. With respect to assets not subject to registration, such as tangible personal property and bearer securities, arranging for the trust's ownership interest to be reflected on the records of a third-party custodian would not be feasible. For this reason, subsection (c) waives separate recordkeeping for these types of assets. Under subsection (b), however, the duty of the trustee not to mingle these or any other trust assets with the trustee's own remains absolute.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (d) allows a trustee to use the property of two or more trusts to make joint investments, even though under traditional principles a joint investment would violate the duty to earmark. A joint investment frequently is more economical than attempting to invest the funds of each trust separately. Also, the risk of misappropriation or mistake is less when the trust property is invested jointly with the property of another trust than when pooled with the property of the trustee or other person.
             </p>
             <p>
              Notwithstanding all of the above, the provisions of this sections are freely alterable by the terms of the trust, subject to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.

It may not be reasonable to enforce a claim depending upon the likelihood of recovery and the cost of suit and enforcement. It might also be reasonable to settle an action or suffer a default rather than to defend an action.

The duty imposed by this section is not absolute.

Unlike Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 223 (1959), this section only requires a successor trustee to redress breaches of trust “known” to have been committed by the predecessor. For the definition of “know,” see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-104" target="_self">35-15-104</a></cite>. Limiting the successor's obligation to known breaches is a common feature of state trust statutes. See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. § 456.187.2.

             <p>
              The last sentence in this section has no counterpart in the Uniform Trust Code and expressly relieves any successor trustee from liability for acts and omissions of prior trustees if such successor trustee was appointed after the accounts of the prior trustee were examined or such examination was waived by the beneficiaries required under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to so waive.
             </p>

              As authorized by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>, the beneficiaries may relieve the trustee from potential liability for failing to pursue a claim against a predecessor trustee or other person holding trust property. The obligation to pursue a predecessor trustee can also be addressed in and altered by the terms of the trust as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.

               Trustee's decision relating to a farm lease did not violate three statutory duties within the Uniform Trust Code because it exercised reasonable care, skill, and caution in its decision regarding the farm lease, and it kept a son reasonably informed about the administration of the trust and the farm lease. The son failed to demonstrate that the trustee administered the trust in a manner that was adverse to his beneficial interest as that interest was defined under the terms of the trust. Glass v.

               Section Comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restate-ments. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               The duty to keep appropriate beneficiaries reasonably informed of the administration of the trust is a fundamental duty of a trustee. The term “reasonable” is used several times in this section. This term connotes a sensible and not excessive amount of information. For the common law duty to keep the beneficiaries informed, see Restatement (Second) of Trusts Section 173 (1959). The provisions of this section may diverge from such restatement’s view of the common law, and to the extent such restatement is in conflict with this section, such restatement’s view is rejected.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the interest of certainty, subdivision (a)(1) diverges from the Uniform Trust Code and makes the duty to keep the beneficiaries informed more precise by limiting it to only those who are current mandatory or permissible distributees of trust income or principal, or both
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (a)(2) provides that a trustee also has a duty to respond to a beneficiary’s request for information, unless such is unreasonable under the circumstances. However, again in the interest of certainty, subdivision (a)(2) diverges from the Uniform Trust Code and makes such duty to respond to a beneficiary’s request for information more precise by limiting such duty to only qualified beneficiaries s such are defined in T.C.A. 35-15-103. The result of this limitation is that the information need not be furnished to beneficiaries with remote remainder interests.
              </p>
              <p>
               No limitation in subdivisions (a)(1) nor (a)(2) affects the rights of the any current beneficiary who is designated as one or more primary beneficiaries, explicitly or implicitly, by the trust instrument.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nevertheless, unlike the Uniform Trust Code, subdivision (a)(2) requires that a qualified beneficiary reimburse the trustee for any reasonable expenses incurred in responding to requests for information.
              </p>
              <p>
               In determining if a beneficiary's request for trust information is reasonable, the trustee may consider any of the fol-lowing factors in determining whether a response is necessary and the extent of the information to be furnished:
              </p>
              <p>
               provisions of the trust document or other settlor written instructions concerning the providing of information;
              </p>
              <p>
               the relationship between the beneficiary requesting information and the other beneficiaries;
              </p>
              <p>
               the nature of the information requested;
              </p>
              <p>
               the frequency with which the beneficiary has or is requesting information;
              </p>
              <p>
               whether providing any of the requested information would violate any privacy rights of other beneficiaries;
              </p>
              <p>
               whether the requesting beneficiary is receiving statements on the trust account;
              </p>
              <p>
               the likelihood that the requesting beneficiary will eventually receive an interest in the trust;
              </p>
              <p>
               the cost of providing the requested information and whether the requesting beneficiary is willing to pay the cost. The trustee may require a prepayment of a fixed cost as a prerequisite to beginning to accumulate the information
              </p>
              <p>
               the availability of the information requested; and

               The trustee is under a duty to communicate to a qualified beneficiary information about the administration of the trust that is reasonably necessary to enable the beneficiary to enforce the beneficiary's rights and to prevent or redress a breach of trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 173 cmt. c (1959). Ordinarily, the trustee is not under a duty to furnish information to a beneficiary in the absence of a specific request for the information. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 173 cmt. d (1959). However, special circumstances may require that the trustee provide additional information. For example, if the trustee is dealing with the beneficiary on the trustee's own account, the trustee must communicate material facts relating to the transaction that the trustee knows or should know. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 173 cmt. d (1959). Furthermore, to enable the beneficiaries to take action to protect their interests, the trustee may be required to provide advance notice of transactions involving real estate, closely-held business interests, and other assets that are difficult to value or to replace. See In re Green Charitable Trust, 431 N.W. 2d 492 (Mich. Ct. App. 1988); Al-lard v. Pacific National Bank, 663 P.2d 104 (Wash. 1983). The trustee is justified in not providing such advance disclosure if disclosure is forbidden by other law, as under federal securities laws, or if disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the interests of the beneficiaries, for example, when disclosure would cause the loss of the only serious buyer. Notwithstanding the preceding portions of this paragraph to the extent any of it is in conflict with the Tennessee trust statutes, the latter are controlling.

               Subdivision (a)(3) causes the requirements of subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) to also apply to the benefit of anyone who, in a capacity other than that of a fiduciary holds a power of appointment; with all relevant terms having the meanings as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Holders of powers of appointment are not beneficiaries (and therefore, cannot be qualified beneficiaries) as such terms are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Nevertheless, in order to determine whether such power holder should not exercise or should exercise such power, as well as the manner in which any such exercise should be made, such power holder needs to be kept reasonably informed of the administration of a trust. Because other sections of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code assure that all fiduciaries are kept appropriately informed of the administration of a trust, there is no need to impose the requirements of subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) relative to a holder of a power of appointment who is also a fiduciary and subdivision (a)(3) does not do so.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) varies significantly from the Uniform Trust Code. Prior to the effective date of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code on July 1, 2004, Tennessee already had in effect a procedure for providing notification of the creation of a trust and similar matters. That provision can be found at repealed T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c50s35-50-119" target="_self">35-50-119</a></cite>. The portions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code relative to notification of creation of a trust and similar matters is based on that prior language and not on the Uniform Trust Code. As with such procedure that existed prior to the effective date of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the requirement of providing such notification under subsection (b) can in certain cases be waived, as can the requirements of subsection (a). Thus unlike the Uniform Trust Code, the restatements and other foreign law of many jurisdictions, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code explicitly allows so-called “quiet” or “silent” trusts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Absent such a waiver, subsection (b) requires that, in most cases, a trustee of an irrevocable trust that is not a grantor trust under subpart E, part 1, subchapter J, of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (i.e., the “grantor trust rules”) inform the current income and vested ultimate beneficiaries, as well as anyone who, in a capacity other than that of a fiduciary, holds a power of appointment (with all such terms having the meanings as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>) within sixty (60) days of the trust’s existence. Such notice must include the trustee’s name, address and telephone number and must contain, in the trustee’s discretion, either a complete copy of the document establishing the trust or an abstract containing the information provided in subdivision (b)(2).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (c) requires that the same information required in subsection (b) be provided to the income beneficiaries who are takers of a terminated interest upon the termination of such interest of any one or more current income benefi-ciaries. At such time certain holders of power of appointment are likewise required to be given the information required by subsection (b).
              </p>
              <p>
               Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) – (c), the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not statutorily take a position on the extent to which a trustee may claim attorney-client privilege against a beneficiary or holder of a power of appointment who has the right under such subsections (a) – (c) seeking discovery of attorney-client communications between the trustee and the trustee's attorney. Nationally, courts are split on this issue and the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code can find no Tennessee case on point.

              <p>
               Nevertheless, for the following reasons it is believed that overall Tennessee law gravitates toward the view that the fiduciary and not the beneficiary is the client:
              </p>
              <p>
               Such is the traditional majority rule in the United States. See Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (Boltwood), 990 P.2d 591 (Cal. 2000); Huie v. De Shazo, 922 S.W.2d 920 (Tex. 1996); Spinner v. Nutt, 631 N.E.2d 542 (Mass. 1994); Paskoski v. Johnson, 626 So. 2d 338 (Fla. Ct. App. 4th 1993); First Union Nat’l Bank v. Turney, 824 So. 2d 172 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2001); Murphy v. Gorman, 271 F.R.D. 296 (D.N.M. 2010). While a more recent Supreme Court case includes dicta that there is an exception regarding attorney-client privilege in fiduciary cases, see United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, <cite class="s_court">131 S. Ct. 2313</cite> (2011); such dicta has been reviewed by the Illinois Court of Appeals, which rejected it and found no such exception.. Garvy v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 966 N.E.2d 523 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 2012), Petition for appeal denied, Garvy v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 979 N.E.2d 876 (Ill. 2012).
              </p>
              <p>
               The Tennessee Code contains multiple statutes providing for attorney-client privilege. See T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.23.html#t23c03s23-3-105" target="_blank">23-3-105</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.23.html#t23c03s23-3-106" target="_blank">23-3-106</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c01s67-1-1710" target="_blank">67-1-1710</a></cite>. Moreover, an attorney who violates either of the first two such sections is severely penalized, being guilty of a Class C misdemeanor, and upon conviction stricken from the rolls as a practicing attorney. Finally, the attorney-client privilege is one of the privileges recognized under Tenn. R. Evid. 501 (2013). In response to the above indicated split in opinion, several states have recently explicitly provided by rule or statute that no exception to attorney-client privilege exists in fiduciary cases. See New York Civil Practice: CPLR § 4503; Fl. Stat. 733.212 and 736.0813.

               The overriding emphasis of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is on settlor’s intent and of freedom of disposition. To hold that a beneficiary and not the fiduciary was the “real” client would conflict with the trustee's fiduciary duty to implement the intentions of the settlor, which are sometimes in tension with the wishes of one or more beneficiaries. In order for a trustee to carry out this duty it is sometimes necessary or beneficial for the trustee to seek legal counsel and not being able to assert this privilege might inhibit the trustee from doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
               After all as stated by the Supreme Court of the United States, “[The purpose of the attorney-client privilege] is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.” and “The privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer's being fully informed by the client.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 and 386 (1981).

              <p>
               Express donative trusts, such as those primarily provided for under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code differ from ERISA trusts. Such ERISA trusts apply a theory that the beneficiary is the actual client. See, e.g., United States v. Mett, 178 F.3d 1058, 1062-64 (9th Cir. 1999). However, a pension trust differs from express private trusts because the beneficiaries are the settlors of their own trust, such trust being funded with the beneficiaries’ earnings. Accordingly, in ERISA attorney-client cases “[t]here are no competing interests such as other stockholders or the intentions of the Settlor.” Gibbs & Hanson, 21 ACTEC Notes at 238.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code employs the term “report” instead of “accounting” in order to negate any inference that the report must be prepared in any particular format or with a high degree of formality. The reporting requirement might even be satisfied by providing the beneficiaries with copies of the trust's income tax returns and monthly brokerage account statements if the information on those returns and statements is complete and sufficiently clear. The key factor is not the format chosen but whether the report provides the beneficiaries with the information necessary to protect their interests. For model account forms, together with practical advice on how to prepare reports, see Robert Whitman, Fiduciary Accounting Guide (2d ed. 1998).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (d) allows trustee reports and other required information to be waived by a beneficiary as well as a holder of a power of appointment entitled to receive same. Such beneficiary or holder of a power of appointment may also withdraw a consent. However, a waiver of a trustee's report or other information does not relieve the trustee from accountability and potential liability for matters that the report or other information would have disclosed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (e) provides the mechanism for “quiet” or “silent” trusts. Subsection (a) and (b) do not apply to the ex-tent that the terms of the trust provide otherwise, nor to the extent that the settlor or a trust protector or trust advisor holding the power to so direct, directs otherwise. Additionally under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-303" target="_self">35-15-303</a></cite> a settlor may designate in writing a representative to receive various notices and represent and bind such beneficiaries. The designation of a representative by a settlor may occur subsequent to the execution of the trust instrument, however, it must meet the notice requirements of this section. If the settlor designates a representative to receive notices, the designation should specify that the representative is to receive any reports from the trustee on behalf of the individual beneficiary. Although sub-section (e) only explicitly states that it should apply to subsections (a) and (b), there is no logical reason it should not apply to subsection (c) as well. Subsection (c) only effectively provides such beneficiaries who were not either current income beneficiaries or vested remainder beneficiaries at the time the trust was established with any additional notice. It is only logical that if a settlor, trust advisor or trust protector can direct the withholding of notice to beneficiaries otherwise entitled thereto upon the creation of the trust under subsection (b), such persons should likewise be able to direct such withholding to those who only become current beneficiaries thereafter.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (f) provides the transition rules for the notice and information requirements upon the effective date of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (g) provides that if a trustee is required to keep certain information regarding trust assets confidential the trustee can be assured that he/she can carry out their duty to inform and report to beneficiaries without fear of indirectly breaching the trustee's duty of confidentiality. This is often (but not exclusively) of special importance when a closely held asset is held by a trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               In order to allow directed trusts to operate efficiently, subsection (h) requires that trust advisors, trust protectors and other fiduciaries keep each excluded fiduciary, all as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, reasonably informed about the information reasonably necessary for such fiduciaries to carry out their respective duties.

               Trustees were under a mandatory obligation to distribute the remaining principal of such child's separate trust to such child, when the terminating event or events occurred, and because the trust did not provide otherwise, the trustees were to perform this task expeditiously, which they failed to do; because the trustees failed to take the appropriate actions for two years following the termination of the trust, the trial court was justified in ordering the clerk to prepare a deed to transfer the real estate to the beneficiaries.

              </p>
              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               The provisions of this section diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Relative to section 814 of the Uniform Trust Code, according to ULC – NCCUSL:
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite the breadth of discretion purportedly granted by the wording of a trust, no grant of discretion to a trustee, whether with respect to management or distribution, is ever absolute. A grant of discretion establishes a range with-in which the trustee may act. Moreover, a trustee’s exercise of discretion must always be in good faith.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding the standards for exercising discretion, the Uniform Trust Code refers one to Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 50.
              </p>
              <p>
               Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 50 and the comments thereto contain language that indicates that even if the terms of a trust specifically give a trustee “absolute, sole and unfettered” discretion, a “reasonableness” standard relative to the exercise (or non-exercise) of that discretion must be inferred.
              </p>
              <p>
               As discussed elsewhere in these comments, regardless of how clear and obvious a drafter is regarding a settlor’s in-tent to create a purely and absolutely discretionary trust, the above enumerated views of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and the Uniform Trust Code result in nothing other than a vague “continuum” of rights and discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
               In furtherance of its overriding emphasis on settlor’s intent, freedom of disposition and certainty, as well as for numerous other reasons discussed elsewhere in the comments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such code categorically rejects the above enumerated views of the Restatement (Third) of Trusts and of the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Section (a) provides a definition of “improper motive” as such relates to a trustee who is considering whether or not to make a distribution from a trust, as well as when such trustee need consider a beneficiary’s resources. Section (a) applies to all discretionary, support and mandatory interests.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) contains provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code that only apply to exercise of discretion related to, as well as distributions from, discretionary interests:
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(1), in the clearest words possible, explicitly state that a discretionary interest is not a right or interest that rises to the level of “property.” Instead such interest is nothing more than a “mere expectancy.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision(b)(2) states the sole and only bases on which a court has any jurisdiction to review a trustee’s distribution discretion made relative to a distribution interest. There are three: (i) if a trustee acts dishonestly; (ii) if a trustee acts with an “improper motive,” as such is defined in section (a); or (iii) if a trustee fails to act if under a duty to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(3) is directly contra to the view of the Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts regarding exercise of discretion under a distribution interest. It explicitly states that a reasonableness standard shall not be applied to such discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(4) explicitly states that, other than for the three circumstances listed in subdivision (b)(2), a court has no jurisdiction to review a trustee’s discretion made (or not made) or to force a distribution relative to a discretionary interest.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(5) further assures the statutory intent of subdivisions (b)(1) – (b)(4). It provides that, absent express language in a trust instrument to the contrary, when distribution language in a discretionary interest permits unequal distributions among beneficiaries, or distributions to the exclusion of other beneficiaries, the trustee truly has complete discretion to distribute all income and principal to one (or more) beneficiary and not to the other beneficiaries.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (c) contains provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code that only apply to exercise of discretion related to, as well as distributions from, support or mandatory interests:
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (c)(1) assures that a beneficiary under either such type of interest has an enforceable right to a distribution pursuant to a courts review of whether or not a trustee made such a distribution.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (c)(2) states the sole and only bases on which a court has any jurisdiction to review a trustee’s distribution discretion made relative to a support or mandatory interest. There are four: (i) if a trustee acts unreasonably; (ii) if a trustee acts dishonestly; (iii) if a trustee acts with an “improper motive,” as such is defined in section (a); or (iv) if a trustee fails to act if under a duty to do so. Other than for such four enumerated circumstances, a court has no juris-diction to review whether a trustee made (or did not make) a distribution relative to a support or mandatory interest.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (c)(3) explicitly states that, although a beneficiary under a support interest has the right to a distribution subject to a court’s review under the four bases contained in (c)(4), such support interest still does not rise to the level of a property right or interest.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsections (d) – (f) rewrite the terms of a trust that might otherwise result in adverse estate and gift tax consequences to a beneficiary who is serving as a trustee or other fiduciary. Subsections (d) – (f) vary from the fact that The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not generally address the subject of tax curative provisions. Tax curative provisions are provisions that automatically rewrite the terms of trusts that might otherwise fail to qualify for probable in-tended tax benefits. Tax curative provisions, because they apply to all trusts using or failing to use specified language, are often overbroad, applying not only to trusts intended to qualify for tax benefits but also to smaller trust situations where taxes are not a concern. Enacting tax curative provisions also requires special diligence by the state legislature to make certain that these provisions are periodically amended to account for the frequent changes in federal tax law. Furthermore, many failures to draft with sufficient care may be correctable by including a tax savings clause in the terms of the trust or by seeking modification of the trust using one or more of the methods authorized by sections T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-411" target="_self">35-15-411</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>. Notwithstanding such reasons, the unintended inclusion in a beneficiary’s gross estate of a trust when such beneficiary is also serving as a trustee or other fiduciary is a frequent enough occurrence that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code addresses same herein.
              </p>
              <p>
               A tax curative provision differs from a statute such T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite>, which allows a court to modify a trust to achieve an intended tax benefit. Absent Congressional or regulatory authority authorizing the specific modification, a lower court decree in state court modifying a trust is controlling for federal estate tax purposes only if the decree was issued before the taxing event, which in the case of the estate tax would be the decedent’s death. See Rev. Rul. 73-142, 1973-1 C.B. 405. There is specific federal authority authorizing modification of trusts for a number of reasons (see section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-416" target="_self">35-15-416</a></cite>) but not on the specific issues addressed in this section. Subsections (d) – (f), by interpreting the original language of the trust instrument in a way that qualifies for intended tax benefits, obviates the need to seek a later modification of the trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (d) is applicable unless otherwise provided in section (f) or unless the terms of the trust expressly indicate that a rule in subsection (d) is not to apply.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (d)(1) states that, subject to such exceptions, the power to make discretionary distributions to a beneficiary who is also serving as a trustee or other fiduciary is automatically limited by the requisite ascertainable standard necessary to avoid inclusion of the trust in the beneficiary’s gross estate or result in a taxable gift upon the beneficiary’s release or exercise of the power. Subdivision (f)(2) provides that trusts of which the trustee-beneficiary is also a settlor are not subject to this subdivision. In such a case, limiting the discretion of a settlor-trustee to an ascertain-able standard would not be sufficient to avoid inclusion of the trust in the settlor’s gross estate. Furthermore, the inadvertent inclusion of a trust in the gross estate of a settlor who is also serving as a trustee or other fiduciary is a far less frequent and generally better understood occurrence than is the inadvertent inclusion of the trust in the estate of a non-settlor beneficiary who is also serving as a trustee or other fiduciary.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (d)(2) addresses a common trap that can occur when a trustee or other fiduciary is not a beneficiary, but such trustee or other fiduciary has the power to make discretionary distributions to those to whom such trustee or other fiduciary owes a legal obligation of support. Discretion to make distributions to those to whom the trustee or other fiduciary owes a legal obligation of support, including but not limited to a fiduciary’s minor children, results in inclusion of the trust in the gross estate of the trustee or other fiduciary even if the power is limited by an ascertainable standard. That is because the language of both I.R.C. § 2041(b)(1)(A) and Treas. Reg. § 20.2041-1(c)(2) indicate that the ascertainable standard exception to the definition of a general power of appointment applies only to distributions for the benefit of a decedent (i.e., to a beneficiary who is also a trustee or other fiduciary). Such exception language says nothing regarding distributions to those to whom a decedent (i.e., a trustee or other fiduciary) owes a legal obligation of support.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (e) deals with cotrustees, trust advisors and trust protectors and adopts the common planning technique of granting the broader discretion only to the independent trustee(s), trust advisor(s) or trust protector(s). Cotrustees or other fiduciaries who are beneficiaries of the trust or who have a legal obligation to support a beneficiary may exercise the power only as limited by subsection (d). If all trustees are so limited, the court may appoint a special fiduciary to make a decision as to whether a broader exercise is appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (f) excludes certain trusts from the operation of this section. Trusts qualifying for the marital deduction will be includable in the surviving spouse’s gross estate regardless of whether this section applies. Consequently, if the spouse is acting as a trustee or other fiduciary, there is no need to limit the power of such spouse to make discretionary distributions for the spouse’s benefit. Similar reasoning applies to the revocable trust, which, because of the settlor’s power to revoke, is automatically includable in the settlor’s gross estate even if the settlor is not named as a beneficiary.
              </p>
              <p>
               QTIP marital trusts are subject to this section, however. QTIP trusts qualify for the marital deduction only if so elected on the federal estate tax return. Excluding a QTIP for which an election has been made from the operation of this section would allow the terms of the trust to be modified after the settlor’s death. By not making the QTIP election, an otherwise unascertainable standard would be limited. By making the QTIP election, the trustee's discretion would not be curtailed. This ability to modify a trust depending on elections made on the federal estate tax return could itself constitute a taxable power of appointment resulting in inclusion of the trust in the surviving spouse’s gross estate.
              </p>
              <p>
               The exclusion of an I.R.C. § 2503(c) [<cite class="us_code">26 U.S.C. § 2503(c)</cite>]  minors trust is necessary to avoid loss of gift tax bene-fits. While preventing a trustee from distributing trust funds in discharge of a legal obligation of support would keep the trust out of the trustee’s gross estate, such a restriction might result in loss of the gift tax annual exclusion for contributions to the trust, even if the trustee were otherwise granted unlimited discretion. See Rev. Rul. 69-345, 1969-1 C.B. 226.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

              Supreme Court of Tennessee agrees with the observation that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-101" target="_self">35-15-101</a></cite> et seq. (2015), does not specifically speak to predispute arbitration agreements. Nevertheless, considering the long history that predates the Uniform Trust Code, the reasons for the promulgation of the Uniform Trust Code, the breadth of the powers specifically accorded to trustees under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code provisions, the admonition in the Comments that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code was intended to accord trustees the broadest possible powers, and the Comments indicating the drafters'  approval of arbitration as a means to decide disputes, the Supreme Court concludes that the legislature intended for the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to give trustees the power to enter into predispute arbitration agreements.

             </p>
             <p>
              This section is intended to grant trustees the broadest possible powers, but to be exercised always in accordance with the duties of the trustee and any limitations or expansion of such powers or duties as stated in the terms of the trust. This broad authority is denoted by granting the trustee the powers of an unmarried competent owner of individually owned property, unlimited by restrictions that might be placed on it by marriage, disability, or cotenancy.
             </p>
             <p>
              The powers conferred elsewhere in this Code that are subsumed under this section include all of the specific powers listed in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite> as well as other powers described elsewhere in the Tennessee trust statutes. For non-exclusive examples of other such subsumed powers see: the power to transfer principal place of administration as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-108" target="_self">35-15-108</a></cite>; the power to terminate and uneconomic trust with value less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>; the power to combine and divide trusts as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-417" target="_self">35-15-417</a></cite>; the power to delegate to a cotrustee to the extent provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-703" target="_self">35-15-703</a></cite>; the power to enter into transactions under the exceptions to the duty of loyalty as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802" target="_self">35-15-802</a></cite>; the power to delegate to agents powers and duties as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-807" target="_self">35-15-807</a></cite>; as well as the power to invest trust assets jointly with an-other trust as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-810ol1d" target="_self">35-15-810(d)</a></cite> and the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act. The powers conferred by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code may be exercised without court approval. If court approval of the exercise of a power is desired, a petition for court approval should be filed.
             </p>
             <p>
              A power differs from a duty. A duty imposes an obligation or a mandatory prohibition. A power, on the other hand, is a discretion, the exercise of which is not obligatory. The existence of a power, however created or granted, does not speak to the question of whether it is prudent under the circumstances to exercise the power.

               Signature of the trustee of on an investment/brokerage account agreement agreeing to arbitration did not bind the minor beneficiary to conduct arbitration of unknown future disputes or claims because although the plain language of the trust agreement allowed the trustee to agree to arbitrate claims and disputes that had arisen, it did not allow the trustee to agree to arbitration of unknown future disputes or claims.

               Because plaintiffs could not file suit as the beneficiaries of the trust under this statute, their request for leave to amend the complaint to add a second cause of action in which they claimed that the debt at issue was an asset of the decedent's trust was properly denied as plaintiffs still lacked the capacity to file suit.

              <p>
               Plaintiffs'  claims were properly dismissed with prejudice as plaintiffs lacked the capacity to prosecute their complaint because plaintiffs failed to obtain letters testamentary prior to filing suit as the personal representatives of the decedent's estate; and plaintiffs were not entitled to file suit as the beneficiaries of the trust because only the trustee could prosecute or defend an action, claim, or judicial proceeding.

              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section enumerates specific powers commonly included in trust instruments and in trustee powers legislation. All the powers listed are freely subject to alteration, reduction or expansion in the terms of the trust, subject only to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>. The powers listed are also subsumed under the general authority granted in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-815ol1a" target="_self">35-15-815(a)</a></cite> to exercise all powers over the trust property which an unmarried competent owner has over individually owned property, and any other powers appropriate to achieve the proper management, investment, and distribution of the trust property. With the exception of a trustee’s power of appointment under subdivision (b)(27), the powers listed add little of substance not already granted by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-815" target="_self">35-15-815</a></cite> and powers conferred elsewhere in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, including those listed in the Section Comment to section T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-815" target="_self">35-15-815</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               As provided in subsection T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-815" target="_self">35-15-815</a></cite>, the exercise of a power is subject to fiduciary duties except as modified, limited or expanded in the terms of the trust. The fact that the trustee has a power does not imply a duty that the power must be exercised.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many of the powers listed in this section are similar to the powers listed in Section 3 of the Uniform Trustees’ Powers Act (1964). Several are new, however, and other powers drawn from such act have been updated. The powers enumerated in this section may be divided into categories. Certain powers, such as the powers to acquire or sell property, borrow money, and deal with real estate, securities, and business interests, are powers that any individual can exercise. Other powers, such as the power to collect trust property, are by their very nature only applicable to trustees. Other specific powers, particularly those listed in other sections of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, modify a trustee duty that would otherwise apply. See, e.g ., the exceptions to the duty of loyalty provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802" target="_self">35-15-802</a></cite> and the authorization of a trustee to make joint investments with another trust, which is an exception to earmarking requirement, provided for in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-810" target="_self">35-15-810</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) has no counterpart in the Uniform Trust Code. It was included in this section to assure that instruments written before the original adoption of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in 2004 would obtain the benefits of the provisions of this section as well as those of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c50s35-50-110" target="_self">35-50-110</a></cite>, such latter section being the primary section providing a list of powers that could be incorporated into an instrument by reference prior to adoption of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) acknowledges the ability of a settlor to freely modify, expand or reduce the powers included therein in its introductory phrase.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(1) authorizes a trustee to collect trust property and collect or decline additions to the trust property. The power to collect trust property is an incident of the trustee’s duty to administer the trust as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite>. The trustee has a duty to enforce claims as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-811" target="_self">35-15-811</a></cite>, the successful prosecution of which can result in collection of trust property. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-812" target="_self">35-15-812</a></cite>, the trustee also has a duty to collect trust property from a former trustee or other person holding trust property. For a non-exclusive application of the power to reject additions to the trust property, see the provisions of this subsection that grant a fiduciary the power to decline property with possible environmental liability.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(2) authorizes a trustee to sell trust property, for cash or on credit, at public or private sale. Under the Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 190 (1992), a power of sale is implied unless limited in the terms of the trust. In arranging a sale, a trustee must comply with the duty to act prudently as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite>. This duty may dictate that the sale be made with security.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(4) authorizes a trustee to deposit funds in an account in a regulated financial service institution. This includes the right of a financial institution trustee to deposit funds in its own banking department as authorized by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-802" target="_self">35-15-802</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(5) authorizes a trustee to borrow money. Under the Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 191 (1992), the sole limitation on such borrowing is the general obligation to invest prudently. Language clarifying that the loan may extend beyond the duration of the trust was added to negate an older view that the trustee only had power to encumber the trust property for the period that the trust was in existence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(6) authorizes the trustee to continue, contribute additional capital to, or change the form of a business. Any such decision by the trustee must be made in light of the standards of the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act, but such standards can be fully altered, expanded, reduced or eliminated pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(7), regarding powers with respect to securities, codifies and amplifies the principles of Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 193  (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(9), authorizing the leasing of property, negates the older view, reflected in Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 189  cmt. c (1959), that a trustee could not lease property beyond the duration of the trust. Whether a longer term lease is appropriate is judged by the standards of prudence applicable to all investments.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(10), authorizing a trustee to grant options with respect to sales, leases or other dispositions of property, negates the older view, reflected in Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 190  cmt. k (1959), that a trustee could not grant another person an option to purchase trust property. Like any other investment decision, whether the granting of an option is appropriate is a question of prudence under the standards of the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act, but such standards can be fully altered, expanded, reduced or eliminated pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(11), authorizing a trustee to purchase insurance, empowers a trustee to implement the duty to pro-tect trust property. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-809" target="_self">35-15-809</a></cite>. The trustee may also insure beneficiaries, agents, and the trustee against liability, including liability for breach of trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(13) is one of several provisions in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code designed to address trustee concerns about possible liability for violations of environmental law. This subdivision collects all the powers relating to environmental concerns in one place even though some of the powers, such as the powers to pay expenses, compromise claims, and decline property, overlap with other subdivisions of this section (decline property, subdivision (b)(1); compromise claims, subdivision (b)(14); pay expenses, subdivision (b)(15)). See also  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite>, which grants a designated trustee the power to inspect property to determine potential violation of environmental or other law or for any purpose, and the fact that under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> (unlike under the corresponding section of the Uniform Trust Code) a trustee is not personally liable for violation of environmental law arising from ownership or control of trust property.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(14) authorizes a trustee to pay, contest, settle, or release claims. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-811" target="_self">35-15-811</a></cite>] requires that a trustee need take only “reasonable” steps to enforce claims, meaning that a trustee may release a claim not only when it is uncollectible, but also when collection would be uneconomic. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 192  (1959) (power to compromise, arbitrate and abandon claims). T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-811" target="_self">35-15-811</a></cite> also allows a trustee to abandon or assign a claim such trustee believes unreasonable to enforce to one or more of the beneficiaries of a trust, giving such beneficiary(ies) the ability to attempt enforcement if such beneficiary(ies) so desire(s).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(15), among other things, authorizes a trustee to pay compensation to the trustee and agents without prior approval of court. Regarding the standard for setting trustee compensation and repayment of trustee expenditures, see  T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-708" target="_self">35-15-708</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-709" target="_self">35-15-709</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(16) authorizes a trustee to make elections with respect to taxes. It is intended to allow a trustee as well as any other fiduciary (as such term is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c05s35-5-103" target="_self">35-5-103</a></cite>) who holds the relevant powers, the broadest possible freedom consistent with overall objectives and provisions of the Tennessee trust statutes to exercise elections concerning taxes so that such fiduciary can provide for the overall efficient administration of a trust. Due to the intent of subdivision (b)(16), it would be illogical to limit its application to only matters that are only directly related to taxation and it application is not so limited. Accordingly, although not specifically enumerated in such subdivision, such subdivision (as well as other portions of the Tennessee trust statutes) grants a fiduciary the powers to make decisions regarding all things and matters that directly or indirectly affect taxation imposed on a trust, any of its property, any parties to the trust and any of its beneficiaries. For similar reasons, it would be illogical to limit the application of subdivision (b)(16) to only “federal, state and local taxes,” and its application is not so limited. Accordingly, although not specifically enumerated in such subdivision, such subdivision grants a fiduciary the power to exercise elections regarding all forms of taxation (regardless of name, as well as how and on what basis imposed) that is imposed on the trust, any of its property, any parties to the trust and any of its beneficiaries. Such power exists regardless of the nature or location (whether within this state, another state, the United States or within a foreign country, as well as within any subdivisions of any such locations) of the authority imposing or interpreting any form of taxation. Although not limited to taxes imposed on income, among other such elections, such subdivision specifically authorizes a trustee to make elections which relate to current, recent and future changes to the definition of “income” (as well as to the definition of any other term bearing on the taxability of any item or matter and the resulting rate or amount of tax, under any type or form of taxation). Several non-exclusive examples of such changes include: a definition of income such as an election to consider the net gains form the sale of capital assets to be part of “distributable net income” (often referred to by the acronym “DNI”) as such is defined in § 643 of the Internal Revenue Code; and any changes to matters affecting any definitions or other provisions contained in subpart D, part 1, subchapter J, of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (i.e., the provisions of such code concerning treatment of excess distributions by trusts, including but not limited to accumulation distributions and undistributed net income, the latter often referred to by the acronym “UNI”). To the extent any provision of title 35, chapter 6, any other provision of the Tennessee trust statutes, any other Tennessee law or any foreign law are in conflict with this subdivision (b)(16), such subdivision (b)(16) controls.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(17) authorizes a trustee to take action with respect to employee benefit or retirement plans, or annuities or life insurance payable to the trustee. Typically, these will be beneficiary designations which the settlor has made payable to the trustee, but the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code also allows the trustee to acquire ownership of annuities or life insurance. Moreover, elections under this subdivision may be made in order to effect the other provisions of this section, including but not limited to subdivision (b)(16).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivisions (b)(18) and (b)(19) allow a trustee to make loans to a beneficiary or to guarantee loans of a beneficiary upon such terms and conditions as the trustee considers fair and reasonable. The determination of what is fair and reasonable must be made in light of the fiduciary duties of the trustee and the purposes of the trust. Frequently, a trustee will make loans to a beneficiary which might be considered less than prudent in an ordinary commercial sense although of great benefit to the beneficiary and which help carry out the trust purposes. If the trustee requires security for the loan to the beneficiary, adequate security under this subdivision may consist of a charge on the beneficiary’s interest in the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 255  (1959). It is important to note, that as with the vast majority of provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the provisions of subdivisions (b)(18) and (b)(19) may be modified, expanded, restricted or eliminated, subject only to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(20) authorizes the appointment of ancillary trustees in jurisdictions in which the regularly appointed trustee is unable or unwilling to act. Often, but certainly not exclusively, an ancillary trustee will be appointed when there is a need to manage real estate located in another jurisdiction. This subdivision allows the regularly appointed trustee to select the ancillary trustee and to confer on the ancillary trustee such powers and duties as may be necessary. The appointment of ancillary trustees is a topic which a settlor may wish to address in the terms of the trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(21) authorizes a trustee to make payments to another person for the use or benefit of a beneficiary who is under a legal disability or who the trustee reasonably believes is incapacitated. Although an adult relative or other person receiving funds is required to spend it on the beneficiary’s behalf, it is preferable that the trustee make the distribution to a person having more formal fiduciary responsibilities. For this reason, payment may be made to an adult relative only if the trustee does not know of a conservator, guardian, custodian, or custodial trustee capable of acting for the beneficiary. Subdivision (b)(21) can also be used in furtherance of the provisions of T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-506ol1a5" target="_self">35-15-506(a)(5)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-506ol1b2" target="_self">35-15-506(b)(2)</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(22) authorizes a trustee to make non-pro-rata distributions and allocate particular assets in proportionate or disproportionate shares. This power provides needed flexibility and lessens the risk that a non-pro-rata distribution will be treated as a taxable sale. The power also provides needed flexibility to effect other provisions of this section, including but not limited to subdivision (b)(16).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(23) authorizes a trustee to resolve disputes through mediation or arbitration. The drafters of this the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code encourage the use of such alternate methods for resolving disputes. Arbitration is a form of nonjudicial settlement agreement authorized by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111" target="_self">35-15-111</a></cite>. In representing beneficiaries and others in connection with arbitration or mediation, the representation principles of title 35, chapter 15, part 3 may be applied. Settlors wishing to encourage use of alternate dispute resolution may draft to provide it. For sample language, see  American Arbitration Association, Arbitration Rules for Wills and Trusts (1995).

               Subdivision(b)(25) authorizes a fiduciary to execute and deliver all forms of instruments that facilitate exercise of that fiduciary’s powers.

              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(26), which is similar to section 344 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts  (1959), clarifies that even though the trust has terminated, the trustee retains the powers needed to wind up the administration of the trust and distribute the remaining trust property.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(27) authorizes a trustee who possesses a discretionary power to distribute principal outright to trust beneficiaries to exercise that power in further trust. This power, which is commonly referred to as a “decanting” power, is considered a limited power of appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
               The power may be exercised with respect to any trust that is administered in Tennessee.
              </p>
              <p>
               In order to exercise the power, the Trustee is required to sign a written notarized instrument that is maintained with the records of the original trust as well as the second trust. The Trustee does not have to obtain consent of the beneficiaries or a Court in order to exercise the power.
              </p>
              <p>
               The power may only be exercised in favor of the proper objects of the exercise of the discretionary power. This means that new beneficiaries cannot be added to the second trust, though the second trust does not have to benefit all of the beneficiaries of the original trust. The second trust may grant a power of appointment to a beneficiary of the original trust, which power may be exercisable in favor of beneficiaries who were not beneficiaries of the original trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are several limitations on the exercise of the power that prevent loss of tax benefits:
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

              Trustees were under a mandatory obligation to distribute the remaining principal of such child's separate trust to such child, when the terminating event or events occurred, and because the trust did not provide otherwise, the trustees were to perform this task expeditiously, which they failed to do; because the trustees failed to take the appropriate actions for two years following the termination of the trust, the trial court was justified in ordering the clerk to prepare a deed to transfer the real estate to the beneficiaries.

              Section Comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-817" target="_self">35-15-817</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              This section contains several independent provisions governing distribution upon termination. Certain other provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code relevant to distribution upon termination include the power upon termination of a trust to windup administration and distribution subdivision as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816ol1b" target="_self">35-15-816(b)</a></cite>, and the limitation on actions against trustees as provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite>.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (a) is based on section 3-906(b) of the Uniform Probate Code. It addresses the dilemma that sometimes arises when the trustee is reluctant to make distribution until the beneficiary approves but the beneficiary is reluctant to approve until the assets are in hand. The procedure made available under subsection (a) facilitates the making of non-pro-rata distributions. However, whenever practicable it is normally better practice to obtain the advance written con-sent of the beneficiaries to a proposed plan of distribution. Similar to other notices under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, the right of a beneficiary to object may be barred by delivery of the proposal to another person if that other person may represent and bind the beneficiary as provided in title 35, chapter 3.
             </p>
             <p>
              The last sentence of subsection (a) is not contained in the Uniform Trust Code and provides certainty as to the date on which a proposed distribution, having been sent, was received by the person or persons to whom its delivery was required.
             </p>
             <p>
              The failure of a beneficiary to object to a plan of distribution pursuant to subsection (a) is not a release as provided in subsection (c) or in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>. A release requires an affirmative act by a beneficiary and is not accomplished upon a mere failure to object. Furthermore, a failure of a beneficiary to object does not preclude the beneficiary from bringing an action with respect to matters not disclosed in the proposal for distribution.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (b) recognizes that upon an event terminating or partially terminating a trust, expeditious distribution should be encouraged to the extent reasonable under the circumstances. However, a trustee is entitled to retain a reasonable reserve for payment of debts, expenses, and taxes. Sometimes these reserves must be quite large, for example, upon the death of the beneficiary of a QTIP trust that is subject to federal estate tax in the beneficiary’s estate. Not infrequently, a substantial reserve must be retained until the estate tax audit is concluded several years after the beneficiary’s death.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subsection (c) is an application of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>, which addresses the validity of any type of release that a beneficiary might give. However, subsection (c) is more limited, dealing only with releases given upon termination of the trust. Factors affecting the validity of a release are provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-109" target="_self">35-15-109</a></cite>, and such release may be obtained through represented under part 3. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 216  (1959).

                General Comment.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to ULC - NCCUSL, this part provides a place for a jurisdiction to enact, reenact or codify its version of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act [ULC - NCCUSL does not mention the Uniform Principal and Income Act relative to its part 9]. States adopting the Uniform Trust Code which have previously enacted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act are encouraged to reenact their version of the Prudent Investor Act in this part.
               </p>
               <p>
                Both the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002, title 35, part 14, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-101" target="_self">35-14-101</a></cite> et seq., and Tennessee's version of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, title 35, part 6, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c06s35-6-101" target="_self">35-6-101</a></cite> et seq., were adopted prior to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. As with the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, both have been amended since their respective enactments and in certain cases, both diverge, sometimes significantly, from their respective uniform codes, as well as from various restatements. Instead of “reenacting” the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 2002 in part 9, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code incorporates therein by reference such act, codified at title 35, part 14, as well as Tennessee’s version of the Uniform Principal and Income Act, codified at title 35, part 6.

              <p>
               T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001" target="_self">35-15-1001</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite> identify the remedies for breach of trust, describe how money damages for breach of trust, as well as in absence of breach of trust, are to be determined, and specify potential defenses. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001" target="_self">35-15-1001</a></cite> lists the remedies for breach of trust and specifies when a breach of trust occurs. A breach of trust occurs when the trustee breaches one of the duties contained in part 8 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-817" target="_self">35-15-817</a></cite>]  or elsewhere in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. The remedies for breach of trust in T.C.A. § 35-15-1001 are broad and flexible. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002" target="_self">35-15-1002</a></cite> provides how money damages for breach of trust are to be determined. Subject to several exceptions, the standard for determining money damages rests on two principles: (1) the trust should be restored to the position it would have been in had the harm not occurred; and (2) the trustee should not be permitted to profit from the trustee's own wrong. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1003" target="_self">35-15-1003</a></cite> is in contravention to the similarly numbered section of the Uniform Trust Code and holds that a trustee is not liable to a beneficiary in absence of breach of trust for a loss or depreciation of value of trust property or for not making a profit; a trustee not being an insurer. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1004" target="_self">35-15-1004</a></cite> reaffirms the court’s power in equity to award costs and attorney’s fees as justice requires and unlike the Uniform Trust Code, recognizes the need to also allow such payments from trust assets in non-judicial proceedings, arbitrations and mediations.

               T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite> deal with potential defenses. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite> provides a statute of limitations on actions against a trustee that diverges from that of the Uniform Trust Code. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105" target="_self">35-15-105</a></cite>: (1) makes the benefit of such statute of limitations easier to obtain than under the Uniform Trust Code; and (2) unlike the Uniform Trust Code, contains similar statutes of limitation that apply to actions by a trustee against another or former trustee, as well as to actions by a trust advisor or trust protector against a trustee. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1006" target="_self">35-15-1006</a></cite> protects a trustee who acts in reasonable reliance on the terms of a written trust instrument. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1007" target="_self">35-15-1007</a></cite> protects a trustee who has exercised reasonable care to ascertain the happening of events that might affect distribution, such as a beneficiary’s marriage or death. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite> describes the effect and limits on the use of an exculpatory clause. Unlike under the Uniform Trust Code and despite the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite>, as discussed in the section comments to such section, the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code believe that when taken as a whole, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code allows enforceability of a provision in a trust instrument that relieves a trustee of liability for breach committed in bad faith. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite> deals with the standards for recognizing beneficiary approval of, or consent to, acts of the trustee that might otherwise constitute a breach of trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> – 1013 address trustee relations with persons other than beneficiaries. The emphasis is on encouraging third parties to engage in commercial transactions to the same extent as if the property were not held in trust. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> negates personal liability on contracts entered into by the trustee if the fiduciary capacity was properly disclosed. The trustee is also relieved from personal liability for torts committed in the course of administration unless the trustee was personally at fault. Unlike the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § 35-15-1010 requires that in order for such personal liability for tort to arise, the fault of the trustee must be due to the trustee’s own willful misconduct proven by clear and convincing evidence. Also unlike the Uniform Trust Code, T.C.A. § 35-15-1010 does not contain an exception to protection from personal liability relative to environmental law. Therefore, T.C.A. § 35-15-1010 provides a trustee significantly better protection from personal liability than does the Uniform Trust Code. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1011" target="_self">35-15-1011</a></cite> negates personal liability for contracts entered into by partnerships in which the trustee is a general partner as long as the fiduciary capacity was disclosed in the contract or partnership certificate. Such section also provides a trustee protection from entity tort claims based on the same standard as in T.C.A. § 35-15-1010. By analogy, the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code believe such protection extends to a trustee of a trust that is the only member of a single member LLC should the LLC itself not protect the trustee. Such drafters also believe such protection is extended to a trustee of a trust that owns an interest in any entity that normally provides limitation of liability, but which is attacked by any alter ego or veil piercing theory. Overall T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1011" target="_self">35-15-1011</a></cite> provides a trustee better protection than does the Uniform Trust Code. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite> protects persons other than beneficiaries who deal with a trustee in good faith and without knowledge that the trustee is exceeding or improperly exercising a power. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> permits a third party to rely on a certification of trust, thereby reducing the need for a third party to request a copy of the complete trust instrument. However, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> provides more privacy and more flexibility than does the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1014" target="_self">35-15-1014</a></cite> provides for enforceability of no-contest provisions and does not have a counterpart in the Uniform Trust Code. Such section provides in the absence of a specific list of grounds for bringing an action, a no-contest provision is valid and enforceable. Moreover, the good or bad faith of the person contesting is not relevant.

               Though much of this part is not subject to override in the terms of the trust, in the interest of enforcing a settlor’s intent and the freedom of disposition of property, more is subject to override than under the Uniform Trust Code. The settlor may not limit the rights of persons other than beneficiaries as provided in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite>, modify the provisions regarding statutes of limitation contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1005" target="_self">35-15-1005</a></cite> nor interfere with the court’s ability to take such action to remedy a breach of trust as may be necessary in the interests of justice.

               This section codifies the remedies available to rectify or to prevent a breach of trust for violation of a duty owed to a beneficiary. The duties that a trustee might breach include those contained in part 8 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-817" target="_self">35-15-817</a></cite> ] in addition to those specified elsewhere in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. In consulting part 8 or other provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, note that certain provisions in part 8 and elsewhere in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. Such divergence may reduce or enlarge a trustee’s duties relative to the duties as defined by the Uniform Trust Code or the restatements. To the extent such divergence is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

               While this section identifies the available remedies, it does not attempt to cover the refinements and exceptions developed in case law. The availability of a remedy in a particular circumstance will be determined not only by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, but also by the common law of trusts and principles of equity to the extent provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106" target="_self">35-15-106</a></cite>.

              <p>
               Beneficiaries, cotrustees and to the extent they are so authorized, trust advisors and trust protectors, have standing to bring a petition against a trustee or cotrustee to remedy a breach of trust. Similarly such persons have standing to bring a petition to remedy a breach of trust against a relevant trust advisor or trust protector to the extent such trust advisor or trust protector owed a duty giving rise to such petition. Following acceptance of office by a successor trustee or other fiduciary, such successor fiduciary has standing to sue a predecessor for breach of trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 200  (1959). A person who may represent a beneficiary’s interest under part 3 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> ] would have standing to bring a petition on behalf of the person represented. In the case of a charitable trust, those with standing include the state attorney general and a charitable organization expressly designated to receive distributions under the terms of the trust. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-110" target="_self">35-15-110</a></cite> &amp; Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 391  (1959). A person appointed to enforce a trust for an animal or a trust for a noncharitable purpose would have standing to sue for a breach of trust. See  T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, during the period in which a beneficiary is an ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary as such is defined in the definition of “qualified beneficiary” at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> and the section comments thereto, such beneficiary shall not have the standing to petition to remedy a breach of trust or to enforce a trust; such beneficiary’s interest being too remote. If and when the interests of any ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary have ripened to the point that such beneficiary is eligible to receive, or have paid for their benefit, current distributions of income or principal, at such time they will no longer be an “ultimate beneficiary” or “potential ultimate beneficiary.” At such time such beneficiary has all the rights of any other current beneficiary of the same type, charitable or non-charitable. Similarly if a trust for animals or a trust for a noncharitable purpose (individually and collectively, “purpose trust”) is an ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary, the rights of any person provided in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-408" target="_self">35-15-408</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-409" target="_self">35-15-409</a></cite> to enforce the trust under which such purpose trust is an ultimate, or potential ultimate beneficiary will not ripen until such purpose trust is eligible to receive from the trust under which it was previously an ultimate, or potential ultimate, beneficiary, current distributions of income or principal.

               Traditionally, remedies for breach of trust at law were limited to suits to enforce unconditional obligations to pay money or deliver chattels. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 198  (1959). Otherwise, remedies for breach of trust were exclusively equitable, and as such, punitive damages were not available and findings of fact were made by the judge and not a jury. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 197  (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               The remedies identified in this section are derived from Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 199  (1959). The reference to payment of money in subdivision (b)(3) includes liability that might be characterized as damages, restitution, or surcharge. For the measure of liability, see  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002" target="_self">35-15-1002</a></cite>. Subdivision (b)(5) makes explicit the court’s authority to appoint a special fiduciary, also sometimes referred to as a receiver. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 199(d)  (1959). The authority of the court to appoint a special fiduciary is not limited to actions alleging breach of trust but is available whenever the court, exercising its equitable jurisdiction, concludes that an appointment would promote administration of the trust. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-704" target="_self">35-15-704</a></cite> (special fiduciary may be appointed whenever court considers such appointment necessary for administration).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subdivision (b)(8), which allows the court to reduce or deny compensation, is in accord with Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 243  (1959). For the factors to consider in setting the compensation of a trustee or other fiduciary absent breach of trust, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-708" target="_self">35-15-708</a></cite>. In deciding whether to reduce or deny a trustee compensation, the court may wish to consider: (1) whether the trustee acted in good faith; (2) whether the breach of trust was intentional; (3) the nature of the breach and the extent of the loss; (4) whether the trustee has restored the loss; and (5) the value of the trustee’s services to the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 243  cmt. c (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               The authority under subdivision (b)(9) to set aside wrongful acts of the trustee is a corollary of the power to enjoin a threatened breach as provided in subdivision (b)(2). However, in setting aside the wrongful acts of the trustee the court may not impair the rights of bona fide purchasers protected under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite>. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 284  (1959).

              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002" target="_self">35-15-1002</a></cite>.

              <p>
               The exception language in the clause at the beginning of subsection (a) may result in a divergence from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any re-statement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) is based on Restatement (Third) of Trusts: Prudent Investor Rule § 205 (1992). Such subsection states the general rule that if a trustee commits a breach of trust, the beneficiaries may either affirm the transaction or, if a loss has occurred, hold the trustee liable for the amount necessary to compensate fully for the consequences of the breach. This may include recovery of lost income, capital gain, or appreciation that would have resulted from proper administration. Even if a loss has not occurred, the trustee may not benefit from the improper action and is accountable for any profit the trustee made by reason of the breach.
              </p>
              <p>
               Notwithstanding the above, subsection (a) has two sources of exceptions to the general rule:
              </p>
              <p>
               Exception number one is the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-117ol1a" target="_self">35-3-117(a)</a></cite> – (d), which since 1951 have been part of the Tennessee trust statutes. Such subdivisions provide:

                 Exception number two is except as provided otherwise in this chapter 15, which by way of incorporation by reference includes chapters 6 and 14, the Tennessee Uniform Principal and Income Act and the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act, respectfully. Because of the flexibility contained in such Tennessee trust statutes (freedom of settlor’s intent, freedom of settlor’s variance from the terms of such Tennessee trust statutes, directed trusts, etc.) it is quite possible that a given trust contains exceptions that apply to the general rule. Such is far more likely under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code than under the Uniform Trust Code or the restatements.

A trustee who has committed a breach of trust is entitled to reasonable compensation for administering the trust unless the court reduces or denies the trustee compensation pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1001ol1b8" target="_self">35-15-1001(b)(8)</a></cite>.

                <p>
                 Subsection (b) is based on Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 258  (1959). Cotrustees are jointly and severally liable for a breach of trust if there was joint participation in the breach. Joint and several liability also is imposed on a nonparticipating cotrustee who, as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-703" target="_self">35-15-703</a></cite>, failed to exercise reasonable care: (1) to prevent a cotrustee from committing a serious breach of trust, or (2) to compel a cotrustee to redress a serious breach of trust. Joint and several liability normally carries with it a right in any trustee to seek contribution from a cotrustee to the extent the trustee has paid more than the trustee’s proportionate share of the liability. Subsection (b), consistent with Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 258  (1959), creates an exception. A trustee who was substantially more at fault or committed the breach of trust in bad faith (absent being exculpated from same under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite>, see section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite>) or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries is not entitled to contribution from the other trustees.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Determining degrees of comparative fault is a question of fact. The fact that one trustee was more culpable or more active than another does not necessarily establish that this trustee was substantially more at fault. Nor is a trustee substantially less at fault because the trustee did not actively participate in the breach. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 258  cmt. e(195). Among the factors to consider: (1) Did the trustee fraudulently induce the other trustee to join in the breach? (2) Did the trustee commit the breach intentionally while the other trustee was at most negligent? (3) Did the trustee, because of greater experience or expertise, control the actions of the other trustee? (4) Did the trustee alone commit the breach with liability imposed on the other trustee only because of an improper delegation or failure to properly monitor the actions of the cotrustee? See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 258  cmt. d (1959).

              </p>
              <p>
               A trustee is not an insurer. Similar to Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 204  (1959), this section provides that absent a breach of trust a trustee is not liable for a loss or depreciation in the value of the trust property or for failure to make a profit.

               By way of example of such contravention, the Uniform Trust Code (but not the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code) contains two subsections, one of which is in accord with this section, while the other subsection in the Uniform Trust Code (but not in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code) states, “A trustee is accountable to an affected beneficiary for any profit made by the trustee arising from the administration of the trust, even absent a breach of trust.”

               Awarding of attorneys'  fees to a trustee and the trustees'  child in a dispute over the conveyance of real property held in a testamentary trust to the child was appropriate because (1) the action involved the administration of the trust; (2) the attorneys'  fees were reasonable, necessary, and properly supported by affidavit of counsel; and (3) justice and equity permitted the award. Furthermore, the estate of the decedent had sufficient funds to incur the attorneys'  fees and expenses. In re Conservatorship of Cross, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 449 (Tenn. Ct.

               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1004" target="_self">35-15-1004</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) codifies the court’s historic authority to award costs and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees, in judicial proceedings grounded in equity. The court may award a party its own fees and costs from the trust. The court may also charge a party’s costs and fees against another party to the litigation. Generally, litigation expenses were at common law chargeable against another party only in the case of egregious conduct such as bad faith or fraud. With respect to a party’s own fees, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-709" target="_self">35-15-709</a></cite> authorizes a trustee to recover expenditures properly incurred in the administration of the trust. The court may award a beneficiary litigation costs if the litigation is deemed beneficial to the trust. Sometimes, litigation brought by a beneficiary involves an allegation that the trustee has committed a breach of trust. On other occasions, the suit by the beneficiary is brought because of the trustee’s failure to take action against a third party, such as to recover property properly belonging to the trust. For the authority of a beneficiary to bring an action when the trustee fails to take action against a third party, see Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 281-282 (1959). For the case law on the award of attorney’s fees and other litigation costs, see 3 Austin W. Scott &amp; William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 188.4 (4th ed. 1988).

               Subsections (b) and (c), for which the Uniform Trust Code has no equivalent, recognizes that there is also a need to allow the payment of fees, expenses and costs from trust assets in non-judicial proceedings, arbitrations and mediations, such being encouraged under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

Instead, the statute provides that the one-year period begins to run on the date a report is sent to the beneficiary that provides sufficient information to put the beneficiary on notice to inquire into the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust.

               The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               The one-year and three year limitations periods under this section are not the only means for barring an action by a beneficiary. A beneficiary may be foreclosed by consent, release, or ratification as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>. Claims may also be barred by principles such as estoppel and laches arising in equity under the common law of trusts. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-106" target="_self">35-15-106</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               The representative referred to in subsection (a) is the person who may represent and bind a beneficiary as provided in part 3 [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-301" target="_self">35-15-301</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-305" target="_self">35-15-305</a></cite> ]. During the time that a trust is revocable and the settlor has capacity, the person holding the power to revoke is the one who must receive the report. See  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-603" target="_self">35-15-603</a></cite> (rights of settlor of revocable trust).
              </p>
              <p>
               This section addresses only the issue of when the clock will start to run for purposes of the statute of limitations. If the trustee wishes to foreclose possible claims immediately, a consent to the report or other information may be obtained pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1009" target="_self">35-15-1009</a></cite>. For the provisions relating to the duty to report to beneficiaries, see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-803" target="_self">35-15-803</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) applies only if the trustee has furnished a report. The one-year statute of limitations does not begin to run against a beneficiary who has waived the furnishing of a report as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>. Moreover, unlike in the similar provision in the Uniform Trust Code, subsection (a) does not require that the trustee’s report disclose the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust, but only that such report disclose “facts indicating” such existence, nor does subsection (a) require a trustee’s report apprise a beneficiary of the time allowed to commence a proceeding.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) defines what information must be contained in a trustee’s report for such to be adequate disclosure. Such subsection requires less than does the similar provision of the Uniform Trust Code. First, such report need only disclose “facts indicating” the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust (as opposed to the existence…). Second, such report need only contain such information that a beneficiary or the beneficiary’s representative will be presumed to know of, or that puts a beneficiary or the beneficiary’s representative on notice to inquire into, the existence of a potential claim. Under the Uniform Trust Code, there is no “presumption” or “notice to inquire” language.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (c) is intended to provide some ultimate repose for actions against a trustee. It applies to cases in which the trustee has failed to report to the beneficiaries or the report did not meet the disclosure requirements of subsection (b). It also applies to beneficiaries who did not receive notice of the report, whether personally or through representation. While the three (3) year limitations period will normally begin to run on termination of the trust, it can also begin earlier. If a trustee leaves office prior to the termination of the trust, the limitations period for actions against that particular trustee begins to run on the date the trustee leaves office. If a beneficiary receives a final distribution prior to the date the trust terminates, the limitations period for actions by that particular beneficiary begins to run on the date of final distribution.
              </p>
              <p>
               If a trusteeship terminates by reason of death, a claim against the trustee’s estate for breach of fiduciary duty would, like other claims against the trustee’s estate, be barred by a probate creditor’s claim statute even though the statutory period prescribed by this section has not yet expired.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsections (d) – (j) have no corresponding provisions in the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsections (d) – (f) provide similar statutes of limitations for actions by a trustee against another trustee or former trustee.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsections (g) – (i) provide similar statutes of limitations for actions by a trust advisor or trust protector against a trustee or former trustee.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (j) provides that if the statute of limitations has run against all beneficiaries, then regardless of the existence of a breach or potential breach, no trustee, trust advisor or trust protector may bring an action for such against any trustee or former trustee.

               This section does not specifically provide that the statutes of limitations under this section are tolled for fraud or other misdeeds, the drafters preferring to leave the resolution of this question to other law of this state.

              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1006" target="_self">35-15-1006</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               It sometimes happens that the intended terms of the trust differ from the apparent meaning of the trust instrument. This can occur because the court, in determining the terms of the trust, is allowed to consider evidence extrinsic to the trust instrument. See  definition of “terms of a trust” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>. Furthermore, if a trust is reformed on account of mistake of fact or law, as authorized by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-415" target="_self">35-15-415</a></cite>, provisions of a trust instrument can be deleted or contradicted and provisions not in the trust instrument may be added. The concept of the “terms of a trust,” both as defined in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code and as used in the doctrine of reformation, is intended to effectuate the principle that a trust should be administered and distributed in accordance with the settlor’s intent. However, a trustee should also be able to administer a trust with some dispatch and without concern that a reasonable reliance on the terms of the trust instrument is misplaced. This section protects a trustee who so relies on a trust instrument but only to the extent the breach of trust resulted from such reliance. This section is similar to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c14s35-14-103ol1b" target="_self">35-14-103(b)</a></cite>, in the Tennessee Uniform Prudent Investor Act, which protects a trustee from liability to the extent that the trustee acted in reasonable reliance on the provisions of the trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section protects a trustee only if the trustee’s reliance is reasonable. For example, a trustee’s reliance on the trust instrument would not be justified if the trustee is aware of a prior court decree or binding nonjudicial settlement agreement clarifying or changing the terms of the trust.

               This section is designed to encourage trustees to administer trusts expeditiously and without undue concern about liability for failure to ascertain external facts, often of a personal nature, that might affect administration or distribution of the trust. The common law, contrary to this section, imposed absolute liability against a trustee for misdelivery regardless of the trustee’s level of care. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 226  (1959). The events listed in this section are not exclusive. A trustee who has exercised reasonable care to ascertain the occurrence of other events, such as the attainment by a beneficiary of a certain age, is also protected from liability.

               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite>.

              <p>
               To the extent subsection (a) forbids exculpation of a trustee in the case of bad faith, such subsection is in conflict with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite>. Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite>, a settlor can in the terms of a trust override the duty of good faith, such not being a mandatory rule under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite>. Such duty was not included in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> when the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code was originally adopted and such duty has not been added to T.C.A. § 35-15-105(b) in any subsequent amendment thereto.
              </p>
              <p>
               Moreover, it is a primary objective of the Tennessee trust statutes that a settlor’s intent be the lodestar by which a trust is interpreted, that such intent be carried out and that settlors have the freedom to dispose of their assets to whom and in the manner they wish, all to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, unlike with the Uniform Trust Code, there is no duty of good faith imposed by default in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite>, which relates to exercise of discretion. Under such section, the only bases on which a court can review exercise of such discretion relative to a discretionary trust are dishonesty, failure act if under a duty to do so and “improper motive,” which is defined at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814ol1a1" target="_self">35-15-814(a)(1)</a></cite> to only include two specified acts and does not include “bad faith.” Relative to exercise of distribution discretion under a support and mandatory interests, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-804ol1c2" target="_self">35-15-804(c)(2)</a></cite> stipulates four grounds for judicial review. The three listed above for discretionary interests plus “unreasonableness,” and does not add a general prohibition against exculpating a trustee for acting in bad faith or requiring such trustee to act in “good faith.”
              </p>
              <p>
               For all the reasons stated above, the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code are of the opinion that a provision of a trust relieving a trustee of liability for breach is enforceable to the extent such provision relieves the trustee of liability for breach committed in bad faith. Such drafters believe subdivision (a)(1) of this section should read, “Relieves the trustee of liability for breach of trust committed with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries; or”, omitting the words “bad faith.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Absent such override of the duty of good faith in the terms of a trust pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1a" target="_self">35-15-105(a)</a></cite>, such duty is imposed as a default rule in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808ol1d" target="_self">35-15-808(d)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002" target="_self">35-15-1002</a></cite>. Such default rule is likely to be the appropriate one in most circumstances; however, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code honors a settlor’s desire to override such default rule.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) responds to the danger that the insertion of such a clause by the fiduciary or its agent may have been undisclosed or inadequately understood by the settlor. To overcome the presumption of abuse in subsection (b), the trustee must establish that the clause was fair and that its existence and contents were adequately communicated to the settlor. In determining whether the clause was fair, the court may wish to examine: (1) the extent of the prior relationship between the settlor and trustee; (2) whether the settlor received independent advice; (3) the sophistication of the settlor with respect to business and fiduciary matters; (4) the trustee's reasons for inserting the clause; and (5) the scope of the particular provision inserted. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 222  cmt. d (1959).
              </p>
              <p>
               The requirements of subsection (b) are satisfied if the settlor was represented by independent counsel. If the settlor was represented by independent counsel, the settlor’s attorney is considered the drafter of the instrument even if the attorney used the trustee's form. Because the settlor's attorney is an agent of the settlor, disclosure of an exculpatory term to the settlor’s attorney is disclosure to the settlor.

               This section is based on, but also varies from, sections 216 through 218 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts  (1959). It also varies from the similar provision in the Uniform Trust Code.

              <p>
               A consent, release, or affirmance under this section may occur either before or after the approved conduct. This section requires an affirmative act by the beneficiary. A failure to object is not sufficient. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 216  cmt. a (1959). A consent is binding on a consenting beneficiary although other beneficiaries have not consented. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 216  cmt. g (1959). To constitute a valid consent, the beneficiary must know of the beneficiary’s rights and of the material facts relating to the breach. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 216  cmt. k (1959). If the beneficiary’s approval involves a self-dealing transaction, the approval is binding only if the transaction was fair and reasonable. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§ 170(2) , 216(3) & cmt. n (1959).

               The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

              <p>
               This section generally provides more protection against personal liability of a trustee than does the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section is based on section 7-306 of the Uniform Probate Code. However, unlike the Uniform Probate Code, which requires that the contract both disclose the representative capacity and identify the trust, subsection (a) protects a trustee who reveals the fiduciary relationship either by indicating a signature as trustee or by simply referring to the trust. The protection afforded the trustee by this section applies only to contracts that are properly entered into in the trustee's fiduciary capacity, meaning that the trustee is exercising an available power and is not violating a duty.
              </p>
              <p>
               While this section does not excuse any liability the trustee may have for breach of trust, subsection (b) provides that, except in rare circumstances, a trustee in not otherwise personally liable by reason of the trustee acting in a fiduciary capacity of a trust and that any obligations undertaken by the trustee in such fiduciary capacity are enforceable solely against the trust and its property.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsections (c) addresses when a trustee will be personally liable (other than for breach of trust) relative to the trustee’s acting in administering a trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               A trustee will be personally liable for torts committed in the course of administering a trust only if the trustee was personally at fault on account of the trustee’s willful misconduct. Such must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. This is contrary to Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 264  (1959), which imposes liability on a trustee regardless of fault, including liability for acts of agents under respondeat superior. It is also contrary to the relevant provision contained in the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unlike under the Uniform Trust Code, subsection (c) immunizes a trustee from personal liability for violation of environmental law, such as CERCLA (<cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 9607</cite>)  or its state law counterparts, arising from the ownership and control of trust property. For further protection of a fiduciary relative to environmental claims, see  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite> (nominated trustee may investigate trust property to determine potential violation of environmental law without having accepted trusteeship) and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-816" target="_self">35-15-816</a></cite> (trustee powers with respect to possible liability for violation of environmental law). The protections afforded trustees in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-701" target="_self">35-15-701</a></cite> are afforded to trust advisors and trust protectors in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-711" target="_self">35-15-711</a></cite>.

To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.

              <p>
               This section generally provides more protection against personal liability of a trustee than does the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section adds protection in addition to that provided by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1010" target="_self">35-15-1010</a></cite>, which generally protects a trustee from personal liability on contracts that the trustee enters into on behalf of the trust. This section also protects a trustee from personal liability for contracts entered into or torts committed by a general or limited partnership of which the trustee was a general partner.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) protects the trustee from personal liability for such partnership obligations whether the trustee signed the contract or it was signed by another general partner. Subsection (b) protects a trustee from personal liability for torts committed by the partnership unless the trustee was personally at fault. Unlike with the Uniform Trust Code, such fault must be on account of the trustee’s own willful misconduct and such must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Protection from the partnership’s contractual obligations is available under subsection (a) only if the other party is on notice of the fiduciary relationship, either in the contract itself or in the partnership certificate on file.
              </p>
              <p>
               By analogy, the above protection is also provided to a trustee serving a trust that is the sole member of an LLC, should the LLC itself not be found to so protect the trustee. By such analogy, and subject to the provisions of this section, it should also protect a trustee relative to any alter ego or veil piercing theory applied to any form of entity that generally provides limitation on liability.
              </p>
              <p>
               Generally speaking, special protection is not otherwise needed for other business interests that the trustee may own, such as an interest as a limited partner, generally with a membership interest in an LLC, or an interest as a corporate shareholder. In these cases the nature of the entity or the interest owned by the trustee generally carries with it its own limitation on liability. Should such not be the case, then the above analogy should apply to the trustee and the trustee’s position relative to the entity.
              </p>
              <p>
               Certain exceptions apply. The section is not intended to be used as a device for individuals or their families to shield assets from creditor claims. Consequently, subsection (c) excludes from the protections provided by this section trustees who own an interest in a partnership (or subject to the analogy above, in another type of entity) in a capacity other than as trustee. This exception is narrower than that provided by the Uniform Trust Code, which unlike the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, attributes ownership by certain other persons to the trustee.
              </p>
              <p>
               Notwithstanding the above, a revocable trust cannot be used as a device for avoiding claims protected by this section. Subsection (d) imposes personal liability on the settlor of a revocable trust for such claims.

               Section Comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section is derived from section 7 of the Uniform Trustee Powers Act.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) protects two different classes; persons other than beneficiaries who assist a trustee with a transaction, and persons other than beneficiaries who deal with the trustee for value. As long as the assistance was provided or the transaction was entered into in good faith and without knowledge, third persons in either category are protected in the transaction even if the trustee was exceeding or improperly exercising the power. For the definition of “know,” see T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-104" target="_self">35-15-104</a></cite>. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not define “good faith” for purposes of this and the next section. That term is defined at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c01s47-1-201" target="_blank">47-1-201</a></cite>. The definition provided there is consistent with the purpose of this section, which is to treat commercial transactions with trustees similar to other commercial transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (b) confirms that a third party who is acting in good faith is not charged with a duty to inquire into the extent of a trustee’s powers or the propriety of their exercise. The third party may assume that the trustee has the necessary power. Consequently, there is no need to request or examine a copy of the trust instrument. A third party who wishes assurance that the trustee has the necessary authority instead should request a certification of trust as provided in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite>. Subsection (b) is intended to negate the rule, followed by some courts, that a third party is charged with constructive notice of the trust instrument and its contents. The cases are collected in George G. Bogert &amp; George T. Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees § 897 (Rev. 2d ed. 1995); and 4 Austin W. Scott &amp; William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts § 297 (4th ed. 1989).
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (c) protects any person, including a beneficiary, who in good faith delivers property to a trustee. The standard of protection in the Restatement is phrased differently although the result is similar. Under Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 321  (1959), the person delivering property to a trustee is liable if at the time of the delivery the person had notice that the trustee was misapplying or intending to misapply the property.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (d) extends the protections afforded by the section to assistance provided to or dealings for value with a former trustee. The third party is protected the same as if the former trustee still held the office.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (e) clarifies that a statute relating to commercial transactions controls whenever both it and this section could apply to a transaction. Consequently, the protections provided by this section are superseded by T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c08s47-8-101" target="_blank">47-8-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c08s47-8-407" target="_blank">47-8-407</a></cite>. The principal statutes in question are the various chapters of the Uniform Commercial Code, including Chapter 8 on the transfer of securities.

               Section Comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               The provisions of this section in some ways diverge significantly from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               In general, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1013" target="_self">35-15-1013</a></cite> provides for more privacy and more flexibility than does the similar provision of the Uniform Trust Code.
              </p>
              <p>
               In this section, as well as in this section comment, whenever the word “trustee” is used, such word includes any trust advisor or trust protector who holds the power to furnish a certification of trust.
              </p>
              <p>
               This section is an incorporation of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c50s35-50-126" target="_self">35-50-126</a></cite>  [repealed] with the addition of subsection (g) and is designed to protect the privacy of a trust instrument by discouraging requests from persons other than beneficiaries for complete copies of the instrument in order to verify a trustee’s authority. Contrary to section 1013 of the Uniform Trust Code, there is no penalty imposed on the third party for requesting a copy of the full trust instrument in bad faith. Even absent this section, such requests are usually unnecessary. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite>, a third person proceeding in good faith (as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1012" target="_self">35-15-1012</a></cite> and the section comment thereto) is not required to inquire into the extent of the trustee’s powers or the propriety of their exercise. This section adds another layer of protection.
              </p>
              <p>
               Third persons frequently insist on receiving a copy of the complete trust instrument solely to verify a specific and narrow authority of the trustee to engage in a particular transaction. While a testamentary trust, because it is created under a will, is a matter of public record, an inter vivos trust instrument is private. Such privacy is compromised, however, if the trust instrument must be distributed to third persons. A certification of trust is a document signed by a currently acting trustee that may include excerpts from the trust instrument necessary to facilitate the particular transaction. A certification provides the third party with an assurance of authority without having to disclose the trust’s dispositive provisions. Nor is there a need for third persons who may already have a copy of the instrument to pry into its provisions. Persons acting in reliance on a certification may assume the truth of the certification even if they have a complete copy of the trust instrument in their possession.
              </p>
              <p>
               Subsection (a) specifies the required contents of a certification. Subsection (b) clarifies that the certification shall not be required to include the trust’s dispositive provisions. A certification, however, normally will contain the administrative terms of the trust relevant to the transaction. Subsections (d), (e) and (f) protect a third party who relies on the certification. The third party may assume that the certification is true, and is not charged with constructive knowledge of the terms of the trust instrument even if the third party has a copy.

               <p>
                There is no similar section in the Uniform Trust Code. Moreover, the provisions of this section diverge from the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
               </p>
               <p>
                This section was included in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code in furtherance of its overriding policy and goal of carrying out a settlor’s intent, as well as providing settlors with the freedom to dispose of their assets to whom and in the manner they wish, all to the greatest extent constitutionally allowable.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (a) defines “no-contest provision” and states that such term is synonymous with the terms “in terrorem provision” and “forfeiture provision”.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (b) states that a no-contest provision is enforceable according to its express terms, without regard to whether a beneficiary is acting in good or bad faith in taking the action triggering the provisions of the no-contest provision unless probable cause exists for such beneficiary taking such action on eight specific grounds. These grounds are basically the same grounds that, if proven true, would cause the trust to be void in general and not just as to the provisions applicable to the beneficiary taking such action.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (c) contains an explicit list of actions that if taken will not trigger enforceability of the no contest provision. Those actions are:
               </p>
               <p>
                An action brought solely to redress a breach of duty or of trust;
               </p>
               <p>
                Any action brought by a fiduciary unless that fiduciary is a beneficiary against whom the no-contest is other-wise enforceable;
               </p>
               <p>
                Any agreement among the beneficiaries and any other interested persons in settlement of a dispute or in resolution of another matter (other than the no-contest provision), including any nonjudicial settlement agreement; see  T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-111" target="_self">35-15-111</a></cite> for the matters that can be resolved by, as well as the validity of, a nonjudicial settlement agreement;
               </p>
               <p>
                Any action taken for the purpose of determining whether a proposed or pending motion, petition or other proceeding qualifies as a contest that will trigger enforcement of the no-contest provision;
               </p>
               <p>
                Any action by or on behalf of a beneficiary for construction or interpretation of the terms of the trust; and
               </p>
               <p>
                Any action by the attorney general for construction or interpretation of the terms of a trust containing a charitable interest if a provision exists in the trust that would penalize such charitable interest holder for contesting the trust, but only if probable cause exists for instituting such proceedings.
               </p>
              </li>
             </ol>

              If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

              <p>
               As originally adopted, numerous provisions of title 35, chapters 6, 14 and 15 were modified and diverge, in some cases significantly, from their respective uniform codes as well as related restatements. Moreover, there are no uniform code provisions addressing the subjects covered by title 35, chapters 16 and 17, as well of various provisions of chapter 15. Finally, since their initial adoption, various amendments to the Tennessee trust statutes have also been enacted. For example since its initial adoption in 2004, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code underwent amendment in 2005, substantial amendment in 2007, further amendment in 2010 and substantial amendment in 2013. This has resulted in further divergence from uniform law and related restatements, such divergence sometimes being significant. This divergence was undertaken deliberately and after significant consideration. Taken as a whole, the Tennessee trust statutes are a distinct and integrated set of trust laws.

               It is for this reason that the provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> reverse those of section 1101 of the Uniform Trust Code and expressly state that in applying and construing title 35 no consideration shall be given to any need to promote uniformity with respect to its subject matter among states, including relative to the laws of any foreign jurisdiction (as such is defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>) that has enacted versions of the various uniform codes, laws or acts. Moreover, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1101" target="_self">35-15-1101</a></cite> provides that unless specifically provided otherwise in title 35, chapters 6, 14, 15, 16 and 17, courts shall not consult or give any persuasive value to any such uniform acts or any foreign jurisdiction’s acts based on or similar to them; or to the comments of any of them; none of which have any force or effect relative to trusts governed by the laws of Tennessee.

               This section preempts the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. Subdivision 102(a)(2)(B) of such act provides that the federal law can be preempted by a later statute of a state that specifically refers to the federal law. The effect of this section, when enacted as part of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, is to leave to the law of this state the procedures for obtaining and validating an electronic signature. The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not require that any document be in paper form, allowing all documents under such code to be transmitted in electronic form. A properly directed electronic message is a valid method of notice under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code as long as it is reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to result in receipt of the notice or document.

               Section Comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1103" target="_self">35-15-1103</a></cite>.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is intended to have the widest possible effect within constitutional limitations. Specifically, the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code applies to all trusts whenever created, to judicial proceedings concerning trusts commenced on or after its effective date, and unless the court otherwise orders, to judicial proceedings in progress on the effective date. In addition, any rules of construction or presumption provided in the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code apply to preexisting trusts unless there is a clear indication of a contrary intent in the trust’s terms. By applying the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code to preexisting trusts, the need to know two (2) bodies of law will quickly lessen.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code cannot be fully retroactive, however. Constitutional limitations preclude retroactive application of rules of construction to alter property rights under trusts that became irrevocable prior to the effective date. Also, rights already barred by a statute of limitation or rule under former law are not revived by a possibly longer statute or more liberal rule under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Nor is an act done before the effective date of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code affected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code’s enactment.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contains an additional effective date provision. Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-602ol1a" target="_self">35-15-602(a)</a></cite>, prior law will determine whether a trust executed prior to the effective date of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code is presumed to be revocable or irrevocable.
              </p>
              <p>
               Due to the various amendments to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, as well as to the Tennessee trust statutes in general that have occurred since July 1, 2004, the introductory phrase contained in subsection (a), “Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, on July 1, 2004:” should be read to mean, “Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in amendments thereto, regardless of whether such provision was adopted before, on or after July 1, 2004, on July 1, 2004:”.

               <p>
                Deeming that a settlor of a trust is the alter ego of the trustee of such trust can cause multiple significant issues, including but not limited to taxation, as well as a trust’s level of spendthrift and discretionary trust protection and the effect of exercising discretion in general. Therefore, in keeping with the Tennessee trust statutes’ emphasis on freedom of disposition and settlor’s intent, this section makes it exceedingly difficult for a settlor of a trust to be deemed an alter ego of the trustee of such trust.

                 The Uniform Trust Code has no similar provision to this section.

                <p>
                 A finding that the influence of a settlor or a beneficiary of a trust rises to the level of dominion and control over such trust can cause multiple significant issues, including but not limited to taxation, as well as a trust’s level of spendthrift and discretionary trust protection and the effect of exercising discretion in general. Therefore, in keeping with the Tennessee trust statutes’ emphasis on freedom of disposition and settlor’s intent, this section makes it exceedingly difficult to sustain that the a settlor’s or beneficiary’s influence over a trust gives either such person dominion and control over such trust.

                 General Comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Section 808 of the Uniform Trust Code nominally provides irrevocable trusts with what ULC - NCCUSL calls “powers to direct,” as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                 “(b) If the terms of a trust confer upon a person other than the settlor of a revocable trust power to direct certain actions of the trustee, the trustee shall act in accordance with an exercise of the power unless the attempted exercise is manifestly contrary to the terms of the trust or the trustee knows the attempted exercise would constitute a serious breach of a fiduciary duty that the person holding the power owes to the beneficiaries of the trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “(c) The terms of a trust may confer upon a trustee or other person a power to direct the modification or termination of the trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “(d) A person, other than a beneficiary, who holds a power to direct is presumptively a fiduciary who, as such, is required to act in good faith with regard to the purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries. The holder of a power to direct is liable for any loss that results from breach of a fiduciary duty.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Section 808 of the Uniform Trust Code is a significant step toward providing for “powers to direct.” However, it does not contain many of the provisions necessary for:
                </p>
                <p>
                 certainty regarding the rights and responsibilities of those granting or serving under such “powers to direct;”
                </p>
                <p>
                 certainly regarding the rights and responsibilities of those from whom certain traditional powers and duties of a trustee were removed through such direction; as well as
                </p>
                <p>
                 a default set of rules that assure the smooth interaction of the various parties involved in the administration of such trusts.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This part 12 (along with various other provisions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code) is designed to comprehensively cover directed trusts. Because the Uniform Trust Code does not contain provisions similar to those provided by this part 12, the effects of the provisions of this part 12 may result in significant divergence from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this part 12, as well as other portions of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code designed to facilitate or implement this part 12, are in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or controlling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A true directed trust is a trust in which the trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trust's execution. That trustee is referred to as a directed trustee. Examples of other trust participants (those directing the trustee) include an investment committee, a distribution committee, trust advisors, trust protectors and in-vestment advisors. Relative to any duty traditionally held by a party, but directed to another under the terms of a directed trust, that person no longer holding the duty is called an excluded fiduciary. A directed trustee's role is often limited to: following distribution and investment instructions, holding legal title to the trust assets, providing fiduciary and tax accounting, coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among those participants. That directed trustee is otherwise an excluded fiduciary. Typically, these duties and those of the other participants in the trust are defined and governed by the trust document itself (however, under part 12 of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such respective powers and duties can be added after the fact by agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or by a court order).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Directed trusts are also referred to by several other names:
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Reserved powers trusts” – Reserved, because someone, typically a settlor reserves to himself or to others, certain powers normally held by a trustee. Although this term is used in the United States, one is more likely to encounter it relative to trusts under the laws of Commonwealth jurisdictions, or that were written by Commonwealth attorneys.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Multi-participant trusts” – Perhaps this name best functionally describes a true directed trust. As stated above, such types of trusts operate in a system under which multiple parties hold the diverse powers and duties traditionally vested in a unitary trustee.
                </p>
                <p>

                 Why would someone want to use a directed (multi-participant) trust? Such trusts are beneficial in a number of situations, including but not limited to the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                 High net-worth families’ diverse and complex needs often make a directed (multi-participant) trust the optimum structure with which to effect multi-generational wealth planning.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Directed trusts are also often the optimum (and in many cases, mandatory) multi-generational wealth planning structure for international and cross-border families.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Perhaps one of the most succinct explanations of the factors contributing to an increase in the use of directed (multi-participant) trusts is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                 “There has been a proliferation of trusts with new participants that are required to act under a trust in addition to or in place of the traditional, plenipotent trustee. These can include co-trustees, directed trustees, trust advisors for investment and other functions, trust protectors, distribution advisors and committees, removers and appointers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The primary developments contributing to this trend are dramatic recent changes in trust law, distrust of traditional trustees, a desire to relieve trustees of liability, growing sophistication and complexity in the investment world, growing assertiveness among settlors and families seeking to exercise greater control over certain trust functions, growth in dynasty trusts, special purpose trusts requiring special expertise to administer, federal tax law limits on family involvement in distribution decisions and vigorous competition between several states for trust business. Multi-participant trusts are being fashioned to address each of the foregoing opportunities and challenges.” Duncan and Sarafa—Achieve the Promise  at 774.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Part 12 and related changes to other parts of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code included in the 2013 amendments thereto significantly expand the detail and clarity with which the subject of directed trusts is covered in the Tennessee trust statutes. However, such types of trusts are not new to Tennessee law or to the Tennessee trust statutes. As mentioned in the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808" target="_self">35-15-808</a></cite>, Tennessee has one of the longest histories of having statutes that expressly and fully provide for true directed trusts. Since the late 1980s, they have been specifically provided for in title 35, chapter 3. The applicable sections in such chapter read as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                 35-3-122.  Liability of fiduciaries for losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Whenever an instrument under which a fiduciary is acting reserves to the settlor or vests an advisory or in-vestment committee or in any other person or persons including one (1) or more other fiduciaries, to the exclusion of the fiduciary or to the exclusion of one (1) or more of several fiduciaries, authority to direct the making or retention of any investment, or to perform any other act in the management or administration of the fiduciary account, the excluded fiduciary or fiduciaries shall not be liable, either individually or as a fiduciary, for any loss resulting from the making or retention of any investment or other act pursuant to that direction.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In fact, Tennessee has one of the longest histories of statutorily providing for directed trusts. To give one an idea of how long, compare those original Tennessee directed trust statute what is believed to be one of the longest (if not the longest) existing directed trust statutes. It is Del. Code. Ann. Tit 12, § 3313. The original version of such Delaware legislation was enacted in Section 9 of 65 Del. Laws and was signed by its governor on July 3, 1986. Therefore, Tennessee’s original statute at T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-122" target="_self">35-3-122</a></cite> trails Delaware’s statute by roughly one year, making it one of the oldest directed trust statutes in the United States (and perhaps the second oldest).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Part 12 generally supersedes T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-123" target="_self">35-3-123</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c03s35-3-124" target="_self">35-3-124</a></cite>. Nevertheless, the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code recognize there are likely a number of trusts in existence that rely on such sections. This is especially true in light the fact that, by the time part 12 was adopted, such sections had been part of the Tennessee trust statutes for 24 – 26 years. Therefore, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-811" target="_self">35-15-811</a></cite> contains appropriate transition provisions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The 2013 amendments related to directed (multi-participant) trusts seek to provide those settlors who choose that their trusts be governed by Tennessee trust law, a comprehensive framework designed to achieve the promise of this powerful tool. Moreover, because such directed (multi-participant) trust provisions can be added by the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or by a court order, such settlor’s families, beneficiaries, charities and purposes can also enjoy the benefits of such tool, even if not originally provided for in the trust instrument.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Although part 12 contains the core provisions of the Tennessee trust statutes that apply to directed (multi-participant) trusts, other parts of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code contain provisions to integrate such trusts into such code and provide for their smooth operation. Some of these other provisions include, but are not limited to:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A duty among trust advisors, trust protectors and trustees to communicate with each other and keep each other informed. Under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>, a trust advisor or trust protector generally has a duty to keep each excluded fiduciary, all as such are defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, reasonably informed about the information reasonably necessary for such fiduciaries to carry out their respective duties. Moreover, A trust advisor or trust protector must inform the excluded fiduciary about any material facts that the excluded fiduciary must disclose to the beneficiaries as required by other portions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-813" target="_self">35-15-813</a></cite>. Notwithstanding the above, a trust advisor’s or trust protector’s failure to keep the excluded fiduciary informed does not affect an excluded fiduciary’s limitation of liability. Perhaps more significantly, a trust advisor’s or trust protector’s performance of its duty to keep the excluded fiduciary informed also does not affect an excluded fiduciary’s limitation of liability. This provides certainty relative to the respective potential liabilities held by a given trustee, or by a trust advisor or trust protector.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The general right of a trust advisor or trust protector to receive reasonable compensation. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-708" target="_self">35-15-708</a></cite> provides that trust advisors and trust protectors are subject to the same rules as are trustees regarding compensation. Therefore, as is the case with a trustee, a trust advisor or trust protector generally is entitled to receive reasonable compensation. The terms of the trust may specify the amount of the trust advisor’s or trust protector’s compensation. If the terms of the trust specify the trust advisor or trust protector’s compensation, then a court may adjust the amount of compensation. A court may also adjust the compensation if the trust advisor’s or trust protector’s duties are substantially different from those contemplated when the trust was created. Finally, a court may adjust the compensation if the compensation is unreasonably low or unreasonably high.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Similarly, a trust advisor or trust protector is entitled to the same degree as is a trustee to be reimbursed for expenses advanced for the benefit of the trust. A trust advisor or trust protector is similarly entitled to a lien against a trust for any amounts expended to protect the trust. See T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-709" target="_self">35-15-709</a></cite>.

                Section Comment.
               </p>
               <p>
                Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1201" target="_self">35-15-1201</a></cite>.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Uniform Trust Code has no similar provision to this section. The effects of the provisions of this section may result in significant divergence from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or con-trolling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
               </p>
               <p>
                While contained in the definition section of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite>, this section flushes out the definitions of the terms “trust advisor” and “trust protector.” Historically (and in the statutes of foreign jurisdictions), there has sometimes been a division in the powers that could be held by an “advisor” versus a “protector.” However under the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code these terms are synonymous. Therefore, regardless of the term used, either a trust advisor or trust protector can hold any power provided in this section.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (a) states that any person can be either a trust advisor or trust protector. In section 35-15-103, “person” is defined to mean “an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, public corporation, or any other legal or commercial entity.” Therefore it is completely permissible for a trust advisor or trust protector to be an entity, and in some cases using a limited liability entity as such could be beneficial. Also other than in special cases (such as with a Tennessee Investment Services Trust) there is no requirement that a trustee of a Tennessee trust be a resident of or have a place of business in Tennessee. The same is true relative to a trust advisor or trust protector under Tennessee Uniform Trust Code. Notwithstanding the preceding portions of this paragraph, a reader should be mindful that:
               </p>
               <p>
                adverse federal income and transfer tax consequences can be triggered by certain persons (including trust advisors or trust protectors) holding certain types of powers over a trust; and
               </p>
               <p>
                although the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code goes to great length to bring certainty to what state’s laws control validity and construction of, as well the principal place of administration of, a trust; the location of trust advisors or trust protectors may in some circumstances cause another jurisdiction to bring a competing claim regarding such issues; or give another jurisdiction a possible claim that it has “interests” in the trust, particularly regarding rights of creditors and the assertion that such other jurisdiction has the ability to assess its income tax on the trust. For a discussion of some of these issues, see Sections I .E and II in Duncan and Sarafa—Achieve the Promise .
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, note that the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code does not take a position on whether naming an entity as a trust advisor or trust protector (particularly if serving in a fiduciary capacity) submits such entity to regulation by the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions or similar regulator in another jurisdiction.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (a) also clearly states that a trust advisor or trust protector can be comprised of a committee. Indeed, committees are often used for this purpose by larger and more complex trusts, particularly by long lived, or “dynasty” trusts (e.g., investment committee, distribution committee, etc.).
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (a) then goes on to provide an extensive list of 21 powers that a trust advisor or trust protector may hold. While to the knowledge of the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, such is the most extensive list of powers contained in any U.S. directed trust statute, it is exceedingly important to understand that such list is in no way exclusive. Virtually any power related to a trust can be removed from a trustee and placed in the control of one or more trust advisors or trust protectors.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is also important to note that, unless the effect of the nature of granting a trust advisor or trust protector a power is such that it violates T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite> (the “mandatory rules” of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code), the provisions of part 12 are otherwise default rules. A settlor, the qualified beneficiaries or a court has the freedom to paint on a virtually blank canvas.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (b) states that, absent a trust instrument, the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or a court order providing otherwise:
               </p>
               <p>
                “The exercise of a power by a trust advisor or a trust protector shall be exercised in the sole and absolute discretion  of the trust advisor or trust protector and shall be binding on all other persons.” [emphasis added] Note that there is no “reasonableness” standard contained in the discretionary language of subsection (b).
               </p>
               <p>
                This is in keeping with the overriding goals of the Tennessee trust statutes; the furtherance of the principles that a settlor’s intent is paramount and that one should have the broadest freedom to dispose of assets as that person sees fit. Therefore, there is no “reasonableness” standard implied under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-814" target="_self">35-15-814</a></cite> relative to the exercise of discretion over a discretionary interest (which is contra to the provisions of the Uniform Trust Code and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts) and there is no “reasonableness” standard contained in the discretionary language of subsection (b).
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (c) grants the freedom to give the power to a trust advisor or trust protector to modify a trust without being subject to the provisions of T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite> – <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-412" target="_self">35-15-412</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-414" target="_self">35-15-414</a></cite>. Notwithstanding such freedom, it would seem that in many (if not most) cases, such trust advisor or trust protector should be mindful of not causing untended consequences such as those listed in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-410" target="_self">35-15-410</a></cite>(d).
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (d) makes it clear that the power of a trust advisor or trust protector need not die with death of a grantor who vested such trust advisor or trust protector with such power.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsection (e) is a savings provision to assure that the charitable nature of a trust cannot be vitiated by the act of a trust advisor or trust protector.

                 The Uniform Trust Code has no similar provision to this section. The effects of the provisions of this section may result in significant divergence from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or con-trolling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Subsection (a) contains two default rules:
                </p>
                <p>
                 The first is that any trust advisor or trust protector other than a beneficiary is a fiduciary with respect to each power held by such trust advisor or trust protector.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The second is that in in exercising a power, or refraining therefrom, a trust advisor or trust protector must not only act in accordance with the terms and purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries (as such are defined in the terms of the trust per T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b3" target="_self">35-15-105(b)(3)</a></cite>), such trust advisor or trust protector must also act in good faith
                </p>
                <p>
                 Such default rules are likely to be the appropriate ones in most circumstances (as are the similar default rules regarding good faith found in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808ol1d" target="_self">35-15-808(d)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002" target="_self">35-15-1002</a></cite>).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nevertheless, the default rules of subsection (a) relating to the requirement that a trust advisor or trust protector must act in a fiduciary capacity and the duty of a trust advisor or trust protector to act in good faith can be overridden by the terms of a trust, an agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or a court order.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Moreover relative to a trust in general as well as the powers and duties of a trust advisor or trust protector, the default rules in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-801" target="_self">35-15-801</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-808ol1d" target="_self">35-15-808(d)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1002" target="_self">35-15-1002</a></cite>) can be overridden by the terms of a trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The reasons the above specified default rules can be overridden is that they are not required by the mandatory provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-105ol1b" target="_self">35-15-105(b)</a></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Therefore, a trust advisor or trust protector can serve as such in either a fiduciary or non-fiduciary capacity and may or may be subject to a duty of good faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On a related note, it is the opinion of the drafters of the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code that, while a trust advisor or trust protector cannot be exculpated form breach of trust committed with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries (as such interests of the beneficiaries are defined in the terms of the trust), so long as such exculpation provision was not inserted in a manner that violates T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008ol1a2" target="_self">35-15-1008(a)(2)</a></cite> or (b), a trust advisor or trust protector can be exculpated from having to act in good faith. See the section comment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1008" target="_self">35-15-1008</a></cite> for a discussion of why this is so.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Subsection (b) describes the extent to which a trust advisor or trust protector will be an excluded fiduciary. It follows the definition of “excluded fiduciary” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> and the concept that those persons who do not have a power or duty over a trust should not be liable for the actions of the other persons who do have such power or duty.

Therefore, this section states an overriding rule that excluded fiduciaries have no duty to review the actions of a trustee, a trust advisor or trust protector to which any power or duty was granted or reserved, such power or duty having been removed from such excluded fiduciary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Subsection (a) states that unless the terms of a trust, the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or a court order provides otherwise, the general rule above applies and an excluded fiduciary has no duty to:
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                 Subsection (b) states that any action of an excluded beneficiary relative to any actions of any non-excluded fiduciary shall be deemed to be nothing more than administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary to allow such excluded beneficiary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the terms of the trust, the agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or a court order. Moreover, any such administrative actions; as well as any communications made by the excluded fiduciary to a non-excluded fiduciary, or to any agent or person selected by any non-excluded fiduciary to provide services (through delegation or otherwise) to the trust; does not rise to an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the authority of any non-excluded fiduciary. Unlike under subsection (a), subsection (b) can only be overridden by provisions contained in the trust instrument to the contrary.

                  Unless provided otherwise hereinafter, any reference to “section,” “subsection” or “subdivision” means all, or such portion of, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-1205" target="_self">35-15-1205</a></cite>.

                  The Uniform Trust Code has no similar provision to this section. The effects of the provisions of this section may result in significant divergence from the Uniform Trust Code and the restatements. To the extent this section is in conflict with the Uniform Trust Code, any restatement or any other foreign law, such foreign law is not precedential or con-trolling and is rejected by the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This section follows the definition of “excluded fiduciary in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-103" target="_self">35-15-103</a></cite> and the concept that those persons who do not have a power or duty over a trust should not be liable for the actions of the other persons who do have such power or duty.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Therefore, this section states the rule that excluded fiduciaries are not liable, either individually or as a fiduciary for any loss:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  resulting from the excluded fiduciary complying with a direction of a non-excluded fiduciary regardless of whether such loss results from a non-excluded fiduciary breaching their respective fiduciary responsibilities, a non-excluded fiduciary acting beyond their respective scope of authority, or otherwise;
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  resulting from any action or action of a non-excluded fiduciary; or
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  resulting from the failure of a non-excluded fiduciary to take any action proposed by an excluded fiduciary where such action requires authorization of a non-excluded fiduciary; provided that, if the excluded fiduciary had a duty to propose such action, such excluded fiduciary timely sought but failed to obtain such authorization.
                 </p>
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

      <p>
       T.C.A. § 35 15 505 generally allows creditors of the settlor to reach assets transferred by a settlor to a trust of which he or she is a beneficiary. The Tennessee Services Investment Act of 2007 establishes an exception to this rule by authorizing the creation of self-settled trusts that are exempt from the settlor’s creditors if certain conditions are met. A growing number of states authorize the creation of these types of trusts, sometimes referred to as “domestic asset protection trusts.”

        “Claim” refers to any legal right to a payment, irrespective of the manner in which the right is acquired.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Creditor” means any person who has a claim against a Transferor.

       <p>
        “Debt” means liability on a claim.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Disposition” refers to any transfer of property. A change of Trustees is a disposition. However, a change of Trustees of an Investment Services Trust after a Qualified Disposition was previously made does not require the execution of a new Qualified Affidavit to maintain the creditor protection provided by the previous Qualified Disposition. Exercising a general power of appointment to transfer property to a trust benefitting the person exercising the power is also a disposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Investment advisor” includes persons given authority to veto or approve investment decisions or distribution decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Investment decision” means any decision affecting the ownership of or rights in investments owned by an Investment Services Trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to be eligible as an “Investment Services Trust,” the trust agreement must be irrevocable, must appoint at least one Qualified Trustee, must incorporate Tennessee law to govern the validity, construction and administration of the trust, and must contain a “spendthrift” provision prohibiting the Transferor or any beneficiary from transferring, assigning, pledging or mortgaging their interest in the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Person” includes natural persons as well as entities. Entities are allowed to establish an Investment Services Trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Property” includes all types of property, real and personal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Requiring the Transferor to execute a “Qualified Affidavit” prior to making a transfer of property to an Investment Services Trust reinforces the notion that fraudulent conveyances will not be effective to avoid creditors. The required statements for the affidavit to be qualified are set forth in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c16s35-16-103" target="_self">35-16-103</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to take advantage of the creditor protection provided by an Investment Services Trust, the Transferor must make a “Qualified Disposition” to the Trust.  In order to be a Qualified Disposition, the Transferor must execute a Qualified Affidavit prior to making a transfer to the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of “Qualified Trustee” has both identity and activity components. The Trustee must be either an individual resident of Tennessee or a bank or trust company that is authorized by federal or Tennessee law to serve as a Trustee of a Tennessee trust. The Qualified Trustee must perform at least one of these 4 activities: maintain custody of some trust property in Tennessee, maintain trust records, prepare or arrange for preparation of trust tax returns, or materially participate in the administration of the trust. The Transferor will not qualify as a Qualified Trustee and should not so serve since serving as a trustee is not one of the authorized powers that the Transferor is allowed to retain pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c16s35-16-111" target="_self">35-16-111</a></cite>. Family members of the Transferor can meet the definition of a Qualified Trustee, though that may not the best choice. As long as the trust has at least one Qualified Trustee, there is no limit on the number of non-qualified co-trustees that may serve.

      If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c16s35-16-104" target="_self">35-16-104</a></cite> allows a “Spouse” or “Former Spouse” of the Transferor to become an “exception creditor” under certain circumstances. The spouse or former spouse may only set aside dispositions made after such person married the Transferor. Funding an Investment Services Trust prior to getting married is an effective method of protecting the Transferor’s assets in the event of a subsequent divorce.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to a person who transfers such person’s assets to a trust, the term “Transferor” includes a person who appoints property to the trust by exercising a general power of appointment, as well as a Trustee who decants property from another trust pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c16s35-16-816ol127" target="_self">35-16-816(27)</a></cite> or merges another trust into an Investment Services Trust. This provision facilitates the transfer of assets from other trusts into an Investment Services Trust.

       General Comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the requirements for making a Qualified Disposition is that the Transferor must sign a Qualified Affidavit prior to making the transfer to the Investment Services Trust. The purpose of the affidavit is to make sure that the Transferor is not defrauding his or her creditors. The statute lists seven specific statements that need to be addressed in the affidavit. If there are pending or threatened court actions against the Transferor, or if the Transferor is involved in any administrative proceedings, these actions or proceedings should be identified on an attachment to the affidavit. There is no time period set forth for making the transfer to the Investment Services Trust after the affidavit is executed. Nevertheless, no transfer should be made after any of the statements in the affidavit become inaccurate.

       </p>
       <p>
        Section Comment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Terms    T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t35c15s35-15-505ol1a2" target="_self">35-15-505(a)(2)</a></cite> generally precludes an individual from transferring his or her assets to a trust as a shield against the settlor’s creditors. Investment Services Trusts are an exception to this general rule.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) specifies that creditors are generally restricted from reaching the assets held in an Investment Services Trust. With certain exceptions, no action of any kind, including enforcement of a judgment, may be brought to attach trust property. Creditors seeking to reach trust property are limited to only those actions available through the Tennessee Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. Thus, if a transfer to an Investment Services Trust is found to be a fraudulent transfer, the assets can be reached.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (b)(1) creates two separate statutes of limitations for creditors to bring claims against an Investment Services Trust or a Qualified Disposition of property to an Investment Services Trust. For claims arising before the date of a Qualified Disposition, the claim must be initiated within two years or, if later, within six months after the disposition was or could reasonably have been discovered by the creditor. If the claim arises at the same time or later than the disposition, the limitations period is two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        A person shall be deemed to have discovered the existence of a Qualified Disposition when any public record is made regarding the transfer of property to the Investment Services Trust. The statute provides a non-exclusive list of types of public records, including a deed that is recorded in the register of deeds and the filing of a financing statement under the Tennessee Uniform Commercial Code.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if a creditor fits within the applicable statute of limitation, the creditor may not bring an action with respect to property that is the subject of a Qualified Disposition unless the creditor proves by clear and convincing evidence that the Transferor’s transfer was made with intent to defraud that specific creditor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) contains a tacking rule which provides that the amount of time that trust assets are held in a predecessor trust may be added to the time the assets are considered held in the Investment Services Trust. This tacking provision could be important in cases involving dispositions that are otherwise still within the applicable limitations period but were generated by previous dispositions from another asset protection trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding other provisions of the law, there is a complete bar against actions brought by creditors against a Qualified Trustee or trust advisor. This bar extends to claims against persons who provide counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of the trust. The same limitations periods applicable for claims against trust assets apply to claims brought against the trustee or trust advisor.
       </p>
       <p>
        When multiple Qualified Dispositions are made to an Investment Services Trust, each disposition is tested on its own to see whether it is protected from creditors.  Distributions are deemed to be made from the latest Qualified Disposition to the Investment Services Trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Trustee of an Investment Services Trust automatically ceases to serve if a court declines to apply Tennessee law in determining the validity, construction, or administration of such trust, or the effect of its spendthrift clause, in a proceeding involving such Trustee. If a trustee ceases to act, any successor trustee designated in the trust will take its place. The trust may have non-Tennessee co-trustees and advisors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two classes of creditors are exempted from the provisions protecting trust assets. Child support obligations and those stemming from alimony or spousal support are outside of the statute’s protections. Importantly, the statute defines “spouse” or “former spouse” as a person to whom the Transferor was married at or before the time of the qualified distribution. Thus, dispositions in trust made before the Transferor’s marriage are protected from spousal claims by the statute. Unlike some domestic asset protection trust statutes, tort claimants are not “exception creditors” in Tennessee.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for an “exception creditor” to reach assets in an Investment Services Trust, there must be final court order that a debt is due for child support, alimony, support, or division of marital property. The court must also determine that the claimant has made reasonable efforts to collect the debt or that such attempts would be futile.
       </p>
       <p>
        Creditors may not reach assets of an Investment Services Trust for forced heirship, legitime or elective share.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If a right is acquired, extinguished, or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2013, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.

      <p>
       Even if a creditor is able to reach trust assets, a Qualified Disposition is avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy the Transferor’s debt plus costs. If part of the disposition is avoided, a Qualified Trustee has a first lien against the trust property providing the Trustee has not acted in bad faith in accepting trust property. Thus, an “innocent” Trustee is able to use trust assets to pay its costs of litigating a claim before satisfying the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       A beneficiary who received a distribution before a creditor brings a successful suit to avoid a Qualified Disposition may keep the distribution unless the beneficiary acted in bad faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Trustee of a valid asset protection trust formed under the laws of another state is changed to a Qualified Trustee, the trust is eligible to qualify as an Investment Services Trust even though the trust agreement does not incorporate Tennessee law. Prior to the change of Trustee, either the original Transferor or the predecessor Trustee should sign a Qualified Affidavit based on facts as of the date of the original disposition.

       <p>
        This section sets forth eleven additional rights that the Transferor may retain without endangering the qualification of the trust as an Investment Services Trust. The trust will not be deemed revocable (and thus lose its protective value) if the trust instrument provides that: (1) the Transferor retains a power to veto trust distributions; (2) the Transferor retains a special power of appointment over trust assets. In 2013, the power of appointment in subsection 2 was expanded from a testamentary power of appointment to a power that could also be exercised during the Transferor’s lifetime. The purpose for this change was to allow the creation of a trust that qualifies as a non-grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, yet is not a completed gift for federal gift tax purposes; (3) the Transferor receives trust income or has a right to retained trust income; (4) the Transferor retains a right to income or principal from a charitable remainder unitrust or charitable remainder annuity trust; (5) the Transferor receives annually either an annuity or unitrust interest not in excess of five percent (5%); (6) the Transferor receives trust principal through either the actions of the Qualified Trustee or advisor in his sole discretion or based on an ascertainable standard set forth in the trust instrument; (7) the Transferor retains the right to remove the Trustee and appoint a new one who is not related or subordinate to the Transferor, as such term is defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 672(c); (8) the Transferor uses real property held under a personal residence trust as a personal residence; (9) the Transferor receives trust income or principal to pay income taxes due on income of the trust through either the actions of the Qualified Trustee or advisor in his sole discretion or based on mandatory direction set forth in the trust instrument; (10) the Qualified Trustee uses trust assets to pay the Transferor’s debts outstanding at the time of the Transferor’s death including the expenses of administering the Transferor’s estate, or any estate or inheritance taxes imposed on the Transferor’s estate; or (11) the Qualified Trustee pays certain tax obligations of the Transferor or the Transferor’s estate. Thus, the Transferor can retain significant benefits and control while gaining protection from creditors for trust assets.

      <p>
       Even though the original effective date of the Tennessee Services Investment Act of 2007 was July 1, 2007, valid asset protection trusts formed under the laws of another state prior to such date can still qualify as an Investment Services Trust if the requirements of an Investment Services Trust are satisfied after July 1, 2007. The 2013 changes made to the statute of limitations in § 35 16 104 apply to judicial proceedings commenced on or after July 1, 2013. Judicial proceedings commenced prior to July 1, 2013, will be governed by the longer statute of limitations contained in the original Tennessee Services Investment Act of 2007.

       In order to relieve estates and trusts of the burden of an annuity, the chancery court, on petition of one (1) or more of the beneficiaries in remainder in the estate or trust, or any portion of the estate or trust, is empowered, when not in terms prohibited by the will or trust instrument, to decree the purchase, in behalf of the annuitant, of an annuity contract of some insurance company, or insurer, that will afford the accordant definite income, for the stated term of life, stipulated for the annuitant by the law, or provision of the will or trust.

       Should any beneficiary of a remainder interest not concur, that person's interest in the estate or trust shall not be distributed until the death of the annuitant or expiration of the term stipulated, nor charged with any part of the cost of the contract. In that event, however, the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the remainder interest concurring shall be entitled to distribution of their respective interests, upon paying the cost of an annuity contract as will be productive of an income to the annuitant proportionate to their interest in the entire remainder estate, and paying all costs of the application.

       Capacity of plaintiff guardian to maintain action on behalf of ward in federal district court is determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held. Brimhall v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 702, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 3692 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compliance with provision requiring appointment of resident co-guardian to act with nonresident guardian of incompetent ward would deprive the federal district court of jurisdiction by destroying diversity of citizenship; however, the section was not applicable and compliance was unnecessary where the ward was a nonresident and had no estate to be administered in Tennessee. Brimhall v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 702, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 3692 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).

       In the absence of a statute to the contrary, a nonresident may be appointed guardian of the estate of a resident incompetent. Brimhall v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 702, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 3692 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
      </p>

       The purpose of this statute was to require appointment of a co-guardian for resident wards so that the co-guardian would be subject to the territorial jurisdiction of Tennessee courts and could be required to respond in personam to orders of court, and it does not apply to a nonresident guardian appointed by the courts of another state to serve as guardian for a ward residing outside the state with no estate to be administered in Tennessee. Brimhall v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 702, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 3692 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).

       A nonresident administrator has the capacity to maintain a wrongful death action in federal court on behalf of specific statutory beneficiaries when a resident administrator, unlike this case, has not been appointed, but capacity, nevertheless, is not the test for diversity of citizenship, it is the citizenship of the real parties in interest that controls.

       Statute did not apply because the issue was whether a marital dissolution agreement could be construed as a revocation of a previous beneficiary designation; according to the statute's plain terms, if a beneficiary designation is made as provided in subsection (d), the beneficiary designation cannot be defeated by a contrary provision in a will or by gift or by the laws of intestate succession.
