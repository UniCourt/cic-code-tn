       The judgment had to assume, in itself, the existence of a state of facts which rendered it legal and proper to remove the clerk from office, namely, that he was clerk of the court during the year or the term for which it is alleged that he was in default, and that it was moved before the court that he produce his revenue receipts, as directed under the statute, and that he failed to produce same. From these premises, a judgment that the clerk has forfeited his office, and that he be removed therefrom, was a proper and legal conclusion. Ragsdale v. State, 32 Tenn. 416, 1852 Tenn.

       From this judgment, an appeal in the nature of a writ of error did not lie; if it did, it would have had effect to suspend the judgment of removal and continue the clerk in office, pending the appeal. The remedy was by mandamus to be restored to office, or by writ of error to cause the proceedings to be revised and reversed, if erroneous. Ragsdale v. State, 32 Tenn. 416, 1852 Tenn.

       An order of removal of the clerk, made on an early day of the term, was superseded by an order to reinstate the clerk, made on a subsequent day of the same term, whether such order of restitution was erroneous or otherwise; and the court, at a subsequent term, could not annul the reinstatement or order of restitution; but it could then make a new order of removal for the previous default.

       A depository bond given by a bank and its officers and stockholders to a clerk and master of a chancery court, “and his successors in office,” was a continuing obligation enforceable, against the sureties for loss occurring during a subsequent term of such official, so long as the bank continues to receive deposits of such official unless the sureties took steps to terminate their liability.

Upon any such exchange, such installment bond shall be cancelled. The reasonable expenses in connection with such exchange shall, at the option of the municipal or public corporation, be paid by the holder or the issuer.

        Attorney General Opinions. State tax revenue allocated to the Rainy Day Fund in the budget document should not be included in “appropriations from state tax revenues” when determining whether the Copeland Cap has been exceeded. When state officials calculate the rate of growth, they may include only appropriations from state tax revenues that are received in the fiscal year.  Appropriations from the reserve for revenue fluctuation, to the extent it includes state tax revenue from the earlier year, are not included in the Copeland Cap calculation.

         There is created a fund within the state treasury, to be known as the “victims of human trafficking fund.” The fund consists of grants, appropriations by the general assembly, and any federal funds, to the extent permitted by federal law and regulation. Moneys deposited in the fund must be invested for the benefit of the fund pursuant to § 9-4-603. Moneys in the fund must not revert to the general fund, but must remain available to be used by the department of finance and administration's office of criminal justice programs exclusively for the purpose specified in subsection (b). The commissioner of the department of finance and administration has the authority to promulgate rules in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, in order to ensure the funds are received and expended for the purposes consistent with subsection (b).

         The purpose of the victims of human trafficking fund is to provide specialized comprehensive treatment and support services to the victims of human trafficking offenses, as defined in § 39-13-314. Specialized comprehensive treatment and support services for victims of human trafficking include, but are not limited to, medical care, mental health and substance abuse care, nutritional counseling, safe housing, job training, transportation, and other basic human needs. The department of finance and administration's office of criminal justice programs shall distribute moneys in the fund in the form of grants to agencies that provide specialized comprehensive treatment and support services for the victims of human trafficking. It is the legislative intent that priority for funding be directed to the single point of contact agencies in this state recognized by the Tennessee bureau of investigation and the department of children's services.

            Attorney General Opinions. As a general matter, absent the enactment of an appropriations bill for a fiscal year, there is no authority in most circumstances for the state to spend money, whether generated by the state's own taxing powers or received from other sources such as the federal government, OAG 00-083, 2000 Tenn.

If in any given year, the total amount in an employer's employer reserve account established pursuant to § 8-36-920(e) is not sufficient to meet the actuarial liabilities for which the employer's employer reserve account was created, then the board of trustees of the Tennessee consolidated retirement system shall certify to the trustees of the trust the amount necessary to fund current benefits as determined by the actuarial valuation performed by the retirement system's actuary. Upon receipt of the certification, the trustees of the trust shall determine whether transferring all or a portion of the requested amount from the employer's stabilization reserve trust account to the applicable employer reserve account of the employer would be in the best interests of the trust beneficiaries.

                       The general assembly finds and declares that accountability in program performance is vital to effective and efficient delivery of governmental services, and to maintain public confidence and trust in government. To maximize accountability, a system of strategic planning, program performance measures, and performance audits should be implemented to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of governmental services. It is of paramount public importance that this system encourages full and candid participation by all agencies of state government. This system will generate information necessary to inform the public fully and for the general assembly to make meaningful decisions about the allocation of scarce resources in meeting vital needs.

                          The Healthy Workplace Act of 2014 does not create a new cause of action against state or local employers or against state or local employees for abusive conduct in the workplace.  It appears that when a state or local government complies with the policy-adoption requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.50.html#t50c01s50-1-503ol1b" target="_blank">50-1-503(b)</a></cite>, that entity would, under certain circumstances, acquire a specific supplement to the immunity already applicable under the Governmental Tort Liability Act (GTLA) and the Tennessee Claims Commission Act. OAG 15-01, 2015 Tenn. AG LEXIS 1 (1/6/15).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Each “employer” may adopt a policy conforming to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.50.html#t50c01s50-1-503ol1b" target="_blank">50-1-503(b)</a></cite>.  When the employer is a local governmental entity, such as a county or a municipality, the question of who has authority within that local governmental entity to adopt such a policy is a matter of local law and will depend in each case on the particular charter of the local government, its ordinances, rules, and regulations. OAG 15-01, 2015 Tenn. AG LEXIS 1 (1/6/15).
                         </p>

                          The Healthy Workplace Act extends to quasi-governmental entities. “Employer” is defined in the Act as any agency, county, metropolitan government, municipality, or other political subdivision of the state. The definition of “agency” in the Act includes all boards, offices, and other agencies of the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of government. OAG 15-01, 2015 Tenn. AG LEXIS 1 (1/6/15).

                           The jurisdictional categories in this section should not be interpreted narrowly. A liberal construction, however, is a different proposition than a construction creating a new category. The commission, therefore, does not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear contribution and idemnity claims against the state. Northland Ins. Co. v. State, 33 S.W.3d 727, 2000 Tenn.

                           When deciding whether a claim is within the proper statutory scope of the commission's jurisdiction to hear and decide claims against the state, the court will give a liberal construction in favor of jurisdiction but only so long as: (1) the particular grant of jurisdiction is ambiguous and admits of several constructions; and (2) the most favorable view in support of the petitioner's claim is not clearly contrary to the statutory language used by the legislature. Stewart v. State, 33 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 711 (Tenn. 2000).

                           Although the trial court did not expressly rule on the issue of waiver and its effect on subject matter jurisdiction, an inmate properly raised the issue on appeal because prison officials posited throughout the pendency of the action that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction; because the inmate's waiver of the action deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, the issue required the dismissal of his cause of action and, therefore, it was dispositive of the appeal.

                           Discretionary function immunity is a qualified, good faith immunity, rather than an absolute immunity. By the express provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t09c08s9-8-307ol1d" target="_self">9-8-307(d)</a></cite>, it cannot be relied upon by the state in an action before the Tennessee claims commission.

                           Where the inmate asserted that a doctor and a facility administrator were negligent with respect to his treatment for hepatitis, the record showed that none of the medical aid rendered at the private for-profit correctional facility was administered by an employee of the state, and rather, each of the individuals was an employee of an independent contractor; thus summary judgment for the state was proper as it enjoyed sovereign immunity and the proper defendant for the inmate's negligence claims would have been the private contractor or its employees.

                           Neither the college handbook or the acceptance letter to medical school was a contract between the college and the medical student because: (1) The state did not intend to be contractually bound by the contents of the handbook; and (2) If the acceptance letter was a contract, its terms had been completed long before the current action; therefore, the Tennessee claims commission's decision granting summary judgment to the state and dismissing the student's claim for damages against the college for the student's removal from a clerkship and the creation of requirements the student had to complete in order to be allowed to resume medical school classes was proper.

                            There was more than a one-year lapse between claimant's February 2016 complaint and her March 2017 letter, and another such lapse occurred between the March 2017 letter and claimant's July 2018 complaint; the record included no indication that claimant sought the written consent of the Claims Commission for her failure to take any action during the periods that the case sat dormant, and thus the action was properly dismissed.

                            Dismissal of a spouse's loss of consortium claim by the Tennessee Claims Commission was appropriate because the spouse failed to comply with the statutory notice requirement when the spouse failed to file separate notice of the claim with the Tennessee Division of Claims Administration (DCA) within one year of a motor vehicle accident. The lack of notice to the DCA was not cured by inclusion of the loss of consortium claim in the Tennessee Claims Commission complaint, which was filed within one year of the accident. Kampmeyer v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 390 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 28, 2020).

                            Because an inmate waived his cause of action by first filing a claim with the Division of Claims Administration, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of his petition for a writ of mandamus; the inmate waived any other cause of action based on the same acts or omissions that he alleged against the officials in his claim to the Division because it made no finding that the officials were acting outside their offices or employment.

         The general assembly finds and declares that it is in the best interests of the citizens of this state that local governments be fiscally responsible and utilize sound financial management principles in serving their citizens. The general assembly notes that there are certain conditions and circumstances in which local governments must have emergency technical and financial assistance if they are to better serve their citizenry or, in the case of economic distress due to natural disaster, must have the financial flexibility to stabilize their financial condition. It is the intent of this part to provide procedures whereby local governments may acquire such emergency technical and financial assistance provided and guaranteed by the state or, in the case of natural disaster, may obtain adequate financing, thus enabling such local governments to stabilize their financial condition and to meet their current operational and debt service costs.

     <p>
      It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to clarify the statutory framework governing the perfection, priority and enforcement of pledges and liens made or granted in connection with the issuance of public obligations, and to preserve the customary practices with respect to these matters that have developed in the state of Tennessee among issuers and purchasers of public obligations. This chapter provides a uniform and comprehensive statutory framework governing the perfection, priority and enforcement of pledges and liens created by certain state and local governments, governmental entities, agencies and instrumentalities in connection with their issuance of debt obligations, and specifies the extent to which the perfection, priority and enforcement of such pledges and liens are excluded from title 47, chapter 9. If any statute of this state, other than title 47, chapter 9, imposes or authorizes a pledge or lien relating to any public obligations, then that statute, any official action entered into or adopted pursuant thereto, and this chapter, to the extent not in conflict with the foregoing, shall in all respects govern the creation, perfection, priority and enforcement of such pledges and liens, and title 47, chapter 9, shall not govern such matters.
