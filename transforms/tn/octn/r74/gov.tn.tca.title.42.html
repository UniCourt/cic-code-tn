         Attorney General Opinions. Senate Bill 1062/House Bill 1114, 110th Gen. Assem. (2017) would establish state-law requirements related to the inspection, licensure, and operation of motorboats carrying passengers for hire in tourist resort counties, including boats operating on the French Broad River. Certain applications of the inspection and licensure requirements in the proposed legislation would likely be preempted by the comprehensive federal statutory and regulatory scheme governing vessels operating on the navigable waters of the United States. But the restrictions in the draft legislation on the time and manner of the operation of motorboats carrying passengers for hire would not be preempted. The proposed legislation does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Tennessee Constitution or the U.S. Constitution by treating vessels that carry passengers for hire in tourist resort counties differently than the same vessels in other counties and differently than recreational vehicles in tourist resort counties. OAG 17-45, 2017 Tenn. AG LEXIS 45 (10/9/2017).

Because an airport authority has discretion to determine the fees applicable to businesses operating on its property when it enters into contracts or other agreements with those businesses, it may impose a fuel flowage fee as part of those agreements.

       Attorney General Opinions. Because an airport authority has discretion to determine the fees applicable to businesses operating on its property when it enters into contracts or other agreements with those businesses, it may impose a fuel flowage fee as part of those agreements. An airport authority may enter into agreements that require non-profit entities to pay fuel flowage fees. OAG 18-32, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 31 (7/20/2018).

       Decision of the ALJ recommending that the decision of the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) be affirmed was supported by substantial and material evidence because the ALJ had the opportunity to observe both the employee and the subordinate as they testified and to assess their credibility, and in exercising its role as the finder of fact, the ALJ resolved the question of credibility in favor of the subordinate; the MNAA demoted the employee based on a determination that the employee abused her authority by attempting to have the subordinate conduct her job-specific testing, which she had previously failed.

        City of Chattanooga had power to acquire and hold land for a municipal airport both within and beyond its corporate boundaries and both within and without the state, and could exercise the usual powers incident to ownership thereto.

        In seeking to acquire land for a municipal airport lying outside the corporate boundaries of the municipality and partly within and partly without the state the city of Chattanooga was not proposing to act in its governmental capacity but in its corporate or proprietary capacity only, and in this capacity it could not exercise the power of eminent domain or police power generally, nor was it exempt from taxation or entitled to preferential treatment in this regard.

       It is found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared that:

        <li id="t42c06s42-6-102ol1a1">
         The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question;
