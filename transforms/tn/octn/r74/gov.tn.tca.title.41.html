        Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the commissioner of correction has the authority to require security personnel employed by the department of correction to submit to drug tests.

            As long as an overcrowding emergency existed, the governor could alter the restrictions on eligibility for early release as long as the changes did not impede the ability of the department of correction and parole board to reduce the prison population to 90 percent or less of the system's designated capacity.

      <p>
       The fact that commissioners knew nothing of the mistreatment of a particular prisoner would not excuse them, if cruelties administered as part of the discipline of the workhouse were attended with circumstances showing their failure to know and act was the result of willfullness and malice; the malice required not necessarily being express ill will towards the particular prisoner, or a conscious disregard of his welfare, but a promiscuous disregard of the interest and welfare of the inmates of the workhouse. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v.

      <p>
       The duty of the commissioners responsible for the workhouse to see that the inmates of the county workhouse are kindly and humanely treated is a ministerial one. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v.

       If the workhouse commissioners have authority to inflict corporal punishment upon the inmates of that institution, they have no power to delegate that authority to a workhouse superintendent or other person. Peters v. White, 103 Tenn. 390, 53 S.W. 726, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commissioners responsible for the workhouse are liable for injuries to workhouse convicts resulting from a system of corporal punishment practiced therein, of which they either knew or by the exercise of ordinary care could have known. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for death of a workhouse convict, prima facie proved to have been the result of corporal punishment constantly practiced in the workhouse, the commissioners must show that they exercised ordinary care to see that plaintiff's intestate was kindly and humanely treated. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v.

      <p>
       As between county commissioners and foreman and guard of county workhouse the rule of respondeat superior does not apply as to ill treatment by the foreman and the guard of workhouse prisoners. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v. City of Chattanooga, 826 S.W.2d 427, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (Tenn. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where neglect of the statutory duties of county commissioners to see that workhouse convicts are properly treated resulted in the death of a convict from mistreatment by foreman or guard, it was immaterial, so far as the commissioners' liability therefor was concerned, whether misfeasance or nonfeasance, since they owed an active duty to see that the statutory mandate was carried out, and failure to perform a positive duty is a positive wrong. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v.

       Under a contract between a city and county for assignment of city prisoners to county workhouse, providing that the prisoners shall be “guarded and taken care of in every way by the county,” a city prisoner was made a prisoner of the county workhouse, under the exclusive charge of the county. Hale v. Johnston, 140 Tenn. 182, 203 S.W. 949, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1918), overruled in part, Bowers v. Chattanooga, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Dec. 9, 1991), overruled, Bowers v.

       Evidence of the mistreatment of other prisoners, and of the conduct of the foreman and guards with respect to them, was competent to show the constant, general and notorious practice of beating prisoners to show the neglect of defendant commissioners in not ascertaining the truth.

       County jail breached its duty of care to an inmate during the incarceration of the inmate by failing to provide the inmate access to proper medical treatment during the inmate's confinement when the inmate was not given a physical within 14 days of entering the jail and the inmate complained of headaches, dizziness, and vision problems.

       Supreme Court of Tennessee reads T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41c02s41-2-150" target="_self">41-2-150</a></cite> as establishing the obligation of inmates to work, when work is available and offered to them, but it concludes that nothing in this statute contradicts the requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41c02s41-2-147" target="_self">41-2-147</a></cite> that inmates must first become eligible to participate in work programs. Ray v. Madison Cty., 536 S.W.3d 824, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 473 (Tenn. Aug. 16, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41c02s41-2-150" target="_self">41-2-150</a></cite> must be read in light of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c35s40-35-314ol1g" target="_blank">40-35-314(g)</a></cite>, which requires trial courts to order inmates serving felony split confinement sentences pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c35s40-35-306" target="_blank">40-35-306</a></cite> in the local jail to participate in work programs as part of the sentence. Again, by affording trial courts authority to order split confinement inmates to participate in work programs, this statute implicitly affords trial courts authority to prescribe the conditions of that participation. Read together, the relevant statutes recognize that the trial court's judgment remains paramount in determining when a felony split confinement inmate may participate in a work program and earn work credits.

       The sheriff has charge and custody of the jail of his county and the prisoners legally committed therein and is civilly responsible for the acts of the jailer whom he appoints as to federal as well as state prisoners.

      The jailer is liable for failing to receive and safely keep all persons delivered under the authority of the United States, to the like pains and penalties as for similar failures in the case of persons committed under authority of the state; however, the marshal or person delivering a prisoner under authority of the United States is liable to the jailer for fees and the subsistence of the prisoner while so confined, which shall be the same as provided by law for prisoners committed under authority of the state. The jailer will also collect from the marshal fifty cents (50¢) a month for each prisoner, under the resolution of the first congress, and pay the same to the county trustee forthwith, to be accounted for by the trustee as other county funds.

Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t41c08s41-8-107" target="_self">41-8-107</a></cite> that noncertified counties use seventy-five percent (75%) of their subsidy to fund correctional improvements was implicitly repealed by the legislative restructuring of the county reimbursement program in 1988 from a flat rate subsidy system to a system of reimbursement of reasonable allowable costs and is not enforceable. Requiring use of monies to fund correctional improvements runs counter to the concept of reimbursing counties for their reasonable allowable costs.”

          If any person confined in the penitentiary, in a county workhouse, a city or county jail or any other penal institution, upon any charge of or conviction of any criminal offense, by any means or method willfully inflicts any wound upon such inmate's own person for the purpose of or with the effect of rendering the inmate unfit for or incapable of performing any labor assigned, the inmate may be confined in solitary confinement or subject to such other punishment, not inconsistent with humanity, as may be deemed necessary by the warden, sheriff or commissioners for the government and control of the inmates. Inmates who are placed in solitary confinement or who are hospitalized as a result of any self-inflicted wounds shall receive no credit for the time so spent.

               Inmate's previous filing of a claim in federal court, based upon the same facts and the same theories as inmate's claim in state court, formed a sufficient basis for the dismissal of the claim before the appellate court as frivolous or malicious.

               Inmate's previous filing of a claim in federal court, based upon the same facts and the same theories as inmate's claim in state court, formed a sufficient basis for the dismissal of the claim before the appellate court as frivolous or malicious. While inmate may still have had a viable eighth amendment claim in federal court, the decision for dismissal did not affect that claim, rather, it reduced the possibility of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.

               Tennessee could not constitutionally require an inmate to pay outstanding court costs and fees before he could seek review of the revocation of his parole; the denial of review therefore was not based on an adequate state ground; and the inmate's federal habeas claim was not procedurally defaulted. Clifton v. Carpenter,  2014 FED App. 307p (6th Cir.), 775 F.3d 760, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 24455 (6th Cir. Dec. 24, 2014).

               It was unclear under what authority a $ 200 balance was imposed, but even if it was not properly assessed, the $ 49.50 from the prior divorce action was properly considered an outstanding unpaid cost; there was a letter from petitioner stating he was indigent and an affidavit from the clerk stated that he proceeded in forma pauperis in the divorce action, and thus the statute was applicable to petitioner based on the outstanding fee of $ 49.50. Hughes v. Tenn. Bd. of Prob. & Parole, 514 S.W.3d 707, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (Tenn. Mar. 23, 2017).

              <p>
               Mandate that the section only applies to claims in which an affidavit of inability to pay costs is filed with the claim by the inmate means that the current action has to be filed with an affidavit of indigency, not the prior claim from which petitioner still owes fees.

               Statute did not violate petitioner's First Amendment rights; even if he remained unable to pay the amount due, he still retained access to the administrative remedies provided by the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole, plus the State's refusal to subsidize a prisoner's exercise of his First Amendment rights did not constitute a violation of those rights.

               Limiting application of the statute to whether the clerk of the court took appropriate action would be incongruous with the Act as a whole. Hughes v. Tenn. Bd. of Prob. & Parole, 514 S.W.3d 707, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (Tenn. Mar. 23, 2017).

               While the statute certainly could have been worded more narrowly to apply only to indigent prisoners with unpaid costs from prior lawsuits that were deemed frivolous by a court, which would have more directly served the statute's purpose of reducing frivolous inmate litigation, the court fails to see an express statutory directive to do so.

               Narrowing of the statute from the general population of court litigants to only inmates is rationally related to a legitimate state interest and the statute does not deprive inmates of administrative remedies and does not permanently bar any inmate access to the courts; the State has a legitimate interest in reducing costs and in reducing the amount of meritless inmate litigation, and thus the statute is rationally related to the State's interest, the constitutional requirement of rationality is satisfied, and the statute does not offend principles of equal protection. Hughes v. Tenn. Bd. of Prob. & Parole, 514 S.W.3d 707, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (Tenn. Mar. 23, 2017).

               Petitioner had a hearing before the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole that was not contingent upon his ability to pay any filing fees and had the ability to appeal the board's decision, and his appeal was denied because his allegations of misconduct were not substantiated; under the facts of this case, petitioner was not denied due process, and as applied in this case, the statute does not violate the Due Process Clause.

The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.

        Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article 3, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, such officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within such territory of the other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.
       </li>
       <li id="t41c23s41-23-102ol3b">
        The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.

        Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify the record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of such inmate's record in determining and altering the disposition of the inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.
       </li>
       <li id="t41c23s41-23-102ol3e">
        All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which the inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.
       </li>
       <li id="t41c23s41-23-102ol3f">
        Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Such record, together with any recommendations of the hearing officials, shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (f), the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

        Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.

       <li id="t41c23s41-23-102ol4a">
        Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.
       </li>
       <li id="t41c23s41-23-102ol4b">
        An inmate who escapes from an institution in which the inmate is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Article 6. Federal Aid
      </p>
      <p>
       Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision; provided, that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 7. Entry into Force
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two (2) states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of the states upon similar action by such state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 8. Withdrawal and Termination
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one (1) year after the notices provided in the statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 9. Other Arrangements Unaffected
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 10. Construction and Severability
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

       Prior to the awarding of any contract to provide correctional services as defined in § 41-24-102(2)(F), the state shall establish objective performance criteria and cost criteria for both the state and private contractor. The performance criteria shall measure the quality of management, security and safety, personnel training, inmate programs and treatment and other topics deemed appropriate. The performance criteria and cost criteria shall be established and incorporated as requirements in any proposed request for proposal and any contract and shall be used as the basis for any comparison between the state and any contractor.

       For any contract to provide correctional services as defined in § 41-24-102(2)(F), the initial contract term shall be for a period of three (3) years in order to allow the contractor sufficient time to demonstrate its performance and to provide sufficient information to allow a comparison of the performance of the contractor to the performance of the state in providing similar services; provided, however, to allow sufficient time for completion and review of any comparative evaluation, that the initial term may exceed three (3) years by a period of up to four (4) months as necessary to make the end of the initial term coincide with the state's fiscal year. The initial contract may include an option to renew for an additional period of two (2) years, subject to this section. The comparison or comparative evaluation between the state and private contractor shall not serve as the basis for contract renewal pursuant to subsection (c), but shall serve as a consideration.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c24s41-24-105ol1c">
       After the first two (2) years of operation, but before renewing the initial contract, the performance of the contractor shall be compared to the performance of the state for similar services as set out in the contract. The contract may be renewed only if the contractor is providing essentially the same quality of services as the state at a cost of five percent (5%) lower than the state as set out in the contract, or if the contractor is providing services superior in quality to those provided by the state at essentially the same cost as set out in the contract. For the purposes of this subsection (c) and for comparison, “essentially the same” means the difference is no greater than five percent (5%). For the purpose of this section and comparison “superior” means a difference greater than five percent (5%). The methodology for determining the measurement of five percent (5%) differences shall also be set out in the request for proposal and contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c24s41-24-105ol1d">
       The quality of services provided by the contractor and by the state shall be compared by a committee designated by the speakers of the senate and the house of representatives. The committee shall determine the quality of services provided by the contractor and the state by applying the performance criteria set out in the request for proposal and contract pursuant to subsection (a) and provide a numerical score for the state and the contractor. The committee shall report its determination to the parties responsible for determining whether the contract should be renewed.

       Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a contract to provide correctional services as defined in § 41-24-102(2)(F) may be extended beyond the term specified in subsection (b) as determined necessary and appropriate by the commissioner for the purpose of evaluating the department’s operational strategy for the use of the contract facility. Any such extension may be for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months. A contract amendment accomplishing such an extension shall require the approval of the authorities listed in § 41-24-104(a)(1) and the opportunity for review and comment by the entities listed in § 41-24-104(a)(2).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where the Tennessee department of correction (TDOC) contracts with a private corporation to operate prisons, it does not violate this statute when its Uniform Disciplinary Procedures allow private contractor employees to sit on disciplinary boards, because the disciplinary board, which is comprised of private contractor employees, only makes recommendations to the TDOC commissioner's designee, a TDOC employee, and actual discipline is not imposed until the designee reviews the case and approves the board's recommendation. Thus the DOC retains the authority to punish prisoners. Mandela v. Campbell, 978 S.W.2d 531, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 583 (Tenn. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       It follows from the fact that the disciplinary board's recommendation as to punishment is merely a recommendation, that a petition for certiorari directed to the chair of the disciplinary board fails to state a cause of action against the respondent; rather, the writ should be directed to the governmental agency that is responsible for the actions of which the petitioner complains.

      The superintendent, director or warden of any correctional institution or county or municipal jail or workhouse shall provide training in universal precaution from bloodborne pathogens for all employees at risk for potential occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including, but not limited to, hepatitis B or HIV (AIDS). Voluntary vaccinations shall be provided and strongly encouraged for all employees at risk. In order to increase the awareness of the need for practicing universal precaution, the superintendent, director or warden may periodically warn all employees at risk of potential exposure that a portion of the inmate population is likely to be infected with a bloodborne pathogen.
