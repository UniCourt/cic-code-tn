       There might be valid property settlement agreements between spouses executed for limited purposes, and some of these could affect only a small portion of the total assets of the parties; however, only if the agreement purports to conclude all marital rights and to effect a full settlement thereof under all contingencies would it have the effect of waiving the right to dissent or other rights of a surviving spouse.

      <p>
       A valid property settlement agreement between spouses does not automatically constitute a waiver of all rights as a surviving spouse. In re Estate of Montesi, 682 S.W.2d 906, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 909 (Tenn. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only an agreement which purports to conclude all material rights and to effect a full settlement thereof under all contingencies has the effect of waiving the right to dissent or other rights of the surviving spouse. In re Estate of Montesi, 682 S.W.2d 906, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 909 (Tenn. 1984); Hall v. Jeffers, 767 S.W.2d 654, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 635 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A property settlement agreement which was contingent upon court approval was not a “valid” agreement until the court approved it. Oakley v. Oakley, 686 S.W.2d 85, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3151 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

       Before this section is applicable, the transfer of property must have been made fraudulently with an intent to defeat the rights of the complaining spouse. Warren v. Compton, 626 S.W.2d 12, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).

   When deciding, on remand, if a decedent's surviving spouse was entitled to the decedent's bank account, after the decedent changed the account's ownership to the decedent and the decedent's long-term companion, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.45.html#t45c02s45-2-703" target="_blank">45-2-703</a></cite> was irrelevant because the statute was outside the law of the case, which was T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c01s31-1-105" target="_self">31-1-105</a></cite>.

       A bona fide advancement of real estate to a child, whereby the husband actually and openly divests himself of the property, and the enjoyment thereof, according to the wants of the child and the condition of the husband's property and family is not necessarily a conveyance made fraudulently with intention to deprive a widow of dower.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The lack of full consideration standing alone is not sufficient evidence to infer an intention to defraud. Warren v. Compton, 626 S.W.2d 12, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The following factors should be considered in determining whether the husband intended to practice a fraud upon his wife: (1) Whether the transfer was made with or without consideration; (2) the size of the transfer in relation to the husband's total estate; (3) the time between the transfer and the husband's death; (4) relations which existed between the husband and the wife at the time of the transfer; (5) the source from which the property came; (6) whether the transfer was illusory; and (7) whether the wife was adequately provided for in the will. Finley v. Finley, 726 S.W.2d 923, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3362 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was not sufficient to carry the burden of proof to show the establishment of the bank account was made fraudulently by the decedent, with an intent to defeat the rights of the complaining spouse. Finley v. Finley, 726 S.W.2d 923, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3362 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A transfer, even if supported by either a good or a valuable consideration, may not circumvent the provisions of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c01s31-1-105" target="_self">31-1-105</a></cite>. In re Estate of Parsley, 864 S.W.2d 36, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 358 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A strained marriage relationship does not of itself establish fraudulent intent, but is one factor that a court may consider along with all of the other factors and circumstances. The strained marriage relationship would logically motivate one to attempt to deprive his or her spouse of any share in an estate in favor of a child or other loved one. In re Estate of Parsley, 864 S.W.2d 36, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 358 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the lack of consideration for husband's transfers of property to daughter while alive, the size of such transfers, the timing of the transfers and the strained marital relationship, the trial court properly ruled that the transfers were fraudulent and made for the purpose of defeating the surviving spouse's right to her elective share of the estate in violation of this section. In re Estate of Parsley, 864 S.W.2d 36, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 358 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).

       When a decedent changed the ownership of the decedent's bank account from joint with the decedent's spouse to joint with the decedent's long-term companion, the spouse was not entitled to a share of the asset on the decedent's death because no intent to deprive the spouse of a share was shown, since the time between the change in ownership and the decedent's death and the parties' less than acrimonious relationship heavily favored finding the decedent's intent was donative. Simpson v. Fowler, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 222 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Transfer of the wife's real property pursuant to a quitclaim deed was not a fraudulent conveyance; the consideration for the transfer was nonexistent or nominal, but the transfer itself was not illusory, the wife acquired the real property before her marriage to the husband and was its sole owner, the transfer was made more than two years prior to her death, and the husband was provided a life estate in the real property under the quitclaim deed and her will. In re Estate of Hillis, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 148 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 25, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 479 (Tenn. June 23, 2016).

       Other provisions for the surviving spouse, whether made by will or gift, are to be considered on the issue of fraudulent intent on the part of the donor spouse in making gifts to persons other than the surviving spouse so as to avoid her dower rights.

      <p>
       When the evidence did not show a decedent changed the beneficiary of the decedent's life insurance policies to the decedent's long-term companion to deprive the decedent's spouse of a share of these assets, it was nonetheless proper to award the spouse the proceeds of these policies because the decedent intended the policies to cover the decedent's funeral expenses, and the spouse paid those expenses.

       Where decedent died intestate as to the excess property not specifically devised in her will, her sister's children inherited a residence not provided for in the will by intestate succession. In re Estate of Milam, 181 S.W.3d 344, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Oct. 3, 2005).

       In a case arising from the distribution of settlement proceeds in which the children of the deceased argued that the settlement proceeds should be distributed in accordance with a document that they propounded was the deceased's will, since that will had not been probated, it had not legal effect. Additionally, since there was no estate opened and no will admitted to probate, the proceeds of the personal injury action passed in accordance with the laws on intestate succession. Timmins v. Lindsey, 310 S.W.3d 834, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 731 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2009), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 238 (Tenn. Mar. 15, 2010).

       Trial court did not have the authority to approve the distribution of the residue of a self-settled Supplemental Needs Trust established by the co-conservators of a disabled ward to specific charities, when the ward had not executed a will and lacked testamentary capacity, because, after the wards death, any amount remaining in the Supplemental Needs Trust after the wards death and repayment to the State of Tennessee was to be distributed to the ward's estate.

   Illegitimate children may inherit, under §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c02s31-2-105" target="_self">31-2-105</a></cite>, from and through the father where the rights of inheritance have not finally vested; therefore, the phrase “shall vest immediately upon death” in this section is not the final vesting. To hold otherwise would be to bar illegitimate children from establishing paternity after the death of the father. McCluskey v. Weaver, 667 S.W.2d 747, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 458 (Tenn. Ct.

      <p>
       A child born out of wedlock, whose paternity was not adjudicated prior to the death of the father, can establish the right to inherit by intestate succession by asserting that right against the estate of the deceased owner of the property in which an interest is claimed within the time allowed for creditors to file claims against the estate, and by establishing paternity by clear and convincing proof.

      <p>
       Trial court properly ruled that a child was an heir-at-law of the decedent, who died intestate, because the inclusion of the decedent's name on the child's birth certificate evinced the execution of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that constituted a legal finding of paternity; therefore, the child's portion of the estate vested in him immediately upon the decedent's death.

       The 2016 amendment facilitates the intentions and the expectations of the parties to the will at the time of its execution; the intestate heir had no vested right in a law that would allow him to take advantage of a procedural defect, and it was well within the province of the legislature to cure the defect to prevent the heir, and others similarly situated, from gaining an unfair advantage based on a mere technicality, and such laws can be applied retrospectively without running afoul of the Tennessee Constitution. In re Estate of Stewart, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 701 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 20, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Clearly, the 2016 amendment to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.32.html#t32c02s32-2-104" target="_blank">32-2-104</a></cite> was intended to provide relief for testators who believed they had executed a valid will prior to July 1, 2016, when the two witnesses duly executed the attestation affidavit at the same time as the will was executed by the testator, but the witnesses failed to sign the will itself; the legislature intended for the 2016 amendment to apply to all wills executed prior to July 1, 2016, notwithstanding whether the testator died before the law went into effect. In re Estate of Stewart, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 701 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 20, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the testator had a will, at her death, under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c02s31-2-103" target="_self">31-2-103</a></cite>, the personal property vested in the executor, and the real property vested in the devisees, not in the intestate heir; he did not have a reasonable expectation that he would inherit, but he did have a reasonable expectation that he would have standing to contest the will, and because the retrospective application of the 2016 amendment to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.32.html#t32c01s32-1-104ol1b" target="_blank">32-1-104(b)</a></cite> did not impair any of the heir's vested rights, it could be applied retrospectively, which rendered the 2015 will valid. In re Estate of Stewart, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 701 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 20, 2017).

       The legal meaning of the word “heirs” is the class of persons upon whom descent is cast by the statute of descent. Fisher v. Malmo, 650 S.W.2d 43, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 556 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).

       The “issue of the decedent” are, unless otherwise limited, all the direct, lineal descendants of the deceased. Carter v. Hutchison, 707 S.W.2d 533, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3444 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “issue of the decedent” differs from the more common reference to “heirs at law,” “heirs,” or “heirs of the body.” Carter v. Hutchison, 707 S.W.2d 533, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3444 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).

       A child born out of wedlock may inherit from and through its father. Decker v. Meriwether, 708 S.W.2d 390, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3162 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child born out of wedlock may inherit from and through its father where paternity is established by clear and convincing proof and where rights of inheritance have not finally vested. Woods v. Fields, 798 S.W.2d 239, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 216 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990), rehearing denied, 798 S.W.2d 239, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 285 (Tenn. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff established paternity by clear and convincing evidence when it was shown that parents of putative father had acknowledged in application filed with Social Security Administration that plaintiff was child of putative father. Woods v. Fields, 798 S.W.2d 239, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 216 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990), rehearing denied, 798 S.W.2d 239, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 285 (Tenn. App. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly ruled that a child was an heir-at-law of the decedent, who died intestate, because the inclusion of the decedent's name on the child's birth certificate evinced the execution of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that constituted a legal finding of paternity; therefore, the child's portion of the estate vested in him immediately upon the decedent's death. In re Estate of Davis, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 235 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2016).

   The general assembly, by enacting T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c01s31-1-106" target="_self">31-1-106</a></cite>, did not intend to prevent certain of the victim's descendants from receiving a portion of the estate when these descendants are also the children of the person who killed the deceased.

       Where decedent died intestate as to the excess property not specifically devised in her will, her sister's children inherited a residence not provided for in the will by intestate succession. In re Estate of Milam, 181 S.W.3d 344, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Oct. 3, 2005).

       In a case arising from the distribution of settlement proceeds in which the children of the deceased argued that the settlement proceeds should be distributed in accordance with a document that they propounded was the deceased's will, since that will had not been probated, it had not legal effect. Additionally, since there was no estate opened and no will admitted to probate, the proceeds of the personal injury action passed in accordance with the laws on intestate succession. Timmins v. Lindsey, 310 S.W.3d 834, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 731 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2009), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 238 (Tenn. Mar. 15, 2010).

      <p>
       When a father established a testamentary trust in his will for the benefit of his son, and the son died thereafter, a trial court erred in ordering a trustee to distribute the corpus of the trust to the father's brother because the father intended that once he survived him and the trust was created, then the son, or the son's beneficiaries, which included the son's estranged wife, would receive the full benefit of the trust, even if the son did not live to the requisite age; the language of the will created a trust for the benefit of the son without providing a mechanism for divesting the son of the trust, once it had been created. First Tenn. Bank, N.A. v. Woodward, 362 S.W.3d 86, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 575 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 25, 2011), appeal denied, First Tenn. Bank N.A. v. Woodward, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (Tenn.

       Trial court did not have the authority to approve the distribution of the residue of a self-settled Supplemental Needs Trust established by the co-conservators of a disabled ward to specific charities, when the ward had not executed a will and lacked testamentary capacity, because, after the wards death, any amount remaining in the Supplemental Needs Trust after the wards death and repayment to the State of Tennessee was to be distributed to the ward's estate. In re Wade, 484 S.W.3d 151, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 634 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 1073 (Tenn. Dec. 14, 2015).

       Decedent's grandmother had standing to file a wrongful death action on his behalf against the county because she was authorized to do so by statute and there was no indication that the decedent had other beneficiaries who held a superior right to bring the action and objected to the grandmother doing so Haynes v. Wayne Cnty., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 249 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 19, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by reviving a decedent's prior will because it distributed the decedent's property in a manner that was generally consistent with the wishes he expressed close to the time of his death, and he did not want to die intestate; decedent made it clear to his granddaughter that he wanted to have a will, and his desires were never consistent with an intestate distribution; if the decedent died intestate, all of his property would be distributed equally among his children, and he ever expressed a desire consistent with that arrangement. In re Estate of McKelvey, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 276 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 17, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decedent's mother filed her petition three days following decedent's funeral and less than two weeks following his death, and no evidence showed a want of application by decedent's wife or daughter other than the fact that no petition to open the estate had yet been filed; a delay of two weeks following a death was not sufficient without other proof to show that the spouse and next-of-kin had failed to administer the estate. The mother was not a beneficiary and was nothing more than a stranger to the estate. In re Estate of Edmonds, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 272 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 30, 2019).

   Illegitimate children may inherit, under this section, from and through the father where the rights of inheritance have not finally vested; therefore, the phrase “shall vest immediately upon death” in §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c02s31-2-103" target="_self">31-2-103</a></cite> is not the final vesting. To hold otherwise would be to bar illegitimate children from establishing paternity after the death of the father. McCluskey v. Weaver, 667 S.W.2d 747, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 458 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

      <p>
       The holding in Allen v. Harvey, 568 S.W.2d 829, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 614 (Tenn. 1978), that children born out of wedlock may inherit by and through their father where paternity is established by clear and convincing proof, and where rights of inheritance have not finally vested, was not limited to prospective application, but was to be applied retroactively. Marshall v. Marshall, 670 S.W.2d 213, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 750 (Tenn. 1984).

       A child born out of wedlock may inherit from and through its father. Decker v. Meriwether, 708 S.W.2d 390, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3162 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant could be found to have been born out of wedlock to her putative father within the meaning of this section, even though her mother was married at the time of her conception and birth, where her mother was married to someone other than her putative father. In re Estate of Armstrong, 859 S.W.2d 323, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 161 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993), appeal denied, — S.W.2d —, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 223 (Tenn. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child born out of wedlock, whose paternity was not adjudicated prior to the death of the father, can establish the right to inherit by intestate succession by asserting that right against the estate of the deceased owner of the property in which an interest is claimed within the time allowed for creditors to file claims against the estate, and by establishing paternity by clear and convincing proof. Bilbrey v. Smithers, 937 S.W.2d 803, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 527 (Tenn. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's evidence that she was not the biological child of her mother's husband, that her mother told her that the intestate decedent was her father, and that her mother had sexual relations with decedent up to the time of his death did not offer clear and convincing proof of paternity. Walton v. Young (In re Estate of Walton), 950 S.W.2d 956, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 430 (Tenn. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate court erred in holding that a purported grandchild lacked standing to assert a claim of inheritance by intestate succession to the decedent's estate through the decedent's son because the purported grandchild qualified as a person born out of wedlock where, if the decedent's son was the purported grandchild's biological father and he and the purported grandchild's mother were not and never had been married to each other at the time of the purported grandchild's birth, even though the purported grandchild's mother was married to another man when the purported grandchild was born.

       Court of appeals erred in ordering that a father's recovery from a wrongful death action be paid toward satisfaction of his child support arrearages for his children who were unrelated to the decedent spouse because the statute was inapplicable since the father was the surviving spouse of the decedent; the term “parent” as used in subsection (b) is limited to a parent of the decedent child who owes a child support arrearage for the support of that decedent child.

       This section neither creates a presumption as to survivorship nor provides a rule of evidence; it is, instead, a rule of substantive law controlling the devolution of property of persons who die in a common disaster, and there is no sufficient evidence that they have died otherwise than simultaneously.

For purposes of this subsection (c), the decedent's gross estate shall be determined by the court in the same manner as for inheritance tax purposes pursuant to title 67, chapter 8, part 3, except that the value of any life estate or trust for the lifetime benefit of the surviving spouse shall be actuarially determined.

      <p>
       With few exceptions, the net estate includes all of decedent's real and personal property subject to disposition under the terms of the decedent's will. When a spouse dissents, the whole estate is taken into account in order that the dissenting spouse may obtain the statutory benefits as though deceased had died intestate.

      <p>
       Where husband did not disclose full extent of his estate prior to executing antenuptial agreement, the agreement was ineffective and widow was entitled to take elective share as surviving spouse. Williams v. Williams, 868 S.W.2d 616, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 609 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court erred in determining that an antenuptial agreement executed by a widow was valid and governed by Florida law, because, despite the generally applicable lex loci rule of contracts, Tennessee law applies under circumstances where the law of another jurisdiction contravenes Tennessee public policy. Enforcing the widow's antenuptial agreement violated Tennessee public policy requiring full disclosure. The court noted that under Florida law, a distinction is made as to antenuptial agreements made in a marriage dissolution versus a probate context; however, in Tennessee, no such distinction is made and full and fair disclosure is required in both contexts, as provided in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c03s36-3-501" target="_blank">36-3-501</a></cite>.

       Assuming that an elective share was determined and funded according to law, it passed from the decedent to the surviving spouse, and “an amount equal to” the full value of the elective share qualified for the marital deduction without being reduced by the amount of decedent's secured debts.

       Husband was estopped from receiving an elective share because the husband knowingly and with the advice of counsel sought and obtained his bequest of $ 100,000 pursuant to the provisions of the decedent's will against which he elected to take his elective share.

       Because a husband established that he was the surviving spouse of the decedent, he was entitled to an award of an elective-share and to receive the exempt property; equitable estoppel is not an available defense to a surviving spouse's claim for elective-share and exempt property.

       Chancery court properly granted summary judgment to a decedent's estate dismissing the surviving spouse's claim against the estate for specific property, year's support allowance, elective share, and application for homestead because the parties agreed that she did not petition the court within nine months of the decedent's passing, and the record contained no evidence by affidavit or otherwise establishing that the surviving spouse made the required application for information related to the state and condition of the estate inasmuch as her motion to compel an inventory of the estate was filed well beyond the nine-month period.

       Husband filed his petition for an elective share four months after his wife's death and never withdrew it, and while the son argued that the husband had already received benefits under the will, the son did not include citation to the record, and there was no evidence that the husband took possession of property, but instead he merely allowed it to remain where it had been for years; the husband did not assert any rights under the will or accept any benefits under it, and thus he was not estopped from claiming an elective share.

       This statute was passed by the legislature with a view to the estate owned by deceased at the moment of his death, and upon the idea that no advancements had been made by him in his lifetime.

       Declarations of the father, made after the execution of a note to him by his son, and not in the son's presence, as to whether the sum furnished was intended as an advancement, are not admissible. And where the note was taken for a sum he paid for land, the father receiving in the face of the note a lien on the land to secure its payment and the note was held until both died, the evidence outlined did not overcome the legal force of the note as a debt.

       Deed which conveyed property to grantor's wife for life with a reversion to the grantor if he should outlive her and with a provision that if she should not outlive her the property should go to a named son of the grantor and his heirs in fee simple constituted a valid conveyance to the son where the grantor predeceased the wife and not an advancement since an advancement is a perfect and irrevocable gift while the interest of the son was only contingent at the time the deed was executed.

The value of the slaves must be regarded as an advancement, and collated as such. Campbell v. Watkins, 1 Shan. 121 (1859); Hadley v. Hadley, 100 Tenn. 446, 45 S.W. 342, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1897).

Johnson v. Patterson, 81 Tenn. 626, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1884); Cazassa v. Cazassa, 92 Tenn. 573, 22 S.W. 560, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 14, 36 Am. St. Rep. 112, <cite class="lra">20 L.R.A. 178</cite> (1893).

       It is presumed that a gift by testator to legatee after execution of will was intended as ademption of legacy in will, where it set forth: “Whatever amount I do pay will be credited,” etc., and clear and convincing proof required to rebut the presumption. Gibson v. Buis, 142 Tenn. 133, 218 S.W. 220, 1919 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1919).

       Where father, as surety on his son's note, paid it and preserved the note among his other papers, in absence of proof of father's intention, this was presumed to be an advancement to son. Huffman v. Ramey, 157 Tenn. 183, 15 S.W.2d 746, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the statute creates a presumption that any transfer or conveyance of property by a parent to child is to be treated as an advancement, the burden of proof is on such child to show by competent evidence that the transfer or conveyance made by a parent to him is not to be so treated. Thornton v. Thornton, 39 Tenn. App. 225, 282 S.W.2d 361, 1955 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1955).

       Where deed from parents to daughter contained provision which would make the gift of the property an advancement to the daughter against her future inheritance from the parents, also contained provision that in the event the daughter should die without issue, the property would revert back to the parents to be redistributed to their legal heirs, the provision for reverter would be effective only if the daughter predeceased the parents, and where parents died first it would be assumed that daughter either made an accounting or the accounting was waived. Collins v. Smithson, 585 S.W.2d 598, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 483 (Tenn. 1979).

       Notes given by children to the father for property were debts, and not advancements, though the father declared that he did not intend to collect them, but that he held them as receipts to show the amounts they had received of his estate, where he reserved to himself the right, if his necessities required it, to collect them, or such parts thereof as he might need. House v. Woodard, 45 Tenn. 196, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1867).

       In a sale and conveyance of land by a father to a son, the difference between the actual value and the price paid will not be treated as an advancement merely because of inadequacy of price. Merriman v. Lacefield, 51 Tenn. 209, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 150 (1871).
      </p>

       If title is not perfected by adverse possession under a parol gift of land, it will not be an advancement, except as to rents. Yancy v. Yancy, 52 Tenn. 353, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 268, 13 Am.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the only evidence to support advancement is that a father, who had furnished the son $500, taking his note therefor and retaining a lien on the land purchased by the son with the funds, had made advancements of equal amounts to his other children, and that he had never taken steps to collect the note, the same is insufficient to support a finding that there was an advancement. Garner v. Taylor, 58 S.W. 758, 1900 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 51 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence to effect that decedent indicated through actions and conversations on and about the time of transfers that he was attempting to achieve equality among children and to effect that other children had received substantial gifts was sufficient to establish that transfers were gifts and not advancements.

       In general, where a parent takes and holds the notes or other obligations of his child for the indebtedness contracted and owing by the child to the father, they are evidences of debt; and, in the absence of proof to the contrary, they are not to be regarded as advancements. Vaden v. Hance, 38 Tenn. 300, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 178 (1858); Johnson v. Hoyle, 40 Tenn. 56, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1859); House v. Woodard, 45 Tenn. 196, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1867); Rains v.

       Donor's statement at the time of the act is competent to prove the intention to make an advancement of his son's purchase-money note to him. Jennings v. Jennings, 49 Tenn. 283, 1871 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a father conveyed to his son a tract of land for a recited consideration, and took the son's note for the difference between such and the actual value agreed upon by them, but declared that he took the note only as a sham, and that he wanted nothing more, the transaction was held to be an advancement, and the note was held as evidence of the amount of the advancement. Jennings v. Jennings, 49 Tenn. 283, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       The donor's intention must be determined from his conduct and conversation at or about the time of the gift. The agreement must depend on the circumstances at the time, and cannot be made better or worse by subsequent facts. Morris v. Morris, 56 Tenn. 814, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1872); Rains v. Hays, 2 Tenn.

       Money paid by a father as a surety for a son-in-law is not chargeable to the daughter as an advancement, nor to their child after her death. Rains v. Hays, 2 Tenn. Ch. 669 (1876), aff'd, 74 Tenn. 303, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 252, 40 Am. Rep. 39 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that a father has, for a nominal consideration, conveyed land to his son-in-law will not, without more, be sufficient to charge the daughter, or, if she be dead, her child, with the value of the land as an advancement, especially where it is not shown that the father intended the conveyance of the land as an advancement to his daughter, or that she agreed to accept it as such. Rains v. Hays, 2 Tenn. Ch. 669 (1876), aff'd, 74 Tenn. 303, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 252, 40 Am. Rep. 39 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       To constitute an advancement, there must be an intention on the part of the parent to make an advancement, and the gift by advancement must be made to his child, or to a third person, with the consent of such child. Rains v. Hays, 2 Tenn. Ch. 669 (1876), aff'd, 74 Tenn. 303, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 252, 40 Am. Rep. 39 (1880).

       To make an advancement, the intention and gift must concur. The gift alone will not suffice where the intention is clearly to the contrary. Rains v. Hays, 2 Tenn. Ch. 669 (1876), aff'd, 74 Tenn. 303, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 252, 40 Am. Rep. 39 (1880).

   The provision in a parent's deed that the property therein conveyed to his son in trust for his son's then wife, and their issue, shall not be regarded as an advancement is good. Aden v.

   In distributing the surplus of an intestate's estate, advancements should be estimated at their actual value when made, where the value was not fixed at that time, and such surplus at its value at the intestate's death. If the value was fixed at the time of the advancement, such value will control. Burton v. Dickinson, 11 Tenn. 112, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1832); House v. Woodard, 45 Tenn. 196, 1867 Tenn.

       Where advancements have been made, the net value of the estate for distribution and descent as it exists at the death of the decedent, with the value of the advancements when they were made, constitutes the fund for division, and the children (those advanced and those not advanced) are entitled to share in the subsequent increase and profits accruing to the estate in the proportion in which they were entitled to share in the corpus of the estate as it existed at the decedent's death, and after deducting their respective advancements. If a will fixes the value of the advancement, that value will prevail. Burton v. Dickinson, 11 Tenn. 112, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1832); House v. Woodard, 45 Tenn. 196, 1867 Tenn.

   If a child is placed in possession and he holds adversely for a period of seven years, the land becomes his to the extent of his inclosures. In such case, he is to be charged with the land as an advancement at its value, or the value put upon it, at the time of the parol gift and the taking of the possession under it, and not at its value when the gift was perfected by the statutes of limitations. Haynes v. Jones, 39 Tenn. 372, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 228 (1859); Keys v. Keys, 58 Tenn. 425, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 280 (1872); O'Neal v. Breecheen, 64 Tenn. 604, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 137 (1875); Jordan v.

   If a father puts his child in possession of land under a parol gift, and afterwards makes a deed of conveyance of the land to such child, the advancement must be treated as made when the possession was given under parol gift, and the child must be charged with the value at that time, and not when the deed was made.

       After the death of the parent, or after the time for division fixed by the will in cases of testacy, the same rate of interest is chargeable upon the advancements as the rate of interest or profit earned upon the corpus of the estate for division.

Richards, 30 Tenn. 429, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (1850), superseded by statute as stated in, Warren v. Compton, 626 S.W.2d 12, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981); De Vault v. De Vault, 48 S.W. 361, 1898 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 90 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the husband gives his personalty to his children, whether as an advancement or an absolute gift, for the fraudulent purpose of excluding his widow from any share therein, she is without remedy. Richards v. Richards, 30 Tenn. 429, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (1850), superseded by statute as stated in, Warren v. Compton, 626 S.W.2d 12, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).

       Unless a contrary intention appears in the will, the widow of intestate is not entitled to have advancements collated. Brown v. Dortch, 59 Tenn. 740, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1874).

       Advancements are to be collated before an attaching creditor of an heir or distributee, a purchaser from him, can have satisfaction of his debt. The interest of the heir or distributee is what is due him after charging him with all advancements, and it is this interest only that a creditor can reach and subject, or that a purchaser can hold.

       As the county court (now chancery court) has jurisdiction to partition real estate and order distribution among heirs and distributees, it would seem that this section confers upon the county court (now chancery court) jurisdiction to equalize advancements, whenever it has jurisdiction to partition real estate and order distribution among heirs and distributees.
