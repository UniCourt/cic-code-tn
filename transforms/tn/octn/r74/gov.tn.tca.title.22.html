     <p>
      It is policy of this state that all qualified citizens have an obligation to serve on petit juries or grand juries when summoned by the courts of this state, unless excused. Every person eighteen (18) years of age, being a citizen of the United States, and a resident of this state, and of the county in which the person may be summoned for jury service for a period of twelve (12) months next preceding the date of the summons, is legally qualified to act as a grand or petit juror, if not otherwise incompetent under the express provisions of this title.

       The fair-cross-section principle must have much leeway in its application. The states remain free to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemption so long as it may be fairly stated that the jury list or panels are representative of the community.

       Any person may be excused from serving as a juror if the prospective juror has a mental or physical condition that causes that person to be incapable of performing jury service. The juror, or the juror's personal representative, must provide the court with documentation from a physician licensed to practice medicine, verifying that a mental or physical condition renders the person unfit for jury service.
      </li>

       Any person, when summoned to jury duty, may be excused upon a showing that the person's service will constitute an undue or extreme physical or financial hardship to the prospective juror or a person under the prospective juror's care or supervision.

         A judge of the court for which the prospective juror was called to jury service shall make undue or extreme physical or financial hardship determinations unless a judge of that court delegates this authority to the jury coordinator.  In the event this authority is not delegated to the jury coordinator, a judge of the court may authorize the jury coordinator to make initial inquiries and recommendations concerning such requests.

        <li id="t22c01s22-1-103ol1b2">
         A person asking to be excused based on a finding of undue or extreme physical or financial hardship shall take all actions necessary to have obtained a ruling on that request by no later than the date on which the person is scheduled to appear for jury duty.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c01s22-1-103ol1b3">
         Undue or extreme physical or financial hardship does not exist solely based on the fact that a prospective juror will be required to be absent from that prospective juror's place of employment.

         A person requesting an excuse based on undue or extreme physical or financial hardship shall be required to provide the judge with income tax returns, medical statements from licensed physicians, proof of dependency or guardianship, an affidavit stating that the person is unable to obtain an appropriate substitute caregiver during the period of participation in the jury pool or on the jury, or similar documentation that the judge finds to clearly support the request to be excused. Failure to provide satisfactory documentation may result in a denial of the request to be excused.

       A person excused from jury service pursuant to this section becomes eligible for qualification as a juror following the period ordered by the court, which shall not exceed twenty-four (24) months. A person is excused from jury service permanently only when the deciding judge determines that the underlying grounds for being excused are of a permanent nature.

       Since the federal employees cannot necessarily be equated with federal office holders and since defendant failed to demonstrate the exclusion of cognizable groups, this section does not create an unrepresentative jury for the purposes of U.S. Const., amends. 6, 14.

       Capital defendant failed to establish a prima facie violation of U.S. Const. amend.

       Conviction will not be overruled on ground that one of the indicting grand jurors was a minister and therefore exempt from jury service under this section since the exemption is personal to the individual, to be claimed or waived by him alone. East v. State, 197 Tenn. 644, 277 S.W.2d 361, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 330 (1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exemptions in this section are personal to the individual, to be claimed or waived by such person alone, so that jury commission was incorrect in removing on its own initiative the names of both black and white teachers and ministers, although that technicality did not amount to the systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury list. Smith v. State, 566 S.W.2d 553, 1978 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 298 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exemptions provided by statute, such as this section, are personal, to be claimed by or waived by the prospective jurors who are entitled to them; thus, the jury commission was wrong in removing occupationally exempt persons on its own initiative. Cooper v. State, 847 S.W.2d 521, 1992 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 484 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992).

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in applying the statutory disability exemption to excuse prospective jurors from jury service to a prospective juror who had recently undergone cataract surgery. The court further did not err in excusing prospective jurors who were over the age of 65, including a 79-year-old prospective juror who had no transportation but was willing to walk to the courthouse each day. State v. Hester, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 363 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 5, 2009), aff'd, 324 S.W.3d 1, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 897 (Tenn. Oct. 5, 2010).

       The impartial jury guaranteed by constitutional provisions is one which is of impartial frame of mind at the beginning of trial, is influenced only by legal and competent evidence produced during trial, and bases its verdict upon evidence connecting defendant with the commission of the crime charged.

       Where there was a fifth degree relationship by affinity between one of the jurors and the prosecuting witness, and where the juror had no knowledge of her relationship to such witness at the time she was seated and did not learn of the relationship until after the trial was completed, no prejudice to the defendant could be shown and defendant's motion for a new trial was denied.

       Refusal to strike a prospective juror, a deputy sheriff, constituted reversible error, because: (1) The juror was a subordinate employee of a captain, whose deposition was read into evidence; (2) The nature of the case involved an assault upon a law enforcement officer; (3) The juror was personally acquainted with the officer; and (4) The juror served on the jury as its foreman while in full uniform and with sidearm.

       Where friendly relations existed between prosecutor and juror and juror was first cousin of prosecutor's wife and defendants did not learn of this relationship until after return of verdict, juror's disqualification was “disqualification propter affectum” rather than “disqualification propter defectum,” and defendants were entitled to a new trial.

       Trial court did not err by refusing to dismiss a juror for cause based upon the juror's position as a civilian employee of the police department, familiarity with the case, and the fact that the juror made financial contributions to a fund established to cover the victim's medical bills because the juror stated that neither the job nor the financial contribution to the recovery fund would prevent the juror from deciding the case on the evidence presented at trial.

       Trial court did not err in refusing to excuse a juror for cause; despite initially stating that he was inclined to believe the defendant was guilty based on what the lawyers said during voir dire, the juror stated in answer to the trial court's questions that he understood that what the lawyers said was not evidence and that he could decide the case solely on the evidence.

       Court did not err by dismissing a potential juror for cause and failing to dismiss another juror for cause because the first juror stated that she might have trouble sitting in judgment of defendant, and it was within the trial court's discretion to disqualify her from the panel. Regarding the other juror, although his answers during voir dire demonstrated that he was frustrated by the repeated burglaries of his home and that he did not believe the police were going to help him, he never said he believed people arrested for burglaries in general were probably guilty.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it removed a prospective juror who expressed his concern that his close relationship with his co-worker, whose son was on trial for murder, might affect his judgment in defendant's case and who indicated that serving as a juror would make him uncomfortable at his place of employment.

       Court did not err by failing to excuse a juror when it was discovered that her brother was formerly married to one of the witnesses for the plaintiff because the appellant failed to establish by convincing evidence that the court's action was erroneous; the juror stated she could be fair to both sides and the fact that she knew a witness would not cause her to favor one side or the other.

       The deliberate withholding of information asked for on voir dire amounted to false swearing and raised the presumption of bias and partiality, and an objection on this ground could be made after the verdict.

      <p>
       There are two broad classes of causes for challenge of a juror: (1) Propter defectum (on account of some defect) from personal objections as alienage, infancy, lack of statutory requirements, etc.; and (2) Propter affectum (on account of partiality) from some bias or partiality either actually shown to exist or presumed to exist from circumstances. Generally, objections to a juror based upon causes propter defectum cannot be made after verdict. However, objections to a juror based upon causes propter affectum may be made after verdict. Tennessee Farmers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Greer, 682 S.W.2d 920, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2923 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

       The classes of cases of necessity authorizing discharge of a jury in a criminal case are where: (1) The court is compelled by law to be adjourned before the jury can agree upon a verdict; (2) The prisoner, by his own misconduct, places it out of the power of the jury to investigate his case correctly, or is, by the visitation of providence, prevented from being able to attend his trial; or (3) There is no possibility for the jury to agree upon and return a verdict.

         Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated arson were proper because, removing from a jury venire the names of persons who had died, who no longer lived in the county, or who were physically or mentally disabled so as to prevent jury service, was legally permissible. In the absence of any evidence that the jury commissioners removed persons from the jury venire for improper purposes or that defendant was prejudiced by the removal of the persons, the service of the jury commissioners, even if they were not qualified to serve, did not provide sufficient grounds to reverse and vacate defendant's convictions.

       Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder were proper because the record did not support a conclusion that the jurors impaneled were incompetent and that he did not received his guaranteed right to trial by an impartial jury. The record failed to also reveal the allocation of the peremptory challenges; each side had 15 peremptory challenges, and only 22 peremptory challenges were exercised at the time the final jury was empaneled.

       In a capital murder case, the trial court did not err by refusing to excuse two jurors for cause because the challenged jurors either stated during voir dire that they could be impartial or were rehabilitated, and that the trial court did not err by refusing to excuse them; although one juror initially was skeptical that he could impose a sentence, he changed his position after being advised that a life sentence meant that defendant would serve at least 51 years, and although the other juror initially stated that death was the only proper sentence in a first degree murder case, he later admitted that his view was based on his lack of knowledge about the capital sentencing law.

       Court rejected defendant's argument that a juror was incompetent to serve because, of all of the prospective jurors, she was the juror whose individual voir dire was the most restricted by the trial court; the fact that defendant knew little about a juror was insufficient to establish her incompetence. State v. Schmeiderer, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 282 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 9, 2009), aff'd, 319 S.W.3d 607, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 865 (Tenn. 2010).

       Circuit court erred in denying the parents'  request for additional peremptory challenges in their wrongful death action (of a child who died during birth) against a hospital, a treating physician, and a medical practice pursuant to the state supreme court's decision in Beard v. Branson, 528 S.W.3d 487, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 540 (Tenn. 2017), upon the child's death, the wrongful death action passed to the parents, who each asserted the wrongful death claim on his or her own behalf, they constituted two “party plaintiffs,” and the trial court's failure to allow them to exercise all eight of the peremptory challenges granted to them by statute constituted prejudice to the judicial process that necessitated a new trial. O'Dneal v. Baptist Mem. Hospital-Tipton, 556 S.W.3d 759, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 63 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 6, 2018), appeal denied, O'Dneal v. Baptist Mem. Hospital-Tipton, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn.

R. Civ. P. 47.03, such error was harmless under T.R.A.P. 36(b) where there was no indication that there was any error that affected the judgment in the medical malpractice action; the matter was still tried before a panel of competent, impartial jurors after the juror was excused, and there was nothing that affected the constitutional right to a trial by jury under Tenn. Const art. I, § 6. McDonald v. Shea, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 103 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 16, 2012).

       Appellate court rejected defendants claim the trial court erred when it denied plaintiff's challenges for cause to exclude certain prospective jurors. There was nothing in the record to reflect that plaintiff's attorney exercised all of his peremptory challenges, and it was not clear whether any of the excused jurors were challenged peremptorily, much less whether they were challenged peremptorily by plaintiff.

       In a wrongful death case, although the trial court erred in granting plaintiff eight peremptory challenges, the error did not harm the administration of justice and did not result in actual harm to defendants because they did not object to the trial court's ruling on peremptory challenges and did not object to the competency of the jurors who were empaneled; like plaintiff, defendants received eight peremptory challenges, of which they exercised five.

         Upon receiving a summons to report for jury duty, any employee shall, on the next day the employee is engaged in the employee's employment, exhibit the summons to the employee's immediate superior, and the employer shall thereupon excuse the employee from employment for each day the employee's service as a juror in any court of the United States or this state exceeds three (3) hours.

         If an employee summoned for jury duty is working a night shift or is working during hours preceding those in which court is normally held, the  employee shall also be excused from employment as provided by this section for the shift immediately preceding the employee's first day of service. After the first day of service, when the person's responsibility for jury duty exceeds three (3) hours during a day, the person whose circumstances fall within the parameters of this subdivision (a)(2) shall be excused from the person's next scheduled work period occurring within twenty-four (24) hours of that day of jury service.

       It is the duty of all persons paying jurors their fee or compensation for jury service to issue to each juror a statement showing the daily fee or compensation and the total amount of fees or compensation received by the juror.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The statutory remedy of reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits was not the sole and exclusive relief available to an employee who had been discharged or discriminated against for performing jury duty, and the employee was free to pursue a common law remedy in damages. Hodges v. S. C. Toof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. 1992), rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 362 (Tenn. May 26, 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a common law right exists, and a statutory remedy is subsequently created, the statutory remedy is cumulative unless expressly stated otherwise. Hodges v. S. C. Toof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. 1992), rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 362 (Tenn. May 26, 1992).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In Tennessee, a court may henceforth award punitive damages only if it finds a defendant has acted either: (1) Intentionally; (2) Fraudulently; (3) Maliciously; or (4) Recklessly. Hodges v. S. C. Toof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. 1992), rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 362 (Tenn. May 26, 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because punitive damages are to be awarded only in the most egregious of cases, a plaintiff must prove the defendant's intentional, fraudulent, malicious, or reckless conduct by clear and convincing evidence. Hodges v. S. C. Toof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. 1992), rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 362 (Tenn. May 26, 1992).

       Employer was entitled to Fed. R. Civ.
