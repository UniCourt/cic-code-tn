        Owners and operators of a farm, who operated a pumpkin patch and corn maze and conducted concerts on their property, were protected from the application of the local zoning laws by the Tennessee Right-to-Farm Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c26s43-26-101" target="_self">43-26-101</a></cite> et seq., because their farm activities were sufficient to meet the definition of agritourism. Shore v. Maple Lane Farms, LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 229 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2012), rev'd, 411 S.W.3d 405, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. Aug. 19, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the statutory definitions of “agriculture” include recreational and educational activities, they do not include entertainment activities; therefore, entertainment activities occurring on a farm are not an agricultural use that exempts the related land, buildings, or other structures from local zoning regulation. Shore v. Maple Lane Farms, LLC, 411 S.W.3d 405, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. Aug. 19, 2013).

       <p>
        Music concerts a neighbor hosted on his farm could not claim the benefit of the exemption contained in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.13.html#t13c07s13-7-114" target="_blank">13-7-114</a></cite> from compliance with a county's zoning resolution because they did not fall within the rubric of “agriculture”; without the exemption, a homeowner's evidence established that the neighbor violated both the county zoning resolution and the order of the county board of zoning appeals limiting the concerts to one per year. Shore v. Maple Lane Farms, LLC, 411 S.W.3d 405, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. Aug. 19, 2013).

It is the intention of the general assembly that the fees shall provide funding for implementation of the respective statutes and/or improvement of the performance of the department in carrying out its duties.“(b) The fees shall be adopted by regulations by the commissioner of agriculture.“(c) All fees in existence prior to January 1, 2002, under the statutes specified in § 43-1-701(b), shall be continued and shall be calculated and maintained with any such additional fees authorized in this part; provided, that such existing fees may be used in any manner consistent with the commissioner's authority, this part notwithstanding.“(d) No permit or renewal of a permit shall be issued to an applicant for a permit under the foregoing authorities until all fees required by this part are paid in full.“(e)(1) Unless otherwise stipulated in this part, if any part of any fee imposed under this part is not paid within fifteen (15) days of the due date, a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount due shall at once accrue and be added to the amount due. Thereafter, on the first day of each month during which any part of any fee or any prior accrued penalty remains unpaid, an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the then unpaid balance shall accrue and be added to the unpaid balance. In addition, the fees not paid within fifteen (15) days after the due date shall bear interest at the maximum lawful rate from the due date to the date paid.“(2) In addition to other powers and authority provided in this part, the commissioner is authorized to seek injunctive relief in the chancery court of Davidson County or any court of competent jurisdiction for a judgment in the amount owed the state under this part.“(3) Any person required to pay the fees set forth under this part who disagrees with the calculation or applicability of the fee may petition the commissioner for a hearing. In order to perfect a hearing, a petition for a hearing, together with the total amount of the fee due must be received by the commissioner not later than fifteen (15) days after the due date. The hearing shall be in accordance with contested case provisions set forth in the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5. If it is finally determined that the amount in dispute was improperly assessed, the commissioner shall return the amount determined to be improperly assessed with interest.“(f) For the following categories, the fees shall not exceed the following maximum amounts; however, the commissioner is encouraged to use graduated fees to fairly apportion the fees:“(1) Aerial applicator licenses: two hundred dollars ($200);“(2) Aerial decals: one hundred fifty dollars ($150);“(3) Animal diagnostic laboratory services including but not limited to biopsy, necropsy, cytology, parasitology, virology, bacteriology, toxicology, and immunology: one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) per case or test;“(4) Commercial pesticide applicator certification: fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each examination, five dollars ($5.00) for each replacement card or new card issued upon completion of recertification;“(5) Florist certificate: twenty-five dollars ($25.00);“(6) License examinations: one hundred fifty dollars ($150);“(7) Nematode sample analysis: ten dollars ($10.00);“(8) Nursery stock or other plant material plant dealer certificates: two hundred dollars ($200);“(9) Pest control charter fee: two hundred dollars ($200);“(10) Pest control licenses: twenty dollars ($20.00) per category;“(11) Pesticide dealer license fee: fifty dollars ($50.00);“(12) Pesticide dealer license late fee: twenty-five dollars ($25.00);“(13) Pesticide product registration fee: one hundred dollars ($100);“(14) Pesticide product registration late fee: fifty dollars ($50.00);“(15) Phytosanitary certificates: equivalent to federal U.S. department of agriculture, animal and plant health inspection service fees;“(16) Private pesticide applicator certification: ten dollars ($10.00);“(17) Solicitor/technician cards: twenty dollars ($20.00); and“(18) Special local need (24-C) fee: two hundred fifty dollars ($250).“(g) The department shall have no authority to assess the fee imposed by subdivision (f)(8), the greenhouse plant certification fee, or any other licensure or plant certification fee established by this part against:“(1) Any person engaged in the production of tobacco seedlings; or“(2) Any farmer who produces and sells plants or seedlings in connection with such person's farming operations, but who is not primarily engaged in the business of producing and selling plants or seedlings, as determined by the commissioner.”

             The 2015 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “(a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the commissioner of finance and administration shall certify to the commissioner of agriculture the amount of fees required by each program for the subsequent fiscal year based on the general appropriations act for that year. Upon receipt of such certification, all fee schedules shall be reviewed by the commissioner of agriculture. All fees and procedures for collecting fees shall be adopted pursuant to rulemaking procedures set forth in the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5. In adopting the rules, the commissioner of agriculture shall consider detailed information regarding salary and staffing improvements and other costs to be funded by the proposed fee schedule or fee increases. The commissioner of agriculture shall not increase fees in any year general state revenues have decreased from the previous year. Pursuant to recommendations of the commissioner of agriculture, and within sixty (60) days after receiving the commissioner of finance and administration's certification of the amount of fees required by each program, the commissioner of agriculture shall submit to the commissioner of finance and administration an official estimate of fees to be collected by each program for the fiscal year. It is the intention of the general assembly that any fees authorized in this part become established by promulgation of rules and regulations within twelve (12) months of passage.“(b) The fee schedule promulgated by each of the entities listed in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c01s43-1-703" target="_self">43-1-703</a></cite> shall not, when added to their individual program fund balance for prior years, exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%).“(c)(1) Beginning in fiscal year 2003-2004 and each year thereafter, the commissioner shall prepare a report that summarizes all program expenditures and revenues associated with implementation of those statutes listed in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c01s43-1-701" target="_self">43-1-701</a></cite>. The report shall be submitted to members of the committee specified in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c01s43-1-701" target="_self">43-1-701</a></cite>(f) as well as the chair of the agriculture and natural resources committee of the house of representatives and the chair of the energy, agriculture and natural resources committee of the senate.“(2) Beginning in 2007 and at least every five (5) years thereafter, the commissioner shall evaluate fee schedules associated with the department's regulatory services and recommend adjustments as may be appropriate. The report shall be submitted to the chair of the agriculture and natural resources committee of the house of representatives and the chair of the energy, agriculture and natural resources committee of the senate.”

         <p>
          The general assembly has found and determined and does declare that the boll weevil is a public nuisance, a pest and a menace to the cotton industry. Due to the interstate nature of boll weevil infestation, it is necessary to secure the cooperation of cotton growers and other state and federal governments to carry out a program of boll weevil suppression or eradication. The purpose of this part is to secure the suppression or eradication of the boll weevil and to provide for certification of a cotton grower's organization to cooperate with state and federal agencies in the administration of cost sharing programs for the suppression or eradication of the boll weevil.

The commissioner may promulgate reasonable rules regarding areas where cotton cannot be planted within an elimination zone when there is reason to believe it will jeopardize the success of the program or present a hazard to public health or safety. The commissioner may issue rules prohibiting the planting of noncommercial cotton in elimination zones, and requiring that all growers of commercial cotton in the elimination zones participate in a program of boll weevil eradication, including cost sharing as prescribed in the rules. Notice of the prohibition and requirement shall be given by publication for one (1) day each week for three (3) successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the affected area. The commissioner may set by rule a reasonable schedule of penalty fees to be assessed when growers in designated “elimination zones” do not meet the requirements of rules issued by the commissioner with respect to reporting of acreage and participation in cost sharing as prescribed by rule. Such penalty fee shall not exceed a charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) per acre. When a grower fails to meet the requirements of rules promulgated by the commissioner, the commissioner is authorized in elimination zones to destroy cotton not in compliance with the rules. Costs incurred by the commissioner may be assessed against the grower.

           The general assembly recognizes the negative impact of uncontrolled populations of simulium jenningsi and simulium fibrinflatum (“black flies”) on the economy and quality of life of a region. The general assembly also recognizes that the tourism and agricultural industries can be particularly affected by an overpopulation of black flies and that an overpopulation may be likely to spread throughout the eastern part of the state as black fly populations increase with the improvement of water quality. The general assembly believes that it is important to explore potential solutions to black fly infestation before the black fly problem becomes unmanageable and industries important to the state suffer the consequences of state inaction.

All pesticide products shall be registered annually and their registration shall expire on June 30, following the date of issuance.

Within the discretion of the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative, a change in the labeling or formulas of a pesticide may be made within the registration term without requiring a reregistration of the product; provided, that the name of the item is not changed, and that no change is made that lowers the efficacy of the product.

In the case of products having cationic and anionic surfactants as the principal agent, the chemical names of those materials must be used in the ingredient statement on the label together with the percentage contents of the principal surfactants.

       It is the duty of the commissioner to issue and enforce a written or printed “stop sale, use, or removal” order to the owner or custodian of any lot of pesticide and to hold at a designated place when the commissioner finds the pesticide is being offered or exposed for sale in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, until the law has been complied with and the pesticide is released in writing by the commissioner or the violation has been otherwise legally disposed of by written authority; provided, that the owner or custodian of the pesticide shall have the right to appeal from such order to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county or city where the pesticides are found, praying for a judgment as to the justification of the order, and for the discharge of the pesticide from the order prohibiting the sale in accordance with the findings of the court; and provided further, that this section shall not be construed as limiting the right of the enforcement officer to proceed as authorized by other provisions of this part and part 2 of this chapter. The commissioner shall release the pesticide so withdrawn when the requirements of this part and part 2 of this chapter have been complied with and upon payment of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the withdrawal.

          “Anhydrous ammonia,” when used exclusively for commercial fertilizer, is, for the purpose of this part, defined as follows: anhydrous ammonia contains eighty-two percent (82%) nitrogen. At atmospheric pressure, ammonia is a gas that exists as a liquid below minus twenty-eight degrees Fahrenheit (-28° F.), and boils at this temperature. In commerce, ammonia is compressed to a liquid and stored under pressure. The gauge pressure is seventy-five pounds (75 lbs.) per square inch at fifty degrees Fahrenheit (50° F.), and one hundred ninety-seven pounds (197 lbs.) per square inch at one hundred degrees Fahrenheit (100° F.). The pressures exerted by anhydrous ammonia are dangerous unless the proper safety devices are installed in the equipment and care is used in handling.

         <li id="t43c11s43-11-303ol1b">
          “Dealers in anhydrous ammonia and equipment,” as covered by this part, are all persons, firms, corporations or associations who buy and sell or distribute at wholesale or retail to users and consumers, anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer, or equipment used in the installation, storage, handling, utilization and dispensing of anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer. Manufacturers of anhydrous ammonia, or manufacturers or jobbers that wholesale anhydrous ammonia equipment, when sold to dealers or distributors, as defined in this part, or any person or persons, firms or corporations owning or maintaining storage facilities for anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for their own use and accommodation, and for the use and accommodation of their tenant or sharecropper, are not to be classed as dealers within the meaning and intention of this part.

The 2014 amendment by ch. 581, in the definition of “farm operation,” deleted “and” before “the employment”, and added “marketing of farm products in conjunction with the production of farm products thereof; and any other form of agriculture as defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c01s43-1-113" target="_self">43-1-113</a></cite>;” near the end.

      The 2016 amendment substituted “and that are either grown from seed certified by a certifying agency, as defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c10s43-10-103" target="_self">43-10-103</a></cite>, or grown by an institution of higher education in this state that offers a baccalaureate or post-graduate level program of study in agricultural sciences” for “grown from seed certified by a certifying agency, as defined by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c10s43-10-103" target="_self">43-10-103</a></cite>” in the definition of “industrial hemp”.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2017 amendment rewrote the definition of “industrial hemp” which read: “ ‘Industrial hemp’ means the plants and plant parts of the genera cannabis that do not contain a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration more than three tenths of one percent (0.3%) on a dry mass basis and that are either grown from seed certified by a certifying agency, as defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c10s43-10-103" target="_self">43-10-103</a></cite>, or grown by an institution of higher education in this state that offers a baccalaureate or post-graduate level program of study in agricultural sciences.”

       Homeowner presented a prima facie case of common-law nuisance because the noise from music concerts a neighbor hosted on his farm invaded her interests in the use and enjoyment of her property, and she was forced out of her home during daytime concerts and was a hostage to the noise at night; the rebuttable presumption in the Tennessee Right to Farm Act did not apply because the concerts bore no relation to the production of cattle, corn, vegetables, strawberries, or pumpkins at the farm.

       Occurrence of some farming activity at a farm was not sufficient to shield all activities occurring at the farm from nuisance suits; the Tennessee Right to Farm Act does not extend nuisance protection to all activities occurring on a farm, but rather, the Act provides nuisance protection only to the land, buildings, and machinery used in the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock, and to certain defined activities characterized as “farm operations.” Shore v.

      Amendments. The 2014 amendment added (e) and (f).
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2016 amendment by ch. 728, in (a), deleted “, except a new type of farming operation as described in subsection (b),” following “operation” in the first sentence, and added “a” preceding  “preponderance” in the second sentence; in (a)(2), substituted “rule” and “rules” for “regulation” and “regulations”; deleted (b) through (d), which read, “(b)  With regard to the initiation of a new type of farming operation, there is a rebuttable presumption that the new type of farm operation is not a public or private nuisance, if the new type of farming operation exists for one (1) year or more on the land that is the subject of an action for nuisance before the action is initiated. The presumption created by this subsection (b) may be overcome only if the person claiming a public or private nuisance establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that either: “(1)  The new type of farm operation, based on expert testimony, does not conform to generally accepted agricultural practices; or “(2)  The new type of farm operation alleged to cause the nuisance does not comply with any applicable statute or regulation, including without limitation statutes and regulations administered by the department of agriculture or the department of environment and conservation.“(c)  As used in this section, ‘new type of farming operation’ means a farm operation that is materially different in character and nature from previous farming operations and that is initiated subsequent to the date that the person alleging nuisance became the owner or lessee of the land, the use or enjoyment of which is alleged to be affected by the farming operation; ‘new type of farming operation’ does not include the expansion or addition of facilities for a type of farming operation that existed on the land that is the subject of an action for nuisance prior to the date that the person alleging nuisance became the owner or lessee of the land, the use or enjoyment of which is alleged to be affected by the farming operation.“(d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the ability of the trier of fact to determine whether a particular farming activity is either a new type of farming operation as defined in this section, or is an expansion of or addition to an existing type of farming operation.”; and redesignated (e) and (f) as (b) and (c).
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2016 amendment  by ch. 891 rewrote (b) and (c) which read: “(b) The department of agriculture shall oversee and annually license any grower who wishes to produce industrial hemp. The department shall develop rules and regulations concerning industrial hemp production within one hundred and twenty (120) days of May 13, 2014, including rules and regulations establishing reasonable fees for licenses, permits or other necessary expenses to defray the cost of implementing and operating the industrial hemp program in this state on an ongoing basis. All revenue collected pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated for the industrial hemp program shall be used exclusively for the administration and regulation of industrial hemp.“(c) Any person who cultivates an industrial hemp crop of any size shall obtain a license from the department of agriculture. In order to obtain an industrial hemp license, the grower shall agree that the department has the right to inspect the hemp crop for compliance. If a grower fails to obtain a license, the crop will be considered marijuana under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c17s39-17-415" target="_blank">39-17-415</a></cite>.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2017 amendment added present (b)-(d); redesignated former (b) as present (e); in present (e), substituted “rules, including rules establishing reasonable fees for industrial hemp licenses, necessary to implement and administer an industrial hemp program” for “rules concerning industrial hemp production and processing, including rules establishing reasonable fees for licenses or permits to defray the cost of implementing and administering the industrial hemp program” in the first sentence, and substituted “this subsection (e) shall be used exclusively for administration” for “this subsection (b) shall be used exclusively for the administration” in the second sentence; and deleted former (c) which read: “Any person who cultivates an industrial hemp crop of any size, or who processes industrial hemp, in this state shall obtain an annual license from the department of agriculture. In order to obtain an industrial hemp license, the grower or processor shall agree that the department has the right to inspect the industrial hemp crop or inventory for compliance. If any grower or processor fails to obtain a license required by this section, any industrial hemp within the person's possession or control shall be considered marijuana under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c17s39-17-415" target="_blank">39-17-415</a></cite>.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2019 amendment deleted (b)-(e), which read: “(b)  Any person who grows or processes industrial hemp in this state must obtain an annual license from the department of agriculture. In order to obtain and maintain an industrial hemp license, the grower or processor must consent to reasonable inspection by the department of agriculture of the person's industrial hemp crop and inventory.“(c)  Viable industrial hemp in the possession or control of a person licensed by the department as a grower or processor shall not be considered marijuana under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c17s39-17-415" target="_blank">39-17-415</a></cite>. Non-viable industrial hemp or any product made from non-viable industrial hemp procured through a grower or processor licensed by the department, or otherwise procured in accordance with the department's rules, shall not be considered marijuana under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c17s39-17-415" target="_blank">39-17-415</a></cite>.“(d)  The department of agriculture shall register landrace varieties of industrial hemp for the purpose of providing notice to licensed growers and processors of which landrace varieties of hemp are industrial hemp.“(e)  The department of agriculture shall promulgate rules, including rules establishing reasonable fees for industrial hemp licenses, necessary to implement and administer an industrial hemp program in this state on an ongoing basis. All revenue collected from fees established pursuant to this subsection (e) shall be used exclusively for administration of the industrial hemp program and regulation of industrial hemp.”

       Owners and operators of a farm, who operated a pumpkin patch and corn maze and conducted concerts on their property, were protected from the application of the local zoning laws by the Tennessee Right-to-Farm Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c26s43-26-101" target="_self">43-26-101</a></cite> et seq., because their farm activities were sufficient to meet the definition of agritourism under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c39s43-39-101ol11" target="_self">43-39-101(1)</a></cite>. Additionally, a neighbor, who contended that the owners and operators were creating a nuisance, failed to rebut the presumption that the activities at the farm were not a nuisance pursuant to the Tennessee Right-to-Farm Act.

       Homeowner presented a prima facie case of common-law nuisance because the noise from music concerts a neighbor hosted on his farm invaded her interests in the use and enjoyment of her property, and she was forced out of her home during daytime concerts and was a hostage to the noise at night; the rebuttable presumption in the Tennessee Right to Farm Act did not apply because the concerts bore no relation to the production of cattle, corn, vegetables, strawberries, or pumpkins at the farm.

       Trial court erred in dismissing the easement owners' complaint in its entirety because, while they did not rebut the presumption in the Tennessee Right to Farm Act that the servient owners' farming operations was not a nuisance, they stated a claim of unreasonable interference with the use of their easement across the servient owners' farm by asserting that the servient owners impaired and substantially destroyed the easement as an access route and that the impairment was actionable in damages.

          The evidence shows that timber cutter acted in good faith rather than negligently or intentionally in violation of the owner's rights where the landowner allowed a woman to live on the land for many, many years and she had the apparent authority to contract to sell the timber to the timber cutter. Roach v. Renfro, 989 S.W.2d 335, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 422 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 668 (Tenn. Nov. 9, 1998).
         </p>
         <p>
          The important inquiry in determining whether the removal of timber was intentional is not whether the landowners intended the action, but whether they desired the consequences of the action or believed that these consequences were substantially certain to result from the action. Mix v. Miller, 27 S.W.3d 508, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 670 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where landowners relied on survey and did not remove timber until they believed they were the owners of the disputed property, the trial court properly characterized landowners' removal of timber as merely negligent rather than intentional, and awarded damages equal to double that of the current market value of the timber pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c28s43-28-312ol1a1" target="_self">43-28-312(a)(1)</a></cite>.

          Finding against a purchaser of a timber deed in regard to damages was appropriate because the purchaser did not own the land from which the timber was removed. Therefore, it was not entitled to recover double or treble damages pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43c28s43-28-312" target="_self">43-28-312</a></cite>. Remote Woodyards, LLC v.

         </h4>
         <p>
          Neither the trial court nor the appellate court may award damages based upon a measure of damages when there is no evidence in the record regarding that measure of damages. Wood v. Wolfenbarger, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 563 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 15, 2012).
         </p>
         <p>
          Because plaintiffs were not awarded the current market value of the timber that defendants'  wrongfully cut from their property, they were not entitled to an award of double the amount of their damages. Wood v. Wolfenbarger, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 563 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 15, 2012).
         </p>
         <p>
          Evidence preponderated against the finding that timber value was the correct measure of damages in plaintiffs'  action alleging that defendants wrongfully cut down trees on their property because the only witness to testify about timber value stated that timber value was an inappropriate measure of damages since there were not enough trees, and the trees were not suitable for a timber sale; the evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that the trunk formula method, the only other measure of damages for which evidence was produced at trial, was the appropriate method of valuing the damages. Wood v. Wolfenbarger, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 563 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 15, 2012).
         </p>
         <p>
          It did not appear that the trial court made any finding that the removal of the disputed timber was malicious, or done with gross negligence, and such findings would have allowed for treble damages. McEarl v. Johnson, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 635 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          It appeared the trial court's award of double damages was based upon its conclusion that in the absence of a clearly defined boundary line, the owner's action in having the timber cut was negligent, and the evidence did not preponderate against this conclusion. McEarl v. Johnson, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 635 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court did not err in awarding treble damages to a property owner because it was undisputed that the neighbor cut trees from the disputed property after receiving notice that there was a question regarding ownership of the land adjacent to his property, the preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the neighbor knowingly and intentionally cut the owner's timber, and there was nothing in the record to either refute an expert's testimony or to support the neighbor's argument as to the valuation of the owner's damages. Anderson v. Lowry, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 1002 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 342 (Tenn. May 5, 2016), cert. denied, <cite class="l_ed">196 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 217, <cite class="s_court">137 S. Ct. 303</cite>, — U.S. —, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 6231 (U.S. 2016).

Upon taking charge of any such dealer or warehouseman, the commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, ascertain by a thorough examination into its affairs, its actual financial condition, and whenever the commissioner becomes satisfied that the commodity dealer or warehouseman cannot resume business or liquidate its indebtedness to the satisfaction of its creditors, the commissioner shall report the fact of its insolvency to the attorney general and reporter, who shall immediately upon receipt of this notice institute proper proceedings in the proper court for the purpose of having a receiver appointed.

The commissioner, upon receiving this notice, shall take whatever action is necessary. The producer furnishing written notice within the prescribed length of time is entitled to the benefits of the commodity dealer's or warehouseman's bond if such bond is required in accordance with § 43-32-106. However, if a producer fails to furnish written notice to the commissioner within the prescribed time, then that producer is not entitled to any benefits under the commodity dealer's or warehouseman's bond and part 2 of this chapter. Commodity dealer liability under price later contracts, open price contracts, deferred price contracts, or similar agreements shall accrue under the bond in effect at the date of default as determined by the commissioner.

Should the defaulted amount owed producers be less than the principal amount of the bond or bonds, then the surety shall be obligated to pay only the amount of the default.

     <p>
      It is the intent and purpose of the state to encourage the conservation, protection, and responsible utilization of lands that are managed for purposes of agricultural production. It is recognized that these lands are finite, fragile, and valuable resources that contribute economically and socially to the well being of the state. It is also recognized that these lands are subject to change and conversion from agricultural production as a result of urban expansion, and similar land development measures. It is the policy of the state to provide a process for the recognition of lands dedicated to agricultural production and to assure an accurate understanding of the impacts of public policy decisions that might otherwise alter the capability of those lands to remain in agricultural production.

     <p>
      The southern dairy compact is enacted into law by the Tennessee general assembly and is entered into on behalf of the state of Tennessee, with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in a form substantially similar to the text adopted in this chapter. The compact shall become effective when enacted into law by at least two (2) other states within the compact group of states in a form substantially similar to the text as follows and when the consent of congress has been obtained. The text of the proposed compact is as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Southern Dairy Compact
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I. Statement of Purpose, Findings and Declaration of Policy
     </p>
     <p>
      § 1.  Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure continued viability of dairy farming in the south, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
     </p>
     <p>
      The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the south. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers are an integral component of the region's economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential and they are an integral part of the region's rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the federal order system be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.
     </p>
     <p>
      By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which southern diary farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for diary farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern diary industry, with all the associated benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.
     </p>
     <p>
      In today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of congress, under the compact clause of the constitution.

          An amendment to the articles does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the cooperative, a proceeding to which the cooperative is a party or the existing rights of persons other than members of the cooperative. An amendment changing a cooperative's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the cooperative in its former name.

       Because the agritourism statute provides immunity from liability, not immunity from fault, and nothing in the statute precludes the allocation of fault to a nonparty agritourism professional in a negligence action, the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to allocate fault to the nonparty farm in this case; the trial court properly prohibited the injured plaintiff from arguing that the farm was not at fault because of compliance with the statute, such that the jury was free to allocate a percentage of fault to the farm.

     <p>
      The general assembly recognizes the enormous contribution that the Tennessee forest products industry makes to the state. The continued health of the industry is vital to Tennessee's economic well-being. A fair and equitable process for awarding state incentives to the forest products industry is necessary to maintain economic viability. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a procedure that will ensure an open process for the awarding of incentives, that encourages the use of forest products but does not give an unfair advantage to one (1) segment of the forest products industry over another, and that does not put existing businesses at a competitive disadvantage.
