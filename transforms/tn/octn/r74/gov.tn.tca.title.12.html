       A member of the Underground Storage Tanks and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board is a state official.  While state officials are treated as “state employees” for some purposes, state officials are not treated as “state employees” for the purpose of procuring a public contract.  If a contractor has an employee or subcontractor who serves as a member of the Underground Storage Tanks and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board, the contractor may respond to a request for proposal or a request for qualifications to provide services under a contract with a state agency whose services are not overseen by the Board when the Board member does not have a duty “to vote for, let out, overlook, or in any manner superintend any work or any contract” in which the state agency is interested.  The contractor may not contract with a state agency if the Board member has a duty “to vote for, let out, overlook, or in any manner superintend any work or any contract” in which the state agency is interested and the Board member is “directly interested” in the contract).  The only exception is the “sole supplier” provision.  If the Board member is “directly interested” in the contract but is the sole supplier of the services in a municipality or county, the Board member is treated as being only “indirectly interested” in the contract.  In that instance, for the contract to be valid, the Board member must publically acknowledge his or her interest. OAG 18-20, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 19 (4/23/2018).

        The fact that the rule laid down by this statute may operate partially in certain instances is no argument against it and it does not matter that the services were rendered faithfully and inured to the benefit of the county or that the material furnished was necessarily and cheaply furnished.

        Good faith of mayor was not a defense where a partnership composed of himself and another hauled rock and garbage for the town for a consideration paid by the town even though there was no express agreement on the part of the town to pay for the services rendered, since there was an implied contract by the city to pay for the work.

         The statute does not require that public construction bonds shall in terms run in favor of the materialmen and laborers, only that the surety shall be in effect obligated to pay for all the materials and labor.

         Cashing by supplier of check marked “Acct. in full” did not constitute accord and satisfaction, where person with whom supplier had dealt as issuer-contractor's agent marked through the words prior to the cashing. Failure of surety on the bond to deny that timely notice of the claim was given and that suit was brought within six months after completion of the project in its answer denied it the right to rely on those defenses.

         A bondsman is required by statute to afford certain protection under certain statutory rules; but if the bondsman elects by the terms of its bond to extend that protection under less stringent rules, it may do so and is bound by the terms of its bond.

         The general rule that a county was not liable for damages resulting to third persons from the neglect of its officers, in regard to the public highways, operated to exempt the county itself from liability to anyone for the neglect of its bridge commissioners, in letting a contract for the construction of a public bridge, to take the bond required from the contractor.

         County bridge commissioners letting a contract for the construction of a public bridge, and members of a building committee contracting for the erection of a courthouse, failing to exact the statutory bond of the contractors, were not only indictable, but were also liable in a civil action for any damages resulting to laborers and furnishers of material, who would have been protected by the execution of the prescribed bond.

         Former subsection (e), concerning evaluation and review of the effectiveness and utilization of the pilot program to reimburse licensed supportive living facilities for the mentally ill, was deleted as obsolete by the code commission.

        <p>
         The intention of Acts 2011, ch. 295, § 14, effective May 27, 2011, was to create an exception to Acts 2010, ch. 1098, § 3, which purported to substitute “chief procurement officer” for “commissioner of finance and administration” in (c)(2), to become effective October 1, 2011, so that this change would not be made in this code section.

       A local government that does not own or operate an aggregate production facility, such as a quarry or other facility for the production of crushed limestone, commercial lime, agricultural lime, sand, gravel, or any other product resulting from the processing of aggregate on June 7, 2005, shall be prohibited from acquiring such facility, unless the local government prepares a financial feasibility study comparable to the one required in subsection (b) for asphalt facilities, and submits the study for review to the oversight committee established in subsection (c). The procedures for review and approval of the study shall be substantially the same as that for asphalt facilities and all other costs that are specific to an aggregate production facility. The acquisition of such facility shall also require the passage of a resolution or ordinance by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the governing body of the local government. The aggregate production facility owned or operated by a local government may transfer aggregate only to an entity of that local government; provided, that the governing body of the local government that operates the facility first conducts a study to determine the actual costs of producing the materials and requires reimbursement of actual costs to the unit of local government operating the aggregate production facility.

       This chapter provides no substantive rights or obligations but is simply a procedural statute which enables political subdivisions to combine efforts to achieve common goals. The legislature's failure to include an exculpatory clause does not imply that the legislative branch intended to impose liability on political subdivisions which join together under this chapter.
