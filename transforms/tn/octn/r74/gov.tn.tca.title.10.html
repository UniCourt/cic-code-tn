        Two (2) or more counties that have qualified for participation in the state's multi-county regional library program and that have been recognized as a region by the secretary of state and have made the minimum local appropriation of funds that may now or hereafter be required by the secretary of state, are empowered and authorized to execute contracts with each other to create a regional library board to assist the secretary of state, acting through the division of public libraries and archives, in administering and controlling the regional library services within the region. Each county shall be represented by two (2) members of the regional library board. The contract shall be authorized by a resolution of the legislative body of the county desiring to participate and the county mayor shall execute the contract as authorized in the resolution, and the contract shall be attested by the county clerk. After the governing body of a county authorizes participation, municipalities within the county may participate in the regional library service so long as the county participates. A city in a county not participating in a region can, with approval by the secretary of state, join the state regional system as related to state purchasing contracts. The secretary of state shall assess fees, from participating cities, for any additional cost of services under the state contracts. Counties and municipalities may appropriate funds for this purpose. A single county that is large enough to constitute a region and has been so recognized by the secretary of state may also create a regional library board by executing a contract between the county and one (1) or more cities within the county. There shall be at least seven (7) board members apportioned among county and municipalities according to the ratio of population in each participating municipality and in the county outside the municipalities, based on the most recent federal census.

          A public records commission is hereby created to consist of the state treasurer, the comptroller of the treasury, the secretary of state, the director of legal services for the general assembly, and the commissioner of general services as permanent members, any of whom may designate a deputy with a vote as such person's agent to represent such person, the president of the Tennessee historical society as a nonvoting member, and, when required, one (1) temporary and nonvoting member as provided in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-303" target="_self">10-7-303</a></cite>. It is the duty of the commission to determine and order proper disposition of state records. The commission shall direct the department of state to initiate, through the division of records management, by regulation or otherwise, any action it may consider necessary to accomplish more efficient control and regulation of records holdings and management in any agency. Such rules and regulations may authorize centralized microfilming for all departments, etc., or provide for other methods of reproduction for the more efficient disposition of state records. The commission shall elect its chair and shall meet not less often than twice annually. Members shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses when attending meetings, and those members who do not receive a fixed salary from the state also shall be paid a per diem of ten dollars ($10.00) for each day of actual meeting.

The county mayor shall appoint three (3) members and the county legislative body shall confirm each appointee. Of the three (3) appointees, one (1) shall be a member of the county legislative body, one (1) shall be a judge of one of the courts of record or designee of such judge which holds court in the county and one (1) shall be a genealogist. The county clerk, or the designee of the county clerk, county register, or the designee of the county register, and the county historian shall be ex officio members of the commission. In counties having a duly appointed county archivist, that person shall also serve as an ex officio member of the commission. In counties having a technology department or information technology department, the county legislative body may designate the director of such department as an ex officio member of the commission, and if so designated, the director or designee of the director shall also serve as an ex officio member of the commission. Each elected member of the commission shall hold office during the term for which the member was elected to office. If a vacancy occurs in one (1) of the appointed positions, the county mayor shall appoint a person in the same manner as the original appointment.

            To the extent a social media account created and maintained by a municipality is made “pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business,” that account and any comments posted on the account constitute public records subject to inspection under the Tennessee Public Records Act. The Act does not address whether comments posted on a municipal social media account are subject to removal or censorship.   It only provides a statutory right of inspection of public records to Tennessee citizens.  Furthermore, to the extent a municipality has any “public records” with respect to the appointment and identity of an administrator of a municipal social media account, those records are subject to inspection under the Tennessee Public Records Act. OAG 16-47, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 46 (12/22/2016).

            A records custodian of municipal public records is required to respond to a public records request.  If a records custodian denies a request for public records or otherwise fails to timely respond to the request in accordance with the statutory procedures, the Tennessee citizen making the request may bring an action pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505" target="_self">10-7-505</a></cite> in chancery or circuit court for the county in which the records are situated for judicial review of the denial of access to the requested records. A member of the public may also consult with the Office of Open Records Counsel, who has the authority to answer questions, to issue informal advisory opinions, and to informally mediate and assist with the resolution of issues concerning the open records laws.

            State law does not prohibit elected state officials from using state property, including the Executive Residence, for campaign-related activities. Tennessee’s Campaign Financial Disclosure Act would require the disclosure of expenditures incurred for such campaign-related activities on state property if they constitute either a “contribution” or an “expenditure” as defined under the Act. To the extent that the Governor’s non-personal schedule, including events at the Executive Residence, meets the definition of “public record” as set forth in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503ol1a1A" target="_self">10-7-503(a)(1)(A)</a></cite>, then it is subject to disclosure under Tennessee’s Public Records Act, unless a state law provides otherwise. OAG 16-48, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 47 (12/22/2016).
           </p>
           <p>
            If the state or local government official is the records custodian of the requested public records, then Tennessee’s Public Records Act generally requires that, if practicable, the records custodian make the public records available for inspection during normal business hours, unless a state law provides otherwise with respect to the openness of the requested records. Tennessee’s Public Records Act does not require a records custodian to provide certified copies of public records in response to an oral or written request. OAG 18-23, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 22 (5/30/2018).

             Plaintiff's claims that the citizens only requirement in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503ol1a2A" target="_self">10-7-503(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> was invalid under the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution survived a motion to dismiss because plaintiff alleged that the citizens only requirement deprived him of the ability to engage in the political process with regard to matters of national importance and had the practical effect of discriminating against interstate commerce. Jones v. City of Memphis, 852 F. Supp. 2d 1002, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17527 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 13, 2012).

            <p>
             Broadening the right of access to public records beyond the specific delineations articulated in Lee v. Minner, 458 F.3d 194, 199, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 20988 (3d Cir. 2006) would be inappropriate and not in keeping with the traditional boundaries placed upon fundamental rights recognized by Privileges and Immunities Clause jurisprudence. Accordingly, the civil right advocate's desired right to access information in order to assist minority businesses and access to public records regarding non-economic information were not fundamental rights under the Privileges and Immunities Clause; therefore, application of the citizens only requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503" target="_self">10-7-503</a></cite> could not burden his records request. Jones v. City of Memphis, 868 F. Supp. 2d 710, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51026 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 11, 2012), aff'd, 531 Fed. Appx. 709, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17145, 2013 FED App. 764N (6th Cir. Tenn. 2013).

            <p>
             Citizens only requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503" target="_self">10-7-503</a></cite> did not address business, professions, or trade, nor were they specifically directed at differentiating commercial activity on the basis of state residency. Instead, they focused on the public's access to public records, which was not commercial activity and was unrelated to the civil rights advocate's business, profession, or trade. Therefore, even if the advocate's volunteer activities could be construed as a common calling, the citizens only requirement would not unconstitutionally infringe on that common calling under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Jones v. City of Memphis, 868 F. Supp. 2d 710, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51026 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 11, 2012), aff'd, 531 Fed. Appx. 709, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17145, 2013 FED App. 764N (6th Cir. Tenn. 2013).

Jones v. City of Memphis, 868 F. Supp. 2d 710, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51026 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 11, 2012), aff'd, 531 Fed. Appx. 709, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17145, 2013 FED App. 764N (6th Cir. Tenn. 2013).

            <p>
             Winning contract bid for a State Advocacy/State Lobbying Services contract was not a matter of national political and economic importance, and the civil rights advocate had not pointed to evidence indicating that it would be. Therefore, because the advocate did not request information under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503" target="_self">10-7-503</a></cite> enabling him to participate in the political process regarding a matter of national political and economic importance, a fundamental right protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause was not burdened.

             In a Tennessee Public Records Act (TPRA) proceeding, given their ready availability, access to the May packet and the list of landfill users discussed in the May meeting was practicable, and the failure of the director and records custodian of the Solid Waste Board of Hamblen County/Morristown to make those documents available for inspection and copying when they were easily accessible in the Board's office when petitioner went to his office three consecutive days prior to the June 17 Board meeting did not fulfill the purpose or requirements of the TPRA; thus, the appellate court reversed the trial court's holding that the director made the May packet and the list of landfill users available to petitioner in a practical amount of time.

             Although the trial court properly concluded that a private company that managed a city sports arena for a metropolitan government sports authority acted as the functional equivalent of a government agency in the management of the arena, and as such was subject to the public records act, the court erred in ordering that a confidential mediated settlement agreement between the company and the cheerleaders for a sports team had to be publicly disclosed and filed with the clerk's office instead of merely providing the newspaper reporter with a copy of the document.

Henderson v. City of Chattanooga, 133 S.W.3d 192, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 699 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003).

             Where petitioners, broadcasters and publishers sought the photographs of six officers involved in the detention and resulting death of a criminal suspect, the trial testimony could be summed up as almost all officers being theoretically in a “pool” from which officers could have been taken for undercover assignment; but respondents', the city's, the officers', and police associations' interpretation and application of the exception under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-504ol1g1A" target="_self">10-7-504(g)(1)(A)</a></cite> would have meant that no police officers' photo would be required to be produced, and given the facts, the appellate court denied respondents' contentions that disclosure of the subject photographs was exempted by the undercover exception under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-504ol1g1A" target="_self">10-7-504(g)(1)(A)</a></cite>.

             Commissioner was not entitled to redact the names of the suppliers of the substances necessary to carry out the lethal injection executions and the employees who procured those substances in a Public Records Act action brought by a public defender because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-504ol1h1" target="_self">10-7-504(h)(1)</a></cite> only protected the identities of those persons who were “directly involved” in the execution, not the identities of those who supplied the lethal injection chemicals to the state or the identities of the state employees who procured the chemicals.

            To the extent a social media account created and maintained by a municipality is made “pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business,” that account and any comments posted on the account constitute public records subject to inspection under the Tennessee Public Records Act. The Act does not address whether comments posted on a municipal social media account are subject to removal or censorship. It only provides a statutory right of inspection of public records to Tennessee citizens.  Furthermore, to the extent a municipality has any “public records” with respect to the appointment and identity of an administrator of a municipal social media account, those records are subject to inspection under the Tennessee Public Records Act. OAG 16-47, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 46 (12/22/2016).
           </p>
           <p>
            A records custodian of municipal public records is required to respond to a public records request.  If a records custodian denies a request for public records or otherwise fails to timely respond to the request in accordance with the statutory procedures, the Tennessee citizen making the request may bring an action pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505" target="_self">10-7-505</a></cite> in chancery or circuit court for the county in which the records are situated for judicial review of the denial of access to the requested records. A member of the public may also consult with the Office of Open Records Counsel, who has the authority to answer questions, to issue informal advisory opinions, and to informally mediate and assist with the resolution of issues concerning the open records laws. OAG 16-47, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 46 (12/22/2016).

             This section does not limit the scope of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503" target="_self">10-7-503</a></cite>, nor does it give the courts leeway to exempt records from public inspection. Memphis Pub. Co. v. Holt, 710 S.W.2d 513, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 689 (Tenn. 1986).
            </p>
            <p>
             Documents described in Tenn. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) were not discoverable in either proceedings to which the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure applied or separate proceedings under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505" target="_self">10-7-505</a></cite> as long as the criminal conviction associated with the records being sought was being collaterally attacked; there was no logical reason to differentiate between pending state post-conviction proceedings and federal habeas corpus proceedings, such that discovery in defendant's pending federal habeas corpus proceeding should be governed by the federal rules applicable to that proceeding, and Tennessee's public records statutes should not be used to circumvent those rules. Swift v. Campbell, 159 S.W.3d 565, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 561 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Jan. 31, 2005).
            </p>
            <p>
             Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 31 does not clearly delineate an exception to the Public Records Act and an appellate court does not have the authority to create one, and therefore a confidential mediated settlement agreement is not excepted from disclosure under the Act. Allen v. Day, 213 S.W.3d 244, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 542 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 1211 (Tenn. Dec. 27, 2006).
            </p>
            <p>
             Although the trial court properly concluded that a private company that managed a city sports arena acted as the functional equivalent of a government agency in the management of the arena, and as such was subject to the public records act, the court erred in ordering that a confidential mediated settlement agreement between the company and the cheerleaders for a sports team had to be publicly disclosed and filed with the clerk's office instead of merely providing the newspaper reporter with a copy of the document. Allen v. Day, 213 S.W.3d 244, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 542 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 1211 (Tenn. Dec. 27, 2006).
            </p>
            <p>
             Newspaper reporter's request for a copy of confidential mediated settlement agreement was sufficient to meet the statutory subject matter jurisdictional requirements, because, even though she did not personally appear at the custodian's business to request a copy of the confidential mediated settlement agreement, she did not have to comply with the literal requirement of the public record act, and the company's denial of access to the agreement by its spokesperson constituted a denial by an official or designee. Allen v. Day, 213 S.W.3d 244, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 542 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 1211 (Tenn. Dec. 27, 2006).

Schneider v. City of Jackson, 226 S.W.3d 332, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 504 (Tenn. May 25, 2007).
            </p>
            <p>
             Fact that the state employee was required to file a contempt petition to enforce the trial court's order did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to the employee as she claimed, because the burden of proof relates to the official's justification of nondisclosure, and here there was no such claim made; the sheriff did not argue that the records were non-disclosable, but acknowledged that the records were public and that the employee was entitled to access. Moody v. Hutchison, 247 S.W.3d 187, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 581 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 17, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (Tenn. Mar. 3, 2008).
            </p>
            <p>
             Although the resident argued that the court clerk, deputy clerk, and judicial assistant violated T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-503" target="_self">10-7-503</a></cite> regarding records open to public inspection, the claim was dismissed as resident did not allege that his request to see the file was denied under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505" target="_self">10-7-505</a></cite>; summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the judicial assistant, because she negated an essential element of the resident's claim. Kersey v. Bratcher, 253 S.W.3d 625, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 586 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2007), rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 672 (Tenn. Ct.

             Media company was dismissed from an appeal because it was a non-citizen of Tennessee, and could not avail itself of the Tennessee Public Records Act to petition for access to public records; however, a reporter undisputedly was a citizen of Tennessee and could properly bring the action. Scripps Media., Inc. v. Tenn. Dep't of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Servs., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 398 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 16, 2019).

             Where there was question whether transcripts of depositions taken by attorney for county and city in bankruptcy proceedings were “records” under the Public Records Act, it could not be said that city and county willfully refused to disclose them, making them liable for attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to subsection (g).Memphis Publishing Co. v.

             From a doctor's suit against a public hospital regarding his staff privileges being revoked, the doctor's lawyers should not have been held in civil contempt after they sought public records from the hospital while the doctor's interlocutory appeal regarding a discovery dispute was pending because the plain language of the order staying “all proceedings below” was not broad enough to apply to separate actions under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505ol1a" target="_self">10-7-505(a)</a></cite> seeking access to public records; the appellate court's stay order could reasonably have been interpreted to apply only to the pending legal and administrative proceedings between the doctor and the hospital.

             Where the record did not support that the city knew that documents were public record and willfully refused to disclose them, the city was not responsible for attorney's fees, as the court would not impute to the city a duty to foretell an uncertain judicial future.

             Where petitioners, broadcasters and publishers sought the photographs of six officers involved in the detention and resulting death of a gang-member, the issue was whether the exception under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-504ol1g1A" target="_self">10-7-504(g)(1)(A)</a></cite> precluded disclosure of the officers' photographs as potentially dangerous to the officers or their families; and in light of the difficult and significant legal issues presented, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to award attorney fees to the successful petitioners.

             Trial court did not err in denying an award of attorney fees to a newspaper in a suit in which a company, that was the functional equivalent of a government agency, was ordered to disclose a confidential mediated settlement agreement because the trial court had not abused its discretion in having found that the company had acted reasonably and in good faith.

             Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505ol1g" target="_self">10-7-505(g)</a></cite>, the trial court had discretion to award attorney fees where it found that the sheriff had willfully refused to disclose public records; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award fees where the employee's trial counsel refused to provide the trial court with the necessary information. Moody v. Hutchison, 247 S.W.3d 187, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 581 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 17, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (Tenn. Mar. 3, 2008).

             Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying an award of attorney's fees to a citizen who requested records from the Convention Center Authority (CCA) under the Tennessee Public Records Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505ol1g" target="_self">10-7-505(g)</a></cite>, because the CCA, a public entity, disclosed the records but asserted the personal identifying information contained within them was rightfully redacted, and, as such the CCA acted in good faith; the citizen, who was also the business manager for a local union, sought the residential addresses of employees of private contractors contained in payroll records submitted to CCA. Patterson v. Convention Ctr. Auth. of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville, 421 S.W.3d 597, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 31 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 17, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 686 (Tenn.

            </p>
            <p>
             It was an abuse of discretion to deny a citizen's request for attorney's fees, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505ol1g" target="_self">10-7-505(g)</a></cite>, when a sheriff's office denied the citizen's records request, because it was error to find the office's lack of willfulness, as (1) the office was advised of relevant law that the citizen's personal appearance was not required, including an opinion of the office of open records counsel, (2) the office was unwilling to process the citizen's request absent such appearance, and (3) the sheriff's questioning of the citizen's residency was no grounds for denial, as the issue was not raised until immediately before a hearing. Friedmann v. Marshall Cnty., 471 S.W.3d 427, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 508 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2015).

            <p>
             When considering grounds for an award of attorneys'  fees under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-505ol1g" target="_self">10-7-505(g)</a></cite> to a party seeking the disclosure of public records, the statute does not mandate a heightened showing of “ill will,” “furtive design,” or any other similar connotation because, to the extent that a determination of willfulness under the statute is a “bad faith” inquiry, that inquiry should focus on whether there is an absence of good faith with respect to the legal position a municipality relies on in support of a refusal of records. Friedmann v. Marshall Cnty., 471 S.W.3d 427, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 508 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2015).

             Trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorney's fees to a requestor based upon open records requests under the Tennessee Public Records Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c07s10-7-101" target="_self">10-7-101</a></cite> et seq., because the city acted willfully in not initially complying with the requests and, instead, directing the requestor to pursue access to the requested records via the discovery process in other pending litigation. Clarke v. City of Memphis, 473 S.W.3d 285, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 584 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 23, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
             Attorneys'  fees awarded to a requestor of public records exceeded the recovery that was permitted because the requestor, who was an attorney, was only entitled to an award of attorneys'  fees attributable to the work of the requestor's attorney, and not to award of attorneys'  fees that was attributable to fees billed by the requestor. Moreover, the requestor was not entitled to an award of attorneys'  fees on the appeal because the requestor proceeded pro se and advocated on the requestor's own behalf in the appeal. Clarke v. City of Memphis, 473 S.W.3d 285, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 584 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 23, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trial court's denial of a report's request for attorney's fees was affirmed because the State's refusal to disclose records when initially asked was not “willful”; the State had a tenable, if, in the end, erroneous, basis for acting as it did because under a fair reading of the law, it could have arrived at its view that the records were exempt from disclosure. Scripps Media., Inc. v. Tenn. Dep't of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Servs., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 398 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 16, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trial court erred in denying a citizen's request for attorney's fees because a city acted willfully in violating the Tennessee Public Records Act by failing to promptly make complete crash reports available upon request; the case was remanded to the trial court to reconsider its decision not to award attorney's fees for services rendered during the trial court proceedings in light of the determination that the city acted willfully.

             In a case in which petitioner sought access to the audio recordings of his post-conviction hearing pursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act, the judge properly denied his request because the recordings were made to aid the court reporter in generating the official transcript and the recordings constituted electronic records created as part of the court's judicial process, the disclosure of which would frustrate or interfere with the judicial function of the court; and the record reflected that petitioner was provided with a copy of the official transcript that was certified by the trial court.

            Compiler's Notes. Acts 1999, ch. 304, § 1 provided: “The general assembly hereby finds and declares that the use of electronic mail by agencies, officials, and employees of state government creates unique circumstances. Electronic mail shares some features with telephonic communication, which generally is not stored in any form and is generally regarded as private. However, electronic mail differs in that it creates an electronic record that may be used or retrieved in electronic or paper format. The use of electronic mail is becoming more common and more important in facilitating the ability of government officials to gather information and communicate with their staff, other officials and agencies, and the public. However, individual officials are not equipped to act as official custodians of such communications and to determine whether or not the communications might be public records. For these reasons, the general assembly requests that a study of the use of electronic mail be conducted to balance the privacy interests and practical limitations of public officials and employees with the public policy interests in access to government information. Such study shall be conducted by the computer subcommittee of the joint management committee of the Tennessee general assembly.”

A copy of the report shall be submitted to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the speaker of the senate. In addition, each appointing authority shall designate a person responsible for retaining all applications for appointment who shall ensure that information describing each applicant's race, ethnicity, gender, and qualifications is available for public inspection during reasonable hours.
