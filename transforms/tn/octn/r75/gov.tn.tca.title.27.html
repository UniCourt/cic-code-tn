     <p>
      In all cases tried on the facts in a chancery court and afterwards brought for review to the court of appeals, the court of appeals shall, to the extent that the facts are not stipulated or are not concluded by the findings of the jury, make and file written findings of fact, which thereupon shall become a part of the record. Before any such findings shall become final, reasonable opportunity shall be afforded the parties to examine the findings and to ask for different or additional findings. Where there has been a concurrent finding of the master and chancellor, which under the principles now obtaining is binding on the appellate courts, the court of appeals shall not have the right to disturb such finding. To the extent that the findings of the chancery court and the court of appeals concur, they shall, if there be any evidence to support them, be conclusive upon any review of the facts in the supreme court; to the extent that they do not concur, they shall be open to examination in that court. The court of appeals shall not be limited to the consideration of such facts as were found or requested in the lower court, but it shall independently consider and find all material facts in the record; and either party, whether appellant or not, may assign error on the failure of the chancellor to find any material fact, without regard to whether such fact was found or requested in the lower court. This shall not apply to any case tried in the chancery court upon oral testimony.

      <p>
       This section contemplates specific findings by the chancellor and the court of appeals on the controverted issues of fact. Miller v. Kendrick, 153 Tenn. 596, 285 S.W. 51, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulation as to contents of the record for the court of appeals insures proper practice below. The effect of the regulation is to secure a bill of exceptions in every chancery case tried on oral testimony, of which a review is sought and a motion for a new trial in every such case not tried by consent of parties expressed in writing. Fonville v. Gregory, 162 Tenn. 294, 36 S.W.2d 900, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative policy deducible from the acts creating the court of appeals and defining its jurisdiction reveals an intention to relieve the supreme court of the investigation of questions of fact in chancery cases and to give the supreme court the benefit of a finding of facts by the court of appeals on all material matters. Hibbett v. Pruitt, 162 Tenn. 285, 36 S.W.2d 897, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 89 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the passage of this section, pertaining to the finding of facts by the chancellor, the practice in an equity cause is analogous to the practice in the law court, when the court is requested to and does find the facts; and his findings become a part of the technical record, and are open to review upon his conclusions from the facts, in the absence of a bill of exceptions. Ackerman v. Marable, 20 Tenn. App. 141, 95 S.W.2d 1286, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 1 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       A concurrent finding of facts by the clerk and the county judge had the same force and effect as the concurrent finding by the master and the chancellor in a chancery case. Summers v. Conger, 43 Tenn. App. 286, 307 S.W.2d 936, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 116 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section is not applicable to a workers' compensation case, as such cases are not subject to review in the court of appeals. Murray Ohio Mfg. Co. v. Vines, 498 S.W.2d 897, 1973 Tenn. LEXIS 463 (Tenn. 1973).

       Requirement of this section as to finding of facts applies only to chancery cases. Smith v. Fisher, 11 Tenn. App. 273, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 89 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929).

      <p>
       Cases “tried in the chancery court upon oral testimony” are expressly excluded from the statutory requirement that, in cases tried on the facts in a chancery court, both the chancellor and the court of appeals shall make written findings of fact. Ray v. Crain, 18 Tenn. App. 603, 80 S.W.2d 113, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934); Lincoln County Bank v. Maddox, 21 Tenn. App. 648, 114 S.W.2d 821, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 66 (Tenn. Ct.

       Provision in this section requiring chancellor to make and file finding of fact which shall become a part of the record is not applicable to law cases tried in circuit court. First Nat'l Bank v. Tate, 15 Tenn. App. 462, — S.W.2d —, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

      <p>
       A written finding of facts by the chancellor is a part of the record and need not be preserved by bill of exceptions or minute order. Crowder v. Stafford, 1 Tenn. App. 529, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the passage of Acts 1927, ch. 68 the finding of facts by the chancellor is not binding on court of appeals, but chancellor is still required to file written findings of facts as required by Acts 1925, ch. 100. Nashville v. Ward-Belmont School, 7 Tenn. App. 610, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 85 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirement to make findings is mandatory on the chancellor, but duty is on appellant to see to it that findings are incorporated into record. Stiner v. Powells Valley Hardware Co., 168 Tenn. 99, 75 S.W.2d 406, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires a finding of facts by the chancellor in all cases tried on the facts in the chancery court and brought to the court of appeals for review. National Life & Acci. Ins. Co. v. Bryant, 27 Tenn. App. 294, 179 S.W.2d 937, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 142 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings of fact of chancellor could be considered even though incorporated in the decree. Bedford County Hospital v. County of Bedford, 42 Tenn. App. 569, 304 S.W.2d 697, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

   Upon review of action of Civil Service Commission of Nashville in dismissal of employees statement of trial judge in his final order that he had considered entire record sent up from the commission, argument of counsel and briefs filed from which he found that all of the grounds for relief prayed for in the petition for certiorari were not well taken, that the action of the commission was not arbitrary, illegal and without jurisdiction; that the same was based on material, competent, relevant and reliable evidence and did not violate any constitutional rights of the petitioners constituted compliance with §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c01s27-1-113" target="_self">27-1-113</a></cite>,<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c01s27-1-114" target="_self">27-1-114</a></cite> and<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c09s27-9-111" target="_self">27-9-111</a></cite> as to findings of fact and conclusions of law under the pleadings developed in the case.

      </p>
      <p>
       The additional findings of facts sought from the chancellor which were not covered in his memorandum opinion were not determinative of the right to prevail on appeal and therefore were harmless errors. Cooper v. Cordova Sand & Gravel Co., 485 S.W.2d 261, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 253 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971).

       Findings of facts by the master, concurred in by the chancellor, held conclusive on appeal, as to advertisement and sale of an automobile which had been sold under a conditional sales contract and recovered by seller by replevin suit. Wright v. Batchelor Motor Co., 2 Tenn. App. 468, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 45 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals is not authorized to disturb master's finding of fact concurred in by chancellor. Winer v. Chattanooga Feed Co., 6 Tenn. App. 415, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 164 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the concurrent finding of the master and chancellor is one of law, or on a mixed question of law and fact, or a fact based on mere opinion of witnesses, such as estimates as to fees of attorneys, compensation of trustees, and the like, it is subject to review by the appellate court. Dale v. Hartman, 157 Tenn. 60, 6 S.W.2d 319, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Master's report, concurred in by chancellor on exceptions as to facts, has force and effect of verdict of jury and judgment thereon, and is conclusive in supreme court and court of appeals. Dale v. Hartman, 157 Tenn. 60, 6 S.W.2d 319, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Concurrence as to the value of definite items of personal property, as to which the witnesses had knowledge and as to which the appellate court could have no independent judicial judgment or opinion, is conclusive in the appellate court. Dale v. Hartman, 157 Tenn. 60, 6 S.W.2d 319, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is material evidence to support the concurrent findings of fact by the master and the chancellor, the court of appeals is bound by it. Lebanon Bank & Trust Co. v. Grandstaff, 24 Tenn. App. 162, 141 S.W.2d 924, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 24 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action to enjoin fraudulent disposal of oil lease, the bill being dismissed on motion of complainant, and case being referred to clerk and master to determine damages to defendants arising out of wrongful injunction, evidence sustained amount of damages found by clerk and master, and by the chancellor. Reagan v. Wolsieffer, 34 Tenn. App. 537, 240 S.W.2d 273, 1951 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals would not disturb findings in report of special master concurred in by the special master and the chancellor. Kelso v. Kelso, 40 Tenn. App. 681, 292 S.W.2d 483, 1955 Tenn. App. LEXIS 117 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1955); Hunt v. Temco, Inc., 61 Tenn. App. 35, 452 S.W.2d 879, 1969 Tenn. App. LEXIS 282 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court of appeals has no power to disturb a concurrent finding of fact made by the master and chancellor in a matter of accounting, if there is any material evidence to support such finding. Pitt v. Bacherig, 43 Tenn. App. 273, 307 S.W.2d 798, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 114 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       A concurrence of the master and the chancellor is conclusive on appeal except (1) where it is upon an issue not proper to be referred, (2) where it is based on an error of law, (3) where it is upon a question of law or mixed fact and law, or (4) where it is not supported by any material evidence. Staggs v. Herff Motor Co., 216 Tenn. 113, 390 S.W.2d 245, 1965 Tenn. LEXIS 563 (1965); Ferrell v. Elrod, 63 Tenn. App. 129, 469 S.W.2d 678, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 259 (Tenn. Ct.

      </p>
      <p>
       Joint finding by chancellor and master has the same force and effect as a verdict of a jury approved by the trial judge. Ferrell v. Elrod, 63 Tenn. App. 129, 469 S.W.2d 678, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 259 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appellate court has no right to disturb findings by a special master concurred in by the chancellor unless it is a matter which should not have been referred to the master, or there is no evidence to sustain the finding. Hopkins v. First Tennessee Nat'l Bank, 560 S.W.2d 916, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 302 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977); Security Land Co. v. Touliatos, 716 S.W.2d 918, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 777 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Concurrent findings by the master and the trial court have the same force and effect as a jury verdict and will generally not be disturbed by the appellate courts. In re Estate of Wallace, 829 S.W.2d 696, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings concerning the fees charged by executors, administrators, and other professionals assisting in the administration of an estate involve mixed questions of law and fact and are not subject to the concurrent finding rule. In re Estate of Wallace, 829 S.W.2d 696, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Special master's finding of the appropriate “starting point” for calculating a debtor's debt to a creditor was not disturbed on appeal because material evidence supported the concurrent findings of the special master and a chancery court on the issue, so the findings were binding on appeal. Delta Dev. Corp. v. F. Fani Gulf Int'l, 393 S.W.3d 185, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 222 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 594 (Tenn. Aug. 16, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the master made findings of fact that were adopted by the chancellor, the trial court's findings of fact were conclusive on appeal, but this standard of review did not apply to conclusions of law or mixed questions of fact and law. In re King, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 638 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 6, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the spouse's request for additional amounts of support, to the extent she challenged the factual findings, this failed due to the concurrent findings rule, which made the trial court's findings of fact conclusive on appeal; to the extent some of the findings were mixed questions of fact and law, no error was found. In re King, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 638 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 6, 2015).

       As a prerequisite to the review of the facts in the court of appeals, it is necessary that appellant incorporate in the record a bill of exceptions. Ackerman v. Marable, 20 Tenn. App. 141, 95 S.W.2d 1286, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 1 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934). But see J. C. Bradford & Co. v. Martin Constr. Co., 576 S.W.2d 586, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 415 (Tenn. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consideration by the court of appeals of a stenographic report of the chancellor's oral opinion which was not authenticated by the chancellor, even though stipulated by the parties to be correct, contravenes unyielding rule requiring authentication by the chancellor of extraneous matter before such matter can become part of the record. Freeman v. Freeman, 197 Tenn. 75, 270 S.W.2d 364, 1954 Tenn. LEXIS 456 (1954).

       The appellate court is precluded from passing on questions of fact that the chancellor was not requested to find, or that he did not, in fact, pass upon. Edington v. Kreis-Keener Shoe Co., 153 Tenn. 323, 283 S.W. 987, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper practice where chancery court fails to make findings is for court of appeals to remand for making of adequate findings. Hicks v. Hicks, 168 Tenn. 539, 79 S.W.2d 802, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals is entitled to affirm decree of chancery court where findings are suppressed. Stiner v. Powells Valley Hardware Co., 168 Tenn. 99, 75 S.W.2d 406, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals was not entitled to affirm decree where there was no finding of fact or where finding made was inadequate. Hicks v. Hicks, 168 Tenn. 539, 79 S.W.2d 802, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily the weight and credibility of oral testimony is to be determined by the chancellor and will not be disturbed on appeal. Haynes v. Cumberland Builders, Inc., 565 S.W.2d 887, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 283 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).

       Where a defendant filed a petition for the finding by the chancellor of additional facts, which the chancellor declined on the ground that the facts so requested to be found were covered by the facts already found, or were immaterial, or not supported by a preponderance of the testimony, the court of appeals will examine the record and the cause to determine error on the part of the chancellor in so ruling. Dushan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 4 Tenn. App. 614, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 205 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926), superseded by statute as stated in, Armstrong v. Pilot Life Ins.

       Chancellor's refusal to make additional finding of facts was cause for reversal, on the record. Dushan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 4 Tenn. App. 614, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where chancellor's decree dismissing complainant's bill is supported by the facts found by him, there is no occasion for the court of appeals to adjudge the legal effect of additional facts pleaded by the defendant and shown by the proof. National Acceptance Co. v. Royal Indem. Co., 9 Tenn. App. 515, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929).

       On appeal in the nature of a writ of error, it was held that the provision for a presumption in favor of the judgment below casts the burden of carrying the preponderance of the evidence on the appellant or plaintiff in error, and if he does not carry it, he is not entitled to a reversal. He cannot carry his burden if the record does not include a bill of exceptions containing the evidence on which the judgment below was rendered. Morrell v. Republic Fire Ins.

       It is not necessary that the court of appeals make a detailed statement, or review, of the “voluminous evidence” in the record as to issues decided by the chancellor in his findings. Hamby v. Northcut, 25 Tenn. App. 11, 149 S.W.2d 484, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 87 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).

       Issues not submitted to jury in an equity case, are for determination by the court and will be tried de novo on appeal. Warner v. Maroney, 16 Tenn. App. 78, 66 S.W.2d 244, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 40 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor's granting of motion for directed verdict amounted to finding that the evidence was undisputed, and his instruction to return a negative verdict withdrew the issue from the jury; so that on appeal that issue was triable de novo. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Burton, 167 Tenn. 606, 72 S.W.2d 778, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1934).

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the resolution of whether an aunt owned an undivided one-half interest in the property issue hinged on the interpretation of a trust document, it was a question of law; consequently, the concurrent finding by the special master and the chancery court was not conclusive, and the court of appeals reviewed it de novo with no presumption of correctness accorded to the trial court. Breen v. Sharp, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 742 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 182 (Tenn. Mar. 15, 2018).

       The duty is not imposed on the court of appeals of finding facts not found by the chancellor in a case where the facts expressly found by the chancellor afford a sufficient legal predicate for his decree, and there is no assignment of errors upon the failure of the chancellor to find additional facts. Freed v. Freed, 9 Tenn. App. 691, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 131 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929). See also Dacus v. Knoxville Outfitting Co., 9 Tenn. App. 683, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn.

       The court of appeals is under the duty of making a written finding of facts, and not simply to accept the chancellor's finding as conclusive, in those equity cases “where the material evidence is nearly evenly balanced.” Hibbett v.

       The court of appeals is not limited to facts found by the chancellor and is under duty to consider all material facts in the record, but if the “judgment” is supported by a preponderance of the evidence it will be affirmed, whether the court of appeals agrees with the chancellor's finding of facts or not.

       Findings of facts by court of appeals are binding on the supreme court unless challenged by petition for certiorari. Kenner v. City Nat'l Bank, 164 Tenn. 119, 46 S.W.2d 46, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1932), rehearing denied, 164 Tenn. 288, 47 S.W.2d 756, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of certiorari was denied by supreme court where court of appeals affirmed decree of chancery court due to absence of findings from record, since court assumed that findings were omitted because findings were adverse to appellant. Stiner v. Powells Valley Hardware Co., 168 Tenn. 99, 75 S.W.2d 406, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Question of law is presented by assignment that verdict was not supported by evidence or that trial court erred in its ruling on motion for directed verdict; and where petition for certiorari is filed to obtain review of judgment rendered by court of appeals, all evidence in record is examined by supreme court to ascertain whether right conclusion was reached on question of law thus presented. Ray v. Crain, 18 Tenn. App. 603, 80 S.W.2d 113, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where court of appeals committed error in affirming decree of chancery court due to absence of finding, and supreme court granted writ of certiorari, an oral argument was not necessary, since case had not been finally determined by court of appeals. Hicks v. Hicks, 168 Tenn. 539, 79 S.W.2d 802, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was material evidence in the record to support the factual conclusion of both the trial court and the court of appeals, it was foreclosed on appeal to the supreme court.

       Where the findings of the chancellor are not appealed from and there is no concurrent finding by the court of appeals, the supreme court need not read the record to determine the facts relied on. Edington v. Kreis-Keener Shoe Co., 153 Tenn. 323, 283 S.W. 987, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       A review of the facts by the supreme court is permissible only to the extent that the findings of the chancellor and the court of appeals are shown by the record to be contradictory. Miller v. Kendrick, 153 Tenn. 596, 285 S.W. 51, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1925); Cooley v. East & West Ins. Co., 166 Tenn. 405, 61 S.W.2d 656, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 149 (1933); Joest v. John A.

      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that the findings of the trial judge and of the court of appeals do not concur, the facts are open to a de novo examination in the supreme court with the presumption, however, that the judgment of the trial court was correct unless the evidence preponderates against it. Columbia v. C.F.W. Constr. Co., 557 S.W.2d 734, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 678 (Tenn. 1977).

       Concurrent findings of fact by chancellor and the court of appeals are conclusive on supreme court, if findings are supported by material evidence. Knight v.

      <p>
       Findings of the chancellor and of the court of appeals upholding a settlement pleading in a suit for accounting are binding on the supreme court, though the two lower courts differed as to where lay the burden of proof, on the complainant or on the defendant. Miller v. Kendrick, 153 Tenn. 596, 285 S.W. 51, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1925).

      <p>
       <p>
   Where there was abundant evidence to sustain a finding of fact made by the lower court in a chancery case, which finding was concurred in by the court of appeals, such finding is conclusive on the supreme court. Harwood-Yancey Co. v. Lawrenceburg Warehouse Co., 167 Tenn. 14, 65 S.W.2d 192, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1933), cert. denied, Striplin v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section the supreme court is not only bound by concurrent finding of facts by the chancellor and the court of appeals but is also bound by concurrently found inferences from such facts if such inferences are justifiably drawn and all that remains to the supreme court in such a case is a determination of whether or not such inferences were to be fairly drawn from such undisputed facts. Conaway v. New York Life Ins. Co., 171 Tenn. 290, 102 S.W.2d 66, 1936 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1937).

       Where the court of appeals stated that “for the purpose of disposition of what we think is the determinative question it may be assumed that the chancellor was correct” as to his findings, this amounted to a concurrent finding by the chancellor and the court of appeals. Joest v. John A. Denie's Sons Co., 174 Tenn. 410, 126 S.W.2d 312, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1939).

       If there is any evidence in the record to support a concurrent finding of the chancery court and the court of appeals, it is binding on supreme court. Provident Wash. Ins. Co. v.

      <p>
       It was argued in a petition to rehear that both the trial court and the court of appeals found as a fact that a certain memorandum was the contract of insurance and that the supreme court is bound by such concurrent finding of fact; however, the proper construction of an unambiguous written instrument presents a question of law for the court, not a question of fact. Provident Wash. Ins. Co. v. Reese, 213 Tenn. 355, 373 S.W.2d 613, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 499 (1963), rehearing denied, Provident Washington Ins. Co. v. Reese, 213 Tenn. 355, 373 S.W.2d 613, 1964 Tenn.

       Suits for divorce are treated as chancery suits so that concurrent findings by the trial judge and the court of appeals are conclusive on the supreme court. Moore v. Moore, 224 Tenn. 611, 460 S.W.2d 844, 1970 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1970).

       Where documentary evidence and testimony of petitioner's secretary provided material evidence in support of the factual finding of the Chancellor and the court of appeals, that concurrent finding was conclusive in the supreme court. Hickory Springs Mfg. Co. v. Evans, 541 S.W.2d 97, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 526 (Tenn. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial judge has failed to make specific findings, although a particular finding might be considered to be implicit in his holding, the supreme court is not bound by the “concurrent finding of fact” rule on the theory that the trial judge and the court of appeals have made concurrent findings, and in such situations the supreme court will review the record with a view to determine where the preponderance of the evidence lies with respect to the issue of fact in question. Columbia v. C.F.W. Constr. Co., 557 S.W.2d 734, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 678 (Tenn. 1977).
      </p>

       A concurrent finding of fact by the trial court and the appeals court, being supported by material evidence, is binding on the supreme court. Broyles v. Ford Life Ins. Co., 594 S.W.2d 691, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 412 (Tenn. 1980).

      <p>
       The rule that concurrent findings of the chancery court and the court of appeals are binding on the supreme court, if there be any evidence to support them, applies only to findings of fact, not to conclusions of law.

      The court of appeals shall file its findings at the same time that it renders its decision. It shall be the duty of chancellors, except where the findings are or have been incorporated in the decree as above provided, to file their findings of fact within thirty (30) days after appeal; and the clerk shall then give notice thereof to the parties or their counsel, who shall have the right by petition to ask for different or additional findings; and, if no such petition shall be filed within five (5) days after such notice, unless the time shall be extended by order of the court, the findings shall not be further questioned in that court; provided, that the time in which such petition may be filed shall in no event be less than five (5) days from the taking of an appeal. For the purposes stated, the cause shall remain in the chancery court even after the appeal has been taken. The same rules and practice shall govern with respect to cases tried on the facts in courts exercising the former jurisdictions of county courts and thence brought directly to the court of appeals. The provisions as to a finding of facts shall not apply where, before it is made up, the judge who tried the case has died or has gone out of office, and in such case the clerk shall include in the record a certificate to that effect.

       Judgment of Supreme Court may be corrected to conform to opinion which is recognized as part of the record of the cause; and if the decree of the court does not properly embody the judgment of the court as it appears from the opinion, it may be corrected at the next term.

       Where defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter and his conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court, but through error, the clerk in drawing the judgment against him, entered judgment that the defendant was guilty of the offense of voluntary manslaughter the judgment could be corrected to conform to the opinion since the opinions of the justices are recognized as a part of the record of the case.

     <p>
      When it appears to any reviewing court that the appeal from any court of record was frivolous or taken solely for delay, the court may, either upon motion of a party or of its own motion, award just damages against the appellant, which may include, but need not be limited to, costs, interest on the judgment, and expenses incurred by the appellee as a result of the appeal.

       This statute does not give the court statutory or inherent power to award damages for the initiation of frivolous suits, and where employee brought frivolous suit under workers' compensation law and lower court improvidently decided in her favor, employer could not be granted damages upon his appeal from the judgment. Bishop Baking Co. v. Forgey, 538 S.W.2d 602, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 493 (Tenn. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petition to hold appellees in contempt of court was dismissed by trial court, appellees were entitled to relief under this section since there was no right to appeal from acquittal in a contempt case and there was no factual evidence contrary to the trial court's holding. Zwick v. Jones, 589 S.W.2d 664, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 342 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the court determines a martial dissolution agreement (MDA) is inapplicable, it should so state on the record and then turn to the parties'  statutory claims under which any award of fees is within the sound discretion of the trial or appellate courts unless otherwise specified in the statute; even if the court determines an award of attorney's fees is mandated by the terms of the MDA, the court still should also review the claims for fees or expenses under any applicable statutory authority. Eberbach v. Eberbach, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 23, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important for the courts to ensure they conduct an analysis under both the parties'  contract and any applicable statutes or other equitable grounds, and in the event the award is reversed on one ground, it may be upheld on another; analyzing all applicable grounds for attorney's fee awards ensures judicial economy is maximized. Eberbach v. Eberbach, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 23, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where parties seek attorney's fees under statutory authority alone, the statute governs the award, is the exception to the American Rule, and is the basis for the court's authority to grant fees on appeal; thus, when appellate attorney's fees are requested pursuant to statutes that expressly permit the court to exercise its discretion, the court of appeals should analyze a request by exercising its discretion to determine whether an award to the prevailing party is appropriate. Eberbach v. Eberbach, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 23, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because fee provisions in marital dissolution agreements are binding on the parties, when confronted with a request for fees under both contractual and statutory authority, the courts should look to the parties'  contract first before moving on to any discretionary analysis under statutes. Eberbach v. Eberbach, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (Tenn. May 23, 2017).

       Where employee in workers' compensation case adduced no evidence to dispute testimony of employer's witnesses, a successful appeal by defendant would have required a de novo review of the evidence, contrary to state practice, so that defendant's appeal was frivolous. Davis v. Gulf Ins. Group, 546 S.W.2d 583, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 519 (Tenn. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appellate court invoked this section sua sponte where defendant filed a complaint alleging that the trial court judgment was void from the beginning because the defendant was denied an adequate opportunity to prepare its defense. Norton Creek Community Asso. v. Rodman Corp., 560 S.W.2d 914, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 301 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).

      <p>
       When an appeal in a workers' compensation case had no reasonable chance of success and the material issues raised by the appeal were issues of fact with material evidence supporting the trial judge's findings on those issues, the appeal was frivolous and appellee was entitled to damages under this section. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 590 S.W.2d 920, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 523 (Tenn. 1979); Bailey v. Knox County, 732 S.W.2d 597, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1006 (Tenn. 1987).

       Where hospital defendant in malpractice action was granted a summary judgment prior to the hearing of evidence it was a violation of Tenn. Const., art. I, § 6 to grant a motion to add the hospital as a party defendant after the evidence had been presented, and the appeal of the rejection of that motion was frivolous. Guess v. Maury, 726 S.W.2d 906, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3257 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1986), overruled in part, Elliott v. Cobb, 320 S.W.3d 246,  2010 Tenn. LEXIS 875 (Tenn. Sept. 23, 2010).

   The failure to provide a transcript from which the appellate court could determine sufficiency of evidence resulted in a frivolous appeal. McDonald v. Onoh, 772 S.W.2d 913, 1989 Tenn.

       Court granted costs and attorney fees in frivolous appeal in legal malpractice action because plaintiff failed to introduce a counter expert affidavit even though he had asked for a continuance to obtain such an affidavit.

       Delinquent taxpayer who unsuccessfully appealed dismissal of an action to quiet title and set aside a tax lien on the taxpayer's property was not sanctioned.

       In a personal injury suit, defendant was entitled to damages for a frivolous appeal because plaintiff's appeal, although it was nominally an appeal from a subsequent lawsuit, raised issues against defendant solely related to an original trial that had concluded over four months prior to the notice of appeal. Young v. Barrow, 130 S.W.3d 59, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 678 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (Tenn. Jan. 26, 2004).

       Optionor's request for attorney fees for a frivolous appeal were denied where the optionee appealed the trial court's decision that the option contract had expired; the optionee claimed that it had been impossible to give notice of his intention to exercise the option on the last day of the contract, because the optionor had been out of town on that day. Silsbe v. Houston Levee Indus. Park, Inc., 165 S.W.3d 260, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 583 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, Silsbe v. Houston Levee Indus. Park, L.L.C., — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn.

       Where notice of a tax sale had not been given, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment to the owners in their suit against the purchaser and in denying the purchaser's Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 motion to set aside the summary judgment; the purchaser's post-judgment evidence would not have created genuine issue of material fact as to whether notice of the tax sale had been given and her appeal of the trial court's denial was frivolous, justifying an award of damages to the owners including their attorney's fees and expenses incurred in defending the appeal.

       Court should tread carefully before concluding that an appeal is frivolous; in this case, the issues raised by defendant were so devoid of merit that they had no reasonable chance of success, such that the appeal was frivolous and plaintiff was entitled to the costs incurred in defending against it.

       Appellees contended that appellants'  disregard for the appellate rules on briefs warranted frivolous appeal damages, plus the appeal lacked any merit, as evidenced by appellants'  resort to unsupported allegations that did not appear in the record; the appeal was frivolous and damages were awarded to appellees.

       Frivolous attorney fees were denied; although plaintiff's appeal was not successful, the appeal was not frivolous or taken solely for delay, her brief was fully compliant with the rule and her argument was cogent, and it appeared the trial court failed to address plaintiff's contentions and plaintiff would not be sanctioned for seeking redress.

       Where the facts of the case have been fairly left to the jury, upon a proper charge of the court, and they have twice found a verdict for the same party, each of which was set aside by the court, and the same party shall obtain another verdict in like manner supported by any evidence, it shall not be disturbed.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A third verdict or any number of verdicts may be set aside and new trials granted for errors in the charge, improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for misconduct of the jury, and the like, if stated upon the record. East T. &amp; G. R. Co. v. Hackney, 38 Tenn. 169, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1858); Whitemore v. Haroldson, 70 Tenn. 312, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 235 (1879); Burton v.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section has no application to a case where there is no evidence to support the verdict, and, in such case, the trial judge may set aside the third verdict or any subsequent verdict in the same case, and upon motion of the same party. Railway Co. V. Mahoney, 89 Tenn. 311, 15 S.W. 652, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1890); Railroad v. Green, 100 Tenn. 238, 47 S.W. 221, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1897); Jacks v.

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute does not apply where one of the two preceding verdicts was set aside for surprise on account of the introduction of the testimony of a witness. Railroad v. Blair, 104 Tenn. 212, 55 S.W. 154, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1899).

        5. No Evidence to Support Verdict.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The contention that there is no evidence to sustain the verdict cannot be successfully maintained “if the conclusion does not follow, as a matter of law, that no recovery can be had upon any view which can be properly taken of the fact the evidence tends to establish.” Railway Co. V. Mahoney, 89 Tenn. 311, 15 S.W. 652, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1890).

        6. Disregard of Court's Charge.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Refusal of the jury to regard the court's charges is not such misconduct as entitles the trial judge to grant more than two trials. Burton v. Gray, Kirkman & Co., 78 Tenn. 580, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 227 (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       Entry on grant of a new trial that “the jury disobeyed the instructions and the verdict is against the preponderance of the evidence” shows the court's action to have been on the facts, and grant of a third new trial is precluded. Railroad v. Green, 100 Tenn. 238, 47 S.W. 221, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1897).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t27c02s27-2-101-NOTESTODECISIONS-7.PresumptionandBurdenofProof.">
       <span class="boldspan">
        7. Presumption and Burden of Proof.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The conclusive presumption is that the verdict was set aside, and a new trial granted, for insufficiency of the evidence, unless the record itself shows that it was done for some one of the excepted causes; and the party who seeks to sustain the action of the court in setting aside a third verdict must be able to show from the record itself that the new trials were granted for one or more of the following causes: error in charge of court, in admission or rejection of testimony, or misconduct of the jury, and the like. Ferrell v. Alder, 32 Tenn. 77, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1852); Railroad v. Green, 100 Tenn. 238, 47 S.W. 221, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1897); Jacks v. Williams-Robinson Lumber Co., 125 Tenn. 123, 140 S.W. 1066, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (Tenn. Sep. 1911).

        8. Amendments.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The fact that new counts, which vary the form but do not change the cause of action, have been added to the declaration after two new trials have been granted, will not affect the operation of the law denying a third new trial. East T. & G. R. Co. v. Hackney, 38 Tenn. 169, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1858).

       A broad appeal from the county court to the circuit court gives a trial of the whole case de novo in the circuit court; but an appeal in error entitles the appellant to a review of the case as tried in the county court.

       Where widow excepted from action of county court in confirming report of commissioners under which year's support had been set apart from husband's estate, and appealed in error directly to court of appeals when motion for new trial was overruled, court of appeals had jurisdiction of appeal inasmuch as widow and executor consented of record that appeal be taken directly from circuit court. Redmon v. Fuller, 23 Tenn. App. 623, 136 S.W.2d 724, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939), superseded by statute as stated in, In re Estate of Truett, — S.W.2d —, 1997 Tenn.

       The circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the judgment of the county court sustaining the action of the clerk of the county court (now county clerk) in refusing to accept or file a suggestion of insolvency tendered by the creditor of an estate. Motlow Milling Co. v. Warterfield, 178 Tenn. 634, 162 S.W.2d 378, 1942 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1942).

       Section 27-4-108 does not require that all appeals from the county court to the circuit court except jury cases and chancery cases be reviewed as appeals in the nature of writs of error are reviewed rather than as appeals, which afford de novo hearings in the circuit court. Delffs v. Delffs, 545 S.W.2d 739, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. 1977), rejecting dictum in Griffitts v. Rockford Utility Dist., 41 Tenn. App. 653, 298 S.W.2d 33, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct.

       This section and Rule 24 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure are geared toward a correction of the record, rather than a remand after reversal of the trial court.

       Where the record did not include any factual findings or legal conclusions detailing the basis for the trial court's award to a contractor, the case was remanded for findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient for the appellate court to ascertain the basis for trial court's calculation of its award to the contractor in the suit brought against homeowners for whom he had been constructing a house. John Allen Constr., LLC v. Hancock, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 149 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 1, 2006).

   In a case in which the father appealed the juvenile court's legitimation of his child and direction that its surname be changed to a hyphenation of the mother's maiden name and the father's surname, the appellate court had to apply T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c03s27-3-128" target="_self">27-3-128</a></cite> in order to do justice and it remanded the case to the juvenile court for it to supplement the record with its subsequent order granting custody to the father and proof and findings as to what the child's surname should have been in light of the child's best interest and the Barbas v. Rogers, 868 S.W.2d 283, factors. Christ v. Homonai, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 606 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2006).

       Case was remanded to trial court because its oral ruling awarding damages to a property owner of $20,000 for damage to a carport appeared to be internally inconsistent and the appellate court could not determine whether the trial court's decision was the result of a mistake or whether in light of the evidence before it, it made findings not expressly stated in its oral ruling.

       Where a neighbor made improvements to a property owner's land, there was an implied contract in law because the property owner should have known that the neighbor would have expected some compensation for the work; however, remand was necessary because the proper award would be providing a quantum meruit award based upon the reasonable value of the neighbor's services, rather than the increased value of the property.

   Although a neighbor appealed a chancery court's decision finding a prescriptive easement in favor of landowners, the appellate court remanded the matter, pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c03s27-3-128" target="_self">27-3-128</a></cite>, for preparation of a proper statement of the evidence because the statement of the evidence presented to the appellate court was prepared by the neighbor, reflected no evidence bearing on the elements of an easement, and only presented evidence in favor of the neighbor.

       This section does not authorize courts to indulge piecemeal and protracted litigation concerning facts that should have obviously been established at the original trial. Killian v. Campbell, 760 S.W.2d 218, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 476 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).

       Plaintiff's failure to attempt to prove damages was not a mere “oversight without culpable negligence.” Killian v. Campbell, 760 S.W.2d 218, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 476 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).

   Unlike an order of remand following reversal or an order under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c03s27-3-128" target="_self">27-3-128</a></cite> instructing the trial court to conduct further proceedings with respect to a specific issue, the appellate court's 2003 order directed the trial court to include a holding on the parishioner's assault claim based on evidence presented at the 2001 trial. Ruff v. Raleigh Assembly of God Church, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 385 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 21, 2007), superseded, Ruff v. Raleigh Assembly of God Church, 241 S.W.3d 876, 2007 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       On remand, the trial court was not required to permit a parishioner to conduct additional discovery and to hold a new trial or evidentiary hearing with respect to his assault claim against the church, as the appellate court had directed the trial court to correct its order by specifically including a holding on the assault claim based on the evidence presented at previous trial; nothing further was required by the trial court. Ruff v. Raleigh Assembly of God Church, 241 S.W.3d 876, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 457 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 23, 2007), appeal denied, Ruff v. Raleigh Assembly of God Church, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn.

       The provision for an appeal by “any person dissatisfied” did not mean that one without interest in the subject matter, and one not aggrieved or prejudiced by the decree was entitled to an appeal.

       In insolvency proceedings to sell lands of a decedent to pay his debts, where the county court has exclusive jurisdiction because the decedent's estate does not exceed the value of $1,000, the appeal from the decree or judgment of the county court lies to the circuit court; but if the proceedings in such case are conducted according to chancery practice, and not according to the procedure prescribed by certain sections, then the appeal from the county court lies directly to the Supreme Court. Phillips v. Hoffman, 45 Tenn. 251, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1868); Key v. Harris, 116 Tenn. 161, 92 S.W. 235, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1905); Harness v. Hughett, 117 Tenn. 489, 97 S.W. 68, 1906 Tenn.

       The requirement that the “transcript of the record” shall be delivered to the circuit court clerk means that a transcript of the whole record upon which the lower court predicated its judgment be thus delivered, and is not satisfied by filing a certified copy of the judgment accompanied by an affidavit of counsel attempting to explain the failure of appellant to file a full transcript of the record.

       Where county court had confirmed an executor's final settlement and appeal from such confirmance had been dismissed because transcript of record was not delivered to clerk of circuit court in the required time and there was no showing that executor had caused the delay, such confirmance of the final settlement was conclusive and could not, upon a suit being brought to surcharge and falsify executor's final settlement, be reviewed by the chancery court.

       Where issues of fact are made up and tried before the county court, and an appeal is taken to the circuit court, the case should be reheard upon the merits, and not upon a writ of error. Roberts & Philips v. Stewart, 9 Tenn. 390, 1830 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1830); Patton v. Clark, 17 Tenn. 268, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1836); Lafollette v. Tiller, 105 Tenn. 536, 58 S.W. 1065 (1900).

       Hearings in circuit courts of appeals from county court appointments of administrators or executors are de novo in nature rather than in the nature of writs of error, and therefore filing a bill of exceptions is not essential to circuit court review.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require that all appeals from the county court to the circuit court except jury cases and chancery cases be reviewed as appeals in the nature of writs of error are reviewed rather than as appeals, which afford de novo hearings in the circuit court.

      <p>
       Where petitioner who was convicted in municipal court appealed to circuit court and, pending appeal, was tried in circuit court on charges arising from same cause, such action was double jeopardy even though such appeal had the effect of setting aside conviction and granting petitioner a trial de novo. Pettyjohn v. Evatt, 369 F. Supp. 865, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12618 (E.D. Tenn. 1974), aff'd without opinion, 500 F.2d 1403 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1974).

      </h4>
      <p>
       An appeal from the judgment of a city recorder gives a retrial in the circuit court, where the matter will be heard de novo, under the rules of practice applicable to civil cases, and the judgment need not be an affirmance or dismissal, but may be for any amount within the limit of the ordinance, in the discretion of the court. Memphis v. Schade, 59 Tenn. 579, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       A circuit court hearing a probation revocation appeal from a municipal court must make an independent judgment following the presentation of proof; merely reviewing the municipal court judgment for abuse of discretion does not satisfy the requirements of this section.

       Circuit court did not err in denying appellant's motion to quash execution because it had jurisdiction and authority to issue execution to enforce its order; in affirming the judgment entered in favor of appellee in the general sessions court, the circuit court's intent was to adopt the general sessions judgment as its own because in its order denying appellant's motion to quash execution the circuit court stated that appellee was entitled to execute the general sessions judgment because it was treated as if the judgment had been rendered in the circuit court.

       Statute addresses those situations where the circuit court appellant is the original general sessions court defendant and fails to appear in circuit court; in this case, the company was the original defendant, and it was the insurer, the original plaintiff in general sessions court and the appellee in the circuit court appeal, that failed to appear to defend against the company's motion to dismiss the circuit court case, and thus the statute was not dispositive of the instant appeal.

   Circuit court properly remanded the case for execution of the judgment because defendant failed to appear and prosecute his appeal, and plaintiff was entitled to have judgment final, by default, for the amount of the judgment of the court of general sessions under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-106" target="_self">27-5-106</a></cite> and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-107" target="_self">27-5-107</a></cite>; also, because the circuit court's judgment was for dismissal and costs of the appeal only, the general sessions judgment was reinstated and enforceable.

       In a case stemming from property damage, a trial court did not err by allowing a property owner to dismiss the lawsuit following an appeal by an adjacent landowner from a general sessions court judgment in favor of the property owner; a voluntary nonsuit was permitted at any time before the trial of a cause, and there was no authority holding that the party not filing an appeal from general sessions court was not allowed to nonsuit the action in circuit court. An argument that it was unfair to allow the owner to nonsuit the action and then potentially refile his claim in circuit court, seeking a larger amount of damages, because he did not appeal the general sessions judgment was rejected under the savings statute.

       Where the appeal from a justice (now general sessions judge) is dismissed by the circuit court, with costs against the appellant, and the records show that the justice's judgment was not in fact, or intended to be affected, such action reinstates the judgment vacated by the appeal, and it may be proceeded on, as effectually as if a procedendo had been awarded. Anderson v. Moore, 63 Tenn. 15, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 193 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voluntary dismissal without prejudice pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01 of appeal from general sessions court to circuit court did not require affirmance of general sessions judgment under this section. Katz v. Bilsky, 759 S.W.2d 420, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 226 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon dismissal of an appeal for failure of appellant to appear and prosecute, it is the duty of the circuit court to render judgment for the amount of the general sessions court's judgment. However, if the circuit court judgment is for dismissal and costs only, the general sessions judgment is reinstated and may be enforced as if a procedendo had been awarded. Steve Frost Agency v. Spurlock, 859 S.W.2d 337, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 213 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In Tennessee, a circuit court is not required to issue a written procedendo in order to reinstate the order of the general sessions court; rather, upon dismissal of the action, the general sessions judgment is revived as if the circuit court had, in fact, issued a mandate to the lower court. Cantrell v. Tolley, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 433 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in denying appellant's motion to quash execution because it had jurisdiction and authority to issue execution to enforce its order; in affirming the judgment entered in favor of appellee in the general sessions court, the circuit court's intent was to adopt the general sessions judgment as its own because in its order denying appellant's motion to quash execution the circuit court stated that appellee was entitled to execute the general sessions judgment because it was treated as if the judgment had been rendered in the circuit court. Cantrell v. Tolley, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 433 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   If the circuit court's order merely dismisses the appeal and assesses costs, then the order constitutes an affirmance of the general sessions court's order in the sense that the order of dismissal functions as either a reviver of the general sessions order or as an automatic procedendo for execution in the general sessions court, and the result is the same, the general sessions judgment is affirmed, thus satisfying the mandates of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-107" target="_self">27-5-107</a></cite>, but jurisdiction would return to the general sessions court upon dismissal of the appeal; however, if the circuit court specifically affirms the judgment of the general sessions court, then the judgment of the general sessions court becomes the judgment of the circuit court. In such a case, jurisdiction remains with the circuit court to execute its judgment. Cantrell v. Tolley, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 433 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2011).

       Circuit court's January 2017 judgment dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remanded for distribution of the bond, such that the general sessions court's subsequent ruling on plaintiffs'  motion to recover was an enforcement of the prior judgment, not a modification.

       Instead of the circuit court's issuing its own order of disbursal upon its finding that it could provide no relief, the circuit court dismissed the appeal and remanded to the general sessions court for enforcement of the original judgment, which was not error.

       Where the appeal from the justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment is dismissed in the circuit court, on motion of the appellant, the circuit court, having jurisdiction, should affirm the justice's judgment, with costs; and the Supreme Court will correct the error of the circuit court in its refusal to dismiss the appeal, and to render the proper judgment of affirmance.

       Circuit court did not err in dismissing a driver's appeal of a general sessions court judgment entered against her because an appellant from general sessions court could effect the involuntary dismissal of plaintiffs' additional claims asserted in circuit court by filing a notice of dismissal of appeal and motion to affirm general sessions judgment at any time before trial in the circuit court; no rule, statute, or court decision changes the long-standing principle that the appellant from a judgment of the general sessions court may dismiss his or her appeal at any time prior to trial in circuit court, which action necessitates the dismissal of the circuit court action and the affirmance or reinstatement of the general sessions judgment.

       Where the papers do not show that an appeal from the justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment was prayed and granted, or where they show that it was prayed and granted after the expiration of the time allowed by statute for appealing, the proper judgment in the circuit court dismissing such appeal, on the appellee's motion, and the proper judgment in the appellate or Supreme Court, is not an affirmance of the justice's judgment, but the award of a procedendo to the justice, and for costs of such appeal against the appellant. Such appeal gives no jurisdiction to the circuit court, or to the appellate or Supreme Court, except to award the procedendo and to give judgment for costs. Jackson v.

   Record reflected that the insureds, in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, relied upon the deposition of an expert consulting engineer, whose testimony controverted the deposition testimony of the insurer's expert. Under those circumstances, there was a genuine dispute as to material facts, and summary judgment was not appropriate; the order of the chancery court granting summary judgment was vacated, and the order of the circuit court transferring the case to chancery court was vacated, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings in a trial de novo as provided by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-108" target="_self">27-5-108</a></cite>.

       Owner's petition to rehear sought to set aside the General Sessions Court judgment entered on July 28, 2003, in favor of the utility company, but regardless of whether the petition was filed within the ten-day period for appeal, the General Sessions Court had no statutory authority to grant the relief requested and the petition did not toll the appeal period; the ten-day period for seeking a de novo review in the circuit court began to run when the general sessions final judgment was entered, and because the owner's appeal was filed outside the ten-day time period, the appeal was untimely and it was properly dismissed. Jackson Energy Auth. v. Diamond, 181 S.W.3d 735, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 22 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 700 (Tenn. Aug. 22, 2005).

       Condominium owner had 10 days to appeal to the circuit court from an adverse decision in the general sessions court; however, the condominium owner did not appeal, but instead waited approximately eight months to file suit in the chancery court raising the same claims.

R. Civ. P. 60.02 motion in the General Sessions Court constituted an attempt to bootstrap their untimely Rule 60.02 motion to negate the finality of the judgments against them and establish jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.

       As a general rule, an appellant may have his appeal dismissed at any time the cause remains within the jurisdiction of the appellate court, and the appellee cannot object, nor is his consent required.

       Circuit court erred in dismissing an appeal of a legal malpractice action merely because appellant entered the wrong docket number on her notice of appeal and appeal bond; given that the notice indicated the date of the judgment she was appealing, the incorrect docket number was merely a technical error. Johnson v. Ragsdale, 158 S.W.3d 426, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 432 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2005).

   Circuit court properly dismissed defendant's appeal and affirmed the judgment of the general sessions court pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-107" target="_self">27-5-107</a></cite> because to preserve plaintiff's original cause of action after dismissal, plaintiff had to perfect an appeal to the circuit court as prescribed by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-108" target="_self">27-5-108</a></cite>, but plaintiff did not appeal the judgment, and his cause of action proceeded to the circuit court only by virtue of defendant's appeal; while defendant's appeal was pending, plaintiff was free to amend his complaint pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.16.html#t16c15s16-15-729" target="_blank">16-15-729</a></cite>, however, defendant could dismiss the appeal without the consent and over the objection of plaintiff, and the dismissal of defendant's appeal removed the case from the circuit court and was fatal to plaintiff's amended cause of action. Crowley v. Thomas, 343 S.W.3d 32, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 599 (Tenn. June 17, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case stemming from property damage, a trial court did not err by allowing a property owner to dismiss the lawsuit following an appeal by an adjacent landowner from a general sessions court judgment in favor of the property owner; a voluntary nonsuit was permitted at any time before the trial of a cause, and there was no authority holding that the party not filing an appeal from general sessions court was not allowed to nonsuit the action in circuit court. An argument that it was unfair to allow the owner to nonsuit the action and then potentially refile his claim in circuit court, seeking a larger amount of damages, because he did not appeal the general sessions judgment was rejected under the savings statute. Layman v. Acor, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 46 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 450 (Tenn. June 23, 2016).

       Petition for a writ of certiorari to vacate a probation revocation by the general sessions court, which was sought one year after the revocation, was properly denied because the petitioner failed to offer an excuse why an appeal of the revocation was not timely filed.

   In cases to establish paternity brought under the bastardy statute, the circuit court had no jurisdiction unless the defendant timely demanded a jury trial under §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c02s36-2-106" target="_blank">36-2-106</a></cite> [Repealed], and the exclusive method of appellate review was that provided by §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c02s36-2-114" target="_blank">36-2-114</a></cite> [Repealed] which was to the Court of Appeals.

      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature never intended to make the juvenile court a general sessions court; the intention was to transfer jurisdiction of the juvenile court to the general sessions court and to make the general sessions court a juvenile court when the subject matter before the court was within the jurisdiction conferred upon juvenile courts. Thus, the laws dealing with appeals from the general sessions court when that court is exercising nonjuvenile court jurisdiction were not controlling in an action to establish paternity; the controlling laws were the appellate procedures provided for juvenile courts. State ex rel. Winberry v. Brooks, 670 S.W.2d 631, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2752 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

       Following the expiration of the automatic stay of the chancery court's April 16, 2017 judgment, appellant failed to obtain a stay pending appeal and thus the judgment became enforceable on May 15, 2017 and remained enforceable when appellee sought to enforce the judgment by filing a detainer summons in the general sessions court and when appellant appealed to the circuit court. The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate this detainer action. Bottorff v. Sears, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 259 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 23, 2019).

The parties should be permitted to file amended pleadings to the fullest extent permitted by Tenn. R. Civ.

   Trial court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain a driver's de novo appeal because: (1) The driver's argument that a general sessions court's judgment was adverse to him because his medical bills alone dwarfed the amount awarded by the general sessions court was completely irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue; and (2) The judgment of the general sessions court was not “adverse” to the driver within the meaning of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c05s27-5-108ol1a1" target="_self">27-5-108(a)(1)</a></cite> because the court awarded the driver everything he requested since the driver's civil warrant requested an award of damages under $15,000.

       Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59, 60 are applicable to de novo appeals from general sessions court to circuit court; as in any other circuit court case, these rules reflect the circuit courts'  jurisdiction to correct earlier orders, even after an erroneous remand to general sessions court, within the parameters set out in those rules.

       Dismissal of a parent's untimely appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the parent failed to file an appeal within ten days of the general sessions court's order of protection, as required by statute, was appropriate because the writ of error which the parent filed after the expiration of the time limit was no longer a viable method of appeal in the State of Tennessee. Furthermore, statutes providing for a period of more than ten days to file an appeal were not applicable to the matter. New v. Dumitrache, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. June 29, 2020).

       Notice of appeal should sufficiently describe or specify the judgment or order appealed from, but a mistake in designating the judgment appealed from is not fatal, so long as the intent to appeal from a specific ruling can fairly be inferred and so long as the other party is not misled or prejudiced.

       Notice of appeal is sufficient if, although defective, the notice adequately describes or identifies the judgment or order, and appellee is not misled, in which case the court will disregard mere clerical errors, surplusage, and other mistakes.

      <p>
       With the promulgation of T.R.A.P. 3(d) the supreme court announced the abolition of the writ of error as an appellate procedure; this chapter, as far as it is in conflict with this rule, is effectively repealed, and appellate review by petition for a writ of error no longer exists. Haynes v. McKenzie Memorial Hospital, 667 S.W.2d 497, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3274 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

      <p>
       Dismissal of a parent's untimely appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the parent failed to file an appeal within ten days of the general sessions court's order of protection, as required by statute, was appropriate because the writ of error which the parent filed after the expiration of the time limit was no longer a viable method of appeal in the State of Tennessee. Furthermore, statutes providing for a period of more than ten days to file an appeal were not applicable to the matter. New v. Dumitrache, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. June 29, 2020).

       A writ of error has no place in the law unless there has been an original suit. It is a suit on the record in the original case and a continuance thereof. Fitzsimmons v. Johnson, 90 Tenn. 416, 17 S.W. 100, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1891); Atlanta Guano Co. v. Phipps, 41 S.W. 1087, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 25 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       A writ of error is rather a continuation of the original suit, and is not a new suit in the sense of the service of process. Fitzsimmons v. Johnson, 90 Tenn. 416, 17 S.W. 100, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1891); Duke v. Helms, 100 Tenn. 249, 46 S.W. 761, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 108 (1898); Tipton v. Tipton, 118 Tenn. 691, 104 S.W. 237, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 71 (1907).

   This section and §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c06s27-6-103" target="_self">27-6-103</a></cite> regulate the procedure upon appeal to the circuit or chancery court. In re Fox Estate, 161 Tenn. 432, 33 S.W.2d 82, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a writ of error is in most respects the continuation of an old case, it also partakes of the nature of a new suit, in that it is a proceeding begun with notice issuing out of the reviewing court. The party against whom it is sought must not be deprived of the right to show that petitioner is not entitled to the writ by reason of waiver or estoppel. Love Hardware Co. v. Connatser, 27 Tenn. App. 302, 180 S.W.2d 129, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 143 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).

Turner v. South Pittsburg Lumber & Coal Co., 14 Tenn. App. 297, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 39 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931); Crowe v. Birmingham & N. W. R. Co., 156 Tenn. 349, 1 S.W.2d 781, 1927 Tenn.

       While prayer for appeal and order allowing same is necessary to perfect appeal where record on file in Supreme Court contains a bond for costs the case would be treated as in the Supreme Court on a writ of error. Chumbley v. Duck River Electric Membership Corp., 203 Tenn. 243, 310 S.W.2d 453, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 296 (1958).

      <p>
       Where a certified copy of the record is on file in the Court of Appeals, and it contains a proper pauper's oath, it is incumbent on the court to treat the case as before it on a writ of error. Sanders v. Loyd, 51 Tenn. App. 49, 364 S.W.2d 369, 1960 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1960), superseded by statute as stated in, Calhoun v. State, — S.W.2d —, 1994 Tenn. Crim.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where an appeal or an appeal in nature of a writ of error is not perfected because of failure to file an appeal bond in due time, a writ of error lies as a matter of right. Ward v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where appeal was dismissed for failure to file bond, Court of Appeals would not affirm judgment upon such dismissal but would dismiss without prejudice to right to apply for writ of error. City of Paris v. Browning, 55 Tenn. App. 92, 396 S.W.2d 367, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 243 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).

       A writ of error is in the nature of a new suit, and may be obtained, as of right, by any person entitled to it, exactly as he may sue out a summons in an ordinary action upon compliance with the prescribed requirements, without notice of the application, if done within the time prescribed by law for its issuance. Mowry v. Davenport, 74 Tenn. 80, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 213 (1880); Ridgely v. Bennett, 81 Tenn. 206, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1884).

      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of error lies only from a final judgment or decree, where an appeal would have lain, as a matter of right; it does not lie either in a civil or criminal case, except from a final judgment. Hume v. Commercial Bank of Knoxville, 69 Tenn. 220, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1878); Beasley v. Ferriss, 69 Tenn. 461, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1878); Brewer v. State, 74 Tenn. 198, 1880 Tenn.

       In suit for possession of real estate, where court granted complainants a decree and ordered a writ to put complainant in possession, such decree was final, though matters in nature balancing rents, taxes, and improvements remained for separate adjustment. Rawley v. Burris, 47 S.W. 176, 1898 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 37 (1898).

       Writ of error will not lie where decree shows on its face that the cause was retained in lower court for further proceedings. Cockrill v. Peoples Sav. Bank, 155 Tenn. 342, 293 S.W. 996, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1927).

       Writ of error from a chancery decree takes up the whole cause, so far that compensation as agent, denied below to the defendant, will be awarded him in the appellate court against the complainant, his principal, who sought a recovery and account in the matter of the agency. Wood v. Cooper, 49 Tenn. 441, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 31 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of error brings the whole record, including a petition for writ of error coram nobis, and the proceedings thereon, and all errors will be examined into, and corrected by that court, either in the record before the writ of error coram nobis was sued out, or afterwards. Carney v. John McDonald Co., 1 Shannon's Cases 235 (1872).

      <p>
       Where appellants, upon oral argument, asked for a writ of error if their appeal was invalid for any reason, the appeal was broad enough to bring up the judgment for review, as well as the order overruling motion for new trial.

       Dismissal of a parent's untimely appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the parent failed to file an appeal within ten days of the general sessions court's order of protection, as required by statute, was appropriate because the writ of error which the parent filed after the expiration of the time limit was no longer a viable method of appeal in the State of Tennessee.

       At common law, the writ of error coram nobis was exclusively confined to proceedings in law courts, and was of very limited application. Almost the only errors mentioned in the books as being subject to correction in this mode are that the defendant in the original suit, being under age, appeared by attorney; that a feme plaintiff or defendant was under the disability of coverture when the action was commenced; and that the plaintiff or defendant died before verdict or interlocutory judgment.

       A suit for writ of error coram nobis is a new action to vacate and annul a judgment rather than an action to review the judgment. Moore v. Moore, 222 Tenn. 1, 431 S.W.2d 754, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 405 (1968).

       If a judgment be erroneous in matter of fact only, and not in matter of law, it may be reversed in the same court by writ of error coram nobis, for error in fact is not the error of the judges, and reversing it is not reversing their own judgment. Crawford v. Williams, 31 Tenn. 341, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1851); Bigham v. Brewer, 36 Tenn. 432, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1856); W. D. Dunnivant & Co. v. Miller, 60 Tenn. 227, 1872 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       The error in fact, which will render a judgment erroneous and authorize the writ to correct it, must be such as would have precluded or prevented the rendition of such judgment, if the fact had judicially appeared at the former trial, as where the plaintiff or defendant was under some legal disability, at the institution of the suit, or where either party had died before the verdict or interlocutory judgment. Crawford v. Williams, 31 Tenn. 341, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1851); Bigham v. Brewer, 36 Tenn. 432, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1856); Tibbs v. Anderson, 1 Shan. 189 (1866); Patterson v.

       The writ lies for errors of fact only, which are not the errors of the judges. Jones & Co. v. Pearce, Park & Co., 59 Tenn. 281, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1873).

       In the proceeding under writ of error coram nobis, nothing can be assigned for error in fact which appeared and was adjudged in the former suit, or which contradicts the record of that suit.

      The relief embraced in this chapter is confined to errors of fact occurring in proceedings of which the person seeking relief has had no notice, or which such person was prevented by disability from showing or correcting, or where a defense was prevented by surprise, accident, mistake, or fraud, without fault on such person's part. Thus, infancy at the rendition of the judgment, not appearing on the record sought to be corrected, or a real defense to an action by motion, of which the party aggrieved had no notice, and so of like cases, are good grounds for relief under this writ.

       The petition for writ to be released from a judgment on an injunction bond should allege want of notice, disability, surprise, accident, or fraud, whereby the petitioner was prevented from making defense; but objection for want of such requisites must be taken to dismiss the petition or writ, or the objection will be waived.

       A petition for a writ which shows that the appellant from a justice of the peace (now general sessions judge) did not have the case docketed, and did not prosecute his appeal diligently, but relied on the statement of the clerk that it would not be tried at that term does not show any such error of fact as would have prevented the rendition of the judgment had it appeared on the trial. Mahalovitch v. Vaughn, 60 Tenn. 325, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 501 (1873); Jackson v. Milsom, 74 Tenn. 514, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 285 (1880); Dinsmore v. Boyd, 74 Tenn. 689, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 199 (1881).

       From the judgment dismissing the petition or writ, the petitioner may appeal in error, and, at the same time, he may, by writ of error, take up the original cause, if the time for doing so has not expired, and have the questions involved in both aspects passed upon together in the appellate court.

       In cases where judgments are authorized by law to be rendered on bonds without notice, the writ is the proper remedy to annul or reverse such a judgment so rendered, where error of fact shown is sufficient to justify it, as where the bond was not executed by the petitioner against whom the judgment was rendered, but his name was signed thereto by some one without authority, for, while the rule is that bonds as records cannot be averred against, this rule is not applicable where the records are made through mistake, or bonds of record are forged.

       Where an order was made continuing all litigated civil cases, any step taken in such a litigated case, at that term, and in the absence of a party, would be irregular and erroneous, and ground for writ of error coram nobis. Whether the case was a litigated one is a question of fact, and brings the case within the class of errors in fact. If the case had been continued by name, it would be error apparent on the record, and could only be reached by writ of error to the Supreme Court. Crouch v. Mullinix, 48 Tenn. 478, 1870 Tenn.

Thruston v. Belotte, 59 Tenn. 249, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1873); Dinsmore v. Boyd, 74 Tenn. 689, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 199 (1881).

Crawford v. Williams, 31 Tenn. 341, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1851); Patterson v. Arnold, 44 Tenn. 364, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1867).

      <p>
       The relief obtainable by writ of error coram nobis in a criminal case is confined to errors outside the record and matters which were not and could not have been litigated on trial of the case, or on a motion for a new trial, or appeal in the nature of a writ of error, or a writ of error or a habeas corpus proceeding. Johnson v. Russell, 218 Tenn. 443, 404 S.W.2d 471, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 581 (1966), superseded by statute as stated in, State v. Mixon, 983 S.W.2d 661, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (Tenn. 1999).

       Where publication is necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and the record does not show that publication was made, it was an error of law and not of fact, arising upon the record, which cannot be corrected by the writ of error coram nobis, but by writ of error or appeal. Patterson v. Arnold, 44 Tenn. 364, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1867).

       Where the defendant abandoned his defense, upon the ground that no declaration was filed, and the papers could not be found, he will not be entitled to the writ to annul the final judgment afterwards taken against him by default, upon a declaration subsequently filed. He should have taken judgment by default against the plaintiff, and had his suit dismissed, because no declaration was filed. Brandon v. Diggs, 48 Tenn. 472, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1870); Mahalovitch v. Vaughn, 60 Tenn. 325, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 501 (1873); Thruston v. Belotte, 59 Tenn. 249, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1873).

      <p>
       The writ does not lie to annul or reverse a judgment, rendered by motion and without notice, upon a replevy bond, upon the error assigned that the judgment was not authorized by law, for the reason that the bond constitutes a part of the record, and if there be any error, it is one of law clearly arising upon the record then before the court. Upton v. Philips, 58 Tenn. 215, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 249 (1872); Dinsmore v. Boyd, 74 Tenn. 689, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 199 (1881).

       Where the defendant was under the full impression that he had retained, as counsel to defend the suit, an attorney who was in fact the counsel of the plaintiff, there not appearing to be any negligence or fault on the part of either client or attorney, and judgment by default and judgment final were rendered against the defendant, before he discovered his mistake, he was entitled to relief by the writ where he had a good defense.

       The discovery after the trial that the plaintiff had before the trial received from some of the defendants compensation in lieu and in satisfaction of his damages, and which was not known to the other defendants in time to plead accord and satisfaction, is not such error of fact as will authorize the writ of error coram nobis.

       The intent of this section was evidently to limit the right to proceed thereunder to one year from the time when the matters complained of in the petition for review had been considered and adjudicated, having in mind that such proceedings should be brought before such a lapse of time as would make it unlikely that witnesses could be reproduced and the facts correctly reviewed.

   Trial court did not err in finding that a petition for writ of error coram nobis was time-barred, because based on the record it was clear that the petition was filed several years after the statute of limitations had expired, and it was also clear that the state had raised the untimeliness of the petition in its motion in opposition to the petition. State v. Mann, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 6, 2007), cert. denied, Mann v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">171 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 773, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 2480</cite>, <cite class="us_code">553 U.S. 1057</cite>, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 4163 (U.S. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Regardless of the untimeliness of the petition, petitioner failed to present newly discovered evidence that might have resulted in a different judgment had it been presented at trial, because his claim that his co-counsel operated under a conflict of interest during his trial was not cognizable in a petition for writ of error coram nobis; petitioner's allegation, if proved, would have constituted ineffective assistance of counsel which the writ of error coram nobis was not designed to remedy, and furthermore petitioner's claim, if proved, did not exonerate him of guilt in the first degree murder case. State v. Mann, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 6, 2007), cert. denied, Mann v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">171 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 773, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 2480</cite>, <cite class="us_code">553 U.S. 1057</cite>, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 4163 (U.S. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a murder case, the denial of defendant's request for writ of error coram nobis was remanded for a hearing to determine whether the statute of limitations should be tolled, because if what a witness stated was true, the timeline presented by the state at trial would be called into question; according to the state's timeline at trial, defendant would have been helping the witness with her car trouble at the same time he would have been transporting the victim's body, but the witness stated that she saw inside both defendant's trunk and car and did not see a body, which was information that was both favorable and material. Harris v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 901 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 3, 2007), rev'd, 301 S.W.3d 141, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Jan. 14, 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis was barred by the statute of limitations because the time within which petitioner filed his petition for coram nobis relief exceeded the reasonable opportunity afforded by due process. The delay of nearly five years was unreasonable. Thomas v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 131 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 23, 2011), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 773 (Tenn. Aug. 25, 2011), cert. denied, Thomas v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">565 U.S. 1245</cite>, <cite class="s_court">132 S. Ct. 1713</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">182 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 252, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 1846 (U.S. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's petition for a writ of error coram nobis was properly dismissed because it was filed well outside the applicable one-year statute of limitations where defendant offered no real reason for not discovering a potential witness sooner, even had the witness been known and produced at trial, the witness testified that he was not coherent at the time, and the record did not support a finding that the witness's testimony would have actually contradicted any of the overwhelming evidence presented at the trial. Haneline v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 225 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 31, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 535 (Tenn. June 15, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner's application for a writ of error coram nobis was properly dismissed because it was filed beyond the statute of limitations; the statute of limitations defense was not waived because petitioner was aware of the statute of limitations issue, and he made allegations in a presumptive attempt to rebut it as a defense. Jefferson v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 332 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 6, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 657 (Tenn. Aug. 14, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process did not require tolling the statute of limitations because petitioner offered no explanation for the delay in filing his petition. Jefferson v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 332 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 6, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 657 (Tenn. Aug. 14, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment was entered on July 24, 2002, and the statute of limitations would have begun to run 30 days later on August 23, 2002, such that the one-year statute of limitations expired on August 23, 2003. King v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 869 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 23, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>

   Coram nobis court applied the proper standard under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c07s27-7-103" target="_self">27-7-103</a></cite> in denying the petition; although the coram nobis court used the “would have” standard, this did not necessarily signify the application of an incorrect legal standard, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the coram nobis court applied the “may have” standard. Miller v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 17, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 631 (Tenn. Sept. 21, 2017).

       The writ of error coram nobis is a new suit to reverse or amend a former judgment, and is not commenced by the mere granting of the fiat for its issuance, for the petition must be filed with the clerk of the court and the terms of the fiat complied with by the execution of the bond required by law or the fiat of the judge, in order to commence such suit all within the time.

       The petition for a writ of error coram nobis and supersedeas may be amended on good cause shown, although leave to amend should be very guardedly awarded. Baxter v. Grandstaff, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 244 (1876).

      <p>
       The petition for the writ and supersedeas to annul a judgment taken upon motion and without notice against a sheriff and his sureties, for the nonreturn of an execution, may be amended on good cause shown, but where the judgment was in favor of the clerk, as an officer of the court, and for the benefit of suitors, the amended petition, if based upon information and belief should, as a matter of precaution, be sustained by the affidavits of persons having actual knowledge of the facts.

       The petition for the writ of error coram nobis must be sworn to; and if the affidavit is made by one styling himself agent for the petitioner, it must appear in the affidavit or petition that the facts relied on are peculiarly within the knowledge of such agent, or good cause must be shown for the employment of an agent.

   Prisoner's petition for coram nobis relief was barred by a one-year statute of limitations because the prisoner's claim that the prisoner was ineligible for the death penalty, as the prisoner was intellectually disabled, could have been litigated at trial or during post-conviction proceedings. Therefore, the grounds were not later-arising, justifying the tolling of the statute of limitations. Chalmers v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 664 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 30, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 956 (Tenn. Nov. 19, 2014), cert. denied, Chalmers v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">193 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       In petitioner's death penalty case, the petition for writ of error coram nobis was barred by the one-year statute of limitations because, when petitioner filed his motion to reopen in April 2012, he chose not to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis alleging that he was intellectually disabled; additionally, an expert's affidavit claimed no new test results nor information that could not have been known or discovered in 1987. Payne v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1005 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 30, 2014), aff'd, 493 S.W.3d 478, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 265 (Tenn. Apr. 7, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Coram nobis court properly granted defense counsel's motion to withdraw and the State's motion to dismiss defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis as untimely because defendant had an opportunity to present his claims in a meaningful time and a meaningful manner, there was no showing that the claimed grounds for relief arose after the statute of limitations began to run, defendant did not allege grounds that, if true, would entitle him to coram nobis relief, and the coram nobis court was not required to appoint a successor counsel to respond to the State's motion or to conduct a hearing to determine whether due process should toll the statute of limitations. Taylor v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 178 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 16, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant was not entitled to coram nobis relief because defendant's claim regarding new Tennessee Department of Human Services and police records pertaining to inconsistent accounts by the child molestation victim was time-barred in that defendant waited an unreasonable amount of time after receipt of the records to file the petition. Regardless, there was no reasonable basis for concluding that the results might have been different had the newly discovered records been presented at defendant's trial. Duke v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 925 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 23, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 292 (Tenn. Apr. 6, 2016), cert. denied, Duke v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">196 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 305, <cite class="s_court">137 S. Ct. 387</cite>, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 6692.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Even if the allegedly new medical expert evidence of a doctor's opinion was later-arising, it was barred by the statute of limitations because, assuming, arguendo, that defendant could not have discovered with due diligence the new medical expert opinion evidence earlier, defendant could at least have raised it when defendant first received the doctor's opinion. Duke v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 925 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 23, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 292 (Tenn. Apr. 6, 2016), cert. denied, Duke v.

      <p>
       Waiting over 10 years to obtain an affidavit from an allegedly recanting witness, after having been granted a full hearing on a previous petition asserting the same ground for relief, exceeded the reasonable opportunity to present a claim; petitioner was not entitled to an additional evidentiary hearing, and the fact that she unsuccessfully attempted to obtain relief through post-conviction proceedings did not further toll the statute of limitations, and the denial of her second petition for coram nobis was affirmed. Barnett v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 765 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 23, 2015), review denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Jan. 21, 2016).

       Defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis, seeking a new trial based on the fact that the forensic medical examiner (ME) who testified at his trial had his medical license revoked in 2005 due to intentional misdeeds, was properly dismissed because defendant did not allege any specific findings of incorrect, incompetent, or intentionally deceitful testimony by the ME during his trial; defendant's petition was not filed until December 2013, almost 23 years after the statute of limitations had expired; and defendant waited more than two years after he learned of the ME's conduct before filing the petition. Woods v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 835 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 15, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the state of the record, which did not include certain appendices, the court was unable to examine the alleged newly discovered evidence in order to determine whether petitioner's grounds for relief actually arose after the expiration of the statute of limitations, and thus it had to be presumed that the decision of the trial court finding that the evidence was not later-arising was correct; because the petition was filed well beyond the statute of limitations period and no due process concerns precluded application of the limitations period, petitioner was not entitled to relief. King v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 869 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 23, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate's petition for writ of error coram nobis was time-barred because (1) the petition was not filed within one year of the trial court's final judgment, and (2) due process did not require tolling, as an expert could testify before the limitations period expired, and a failure to call the expert at trial was not explained, so the evidence the petition was based on did not arise after the limitations period began. Moore v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 902 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 6, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 369 (Tenn. May 9, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus, if treated as a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, was filed after the one-year statutory limitations had expired, and defendant did not allege anything that would have tolled the limitations period. Howard v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 968 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 4, 2015), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 217 (Tenn. Mar. 23, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary dismissal of defendant's petition for a writ of error coram nobis was appropriate because the petition was time barred, as it was filed well beyond the one-year statute of limitations, and due process considerations did not require a tolling of the statute of limitations, as the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. Barnes v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 96 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 10, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute of limitations expired more than a year and a half before defendant filed a pro se petition for writ of error coram nobis. Furthermore, because defendant raised the issue of the statute of limitations in the petition and in appellate briefs, defendant could not argue that defendant was prejudiced by failing to receive fair notice of this defense or by not having an opportunity to rebut this defense when the coram nobis court summarily dismissed the petition. Willis v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 488 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 7, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner's coram nobis claim regarding the discovery of an unedited videotape was time-barred because the petitioner's conviction became final upon the judgment of conviction in the trial court. However, reversal of the judgment as to a claim regarding lab bench notes and remand for a hearing on whether due process required tolling the statute of limitations on the claim was appropriate as the appellate court was unable to determine whether the ground for relief actually arose after the limitations period commenced. Cauthern v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 223 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 24, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's claims regarding the victim's having lied at trial and having been threatened regarding the victim's trial testimony were barred by the statute of limitations because those issues were raised at defendant's trial and motion for new trial, and the victim was cross-examined at trial about having recanted the victim's allegations against defendant. Defendant's claim of witnessing another person rape the victim was also time-barred because the victim testified at trial that the other person had also touched the victim. Cradic v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 441 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 26, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 691 (Tenn. Oct. 4, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       State of Tennessee's statute of limitations argument was without merit under the law of the case doctrine because the State did not file a petition to rehear in the first appeal concerning the intermediate appellate court's determination that the statute of limitations issue could not be considered, nor did the State seek review by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. State v. Lowery, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 633 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 19, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 798 (Tenn. Nov. 16, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Coram nobis petition was untimely, having been filed nearly two decades after the one-year limitations period. Keen v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 710 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 11, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 896 (Tenn. Dec. 11, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgments became final on April 12, 2012 and thus petitioner had until April 12, 2013 to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis; however, petitioner did not file until 2017, well outside the one-year statute of limitations, and as petitioner's grounds for relief were not later-arising and he conceded that he was aware that the jury had viewed the forensic interviews in question during its deliberations as early as 2011, due process does not require tolling of the statute of limitations. Guilfoy v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 531 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 17, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 725 (Tenn. Nov. 14, 2018).

       Petition for writ of error coram nobis was untimely because it was not filed until three years after the judgment became final. Mosley v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 924 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 28, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the petition for writ of error coram nobis was untimely filed and because tolling of the statute of limitations was not required given the inmate's failure to sufficiency explain why he was entitled to equitable tolling, the coram nobis court did not err in denying the petition. Arnold v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 72 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 5, 2020).

       Petition challenging validity of criminal conviction which was not filed within one year of rendition of judgment was properly treated as a petition for habeas corpus rather than for writ of error coram nobis. Johnson v. Russell, 218 Tenn. 443, 404 S.W.2d 471, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 581 (1966), superseded by statute as stated in, State v. Mixon, 983 S.W.2d 661, 1999 Tenn.

   A coram nobis petition was time barred where, even though the state did not specifically cite this section in its motion to dismiss, the fact that it did cite §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c30s40-30-102" target="_blank">40-30-102</a></cite> — the statute of limitations applicable to post-conviction claims — was sufficient to give notice that it intended to rely on a statute of limitations. Sands v. State, 903 S.W.2d 297, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 331 (Tenn. 1995), overruled in part, Nunley v. State, 552 S.W.3d 800, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 382 (Tenn. July 19, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due process precluded summary dismissal of a writ of coram nobis petition that was filed 14 days after the statute of limitations expired since a full evaluation of defendant's claim of recanted evidence outweighed the governmental interest in the statute of limitations.

       Inmate's allegations of newly discovered exculpatory evidence that was suppressed by the state, that the accomplice told another person that he was the sole shooter, could not have been litigated previously and raised serious questions regarding whether the inmate, in fact, murdered the victim. Thus, due process precluded summary dismissal of her claim based upon a statutory time bar and she was entitled to a hearing to evaluate the claims contained in her petition for writ of error coram nobis relating to the newly discovered evidence; at the hearing, the inmate would have the opportunity to establish that there was a “reasonable probability” that the newly discovered evidence might have resulted in a different judgment if the evidence had been admitted at the previous trial and, if she made that showing and she established that she “was without fault” in failing to present the newly discovered evidence at the appropriate time, she would be entitled to a new trial.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that the inmate escaped from jail and remained a fugitive for many years did not change the fact that the exculpatory evidence was withheld by the state and, even if the inmate had not escaped, there was no reason to believe the exculpatory evidence would have been disclosed voluntarily. Thus, due process precluded the summary dismissal of the inmate's claim based upon a statutory time bar and she was entitled to a hearing to evaluate the claims contained in her petition for writ of error coram nobis relating to the newly discovered evidence.

   Defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis was filed well outside the one-year statute of limitations, as it was filed over four years after the appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions on direct appeal; defendant failed to advance any ground for which the statute of limitations should be tolled, such that the trial court properly dismissed the petition as time-barred.

       In a first degree premeditated murder case, a petition for a writ of error coram nobis was properly dismissed as untimely; the one-year statute of limitations for such proceedings was not tolled based on newly discovered evidence because petitioner knew at the time of trial about statements he made to police. At a hearing, trial counsel testified that he knew of the statement that petitioner made on the night of his arrest and possessed a copy of that statement; moreover, trial counsel stated that both petitioner and his wife testified at trial about the victim's assault on petitioner.

   In a case in which an inmate claimed that he was ineligible for the death penalty because he was intellectually disabled and that his murder conviction violated principles of double jeopardy, the court of criminal appeals concluded that the inmate's petition for a writ of error coram nobis was barred by the one-year statute of limitations provided in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c07s27-7-103" target="_self">27-7-103</a></cite>, and that due process did not require tolling of the statute of limitations.

       Petitioner, who appealed the dismissal of his petition for a writ of error coram nobis which alleged newly discovered evidence, failed to meet his burden of proving that due process required tolling of the one-year statute of limitations. Petitioner's claim of newly discovered evidence did not constitute a “later-arising” claim because the evidence at issue existed long before petitioner's trial, and there was no evidence presented that the exercise of reasonable diligence would not have led to a timely discovery of the new information.

       Because the convictions that mandated defendant's compliance with the sexual offender registry were not evidence of actual innocence that would have changed the course of trial, the trial court found that the statute of limitation for the writ of error coram nobis should not be tolled.

       Because the Tennessee Sexual Offender and Violent Sexual Offender Registration, Verification, and Tracking Act included defendant's convictions for aggravated kidnapping and especially aggravated kidnapping as sexual offenses since 2006, the issue regarding the requirement that defendant register as a sex offender did not arise after the limitations period, and the exercise of reasonable diligence would have led to a timely discovery of the requirement that he had to register as a sex offender, the statute of limitations for the writ of error coram nobis was not be tolled.

       Due process considerations did not toll the statute of limitations for either of the grounds raised by defendant in a pro se petition for coram nobis relief because the grounds for relief did not arise after the commencement of the limitations period as the State of Tennessee provided the purportedly, newly discovered notes in investigative files to defendant prior to the trial and defendant had tried to use the purportedly, newly discovered telephone recordings in an earlier motion to suppress.

       Writ was filed approximately 10 years after the limitations period had run, and due process did not require tolling because the linguistics expert's findings did not tend to show that a different verdict might have resulted if petitioner had testified with the assistance of an interpreter; petitioner's ability to speak English had been previously litigated and each time it was held that his English skills were sufficient not to require an interpreter.

       In a case in which petitioner appealed the summary dismissal of his petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the court of criminal appeals concluded that statements made by four witnesses did not establish petitioner's actual innocence and, therefore, did not require tolling of the one-year statute of limitations.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a petition for writ of error coram nobis without an evidentiary hearing because petitioner did not file his petition within the statute of limitations and due process concerns did not require tolling the statute of limitations, as the discovery of witness statements after making an open records request in 2017 did not arise after the limitations period. It appeared from the record that the information was made available to trial counsel before trial but strategically not used at trial. Skinner v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim.

There is no requirement that trial courts hold an evidentiary hearing prior to dismissing a coram nobis petition if the petition fails to meet the necessary prerequisites for granting coram nobis relief.

       If the coram nobis petition does not show on its face that it is filed within the one-year statute of limitations, the petition must set forth with particularity facts demonstrating that the prisoner is entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations: To be entitled to equitable tolling, a prisoner must demonstrate with particularity in the petition: (1) that the ground or grounds upon which the prisoner is seeking relief are later arising grounds, that is grounds that arose after the point in time when the applicable statute of limitations normally would have started to run; and (2) that, based on the facts of the case, the strict application of the statute of limitations would effectively deny the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to present his or her claims. A prisoner is not entitled to equitable tolling to pursue a patently non-meritorious ground for relief. Nunley v. State, 552 S.W.3d 800, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 382 (Tenn. July 19, 2018).

   Trial court did not err by dismissing defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis without an evidentiary hearing or appointment of counsel because the petition was insufficient on its face, as defendant failed to provide any evidence to substantiate his claim that the grand jury foreperson signed his indictment without being sworn in, his claim against his former attorney did not qualify as newly discovered evidence, and he failed to show how he was without fault in not discovering cell phone evidence sooner. In addition, defendant filed his petition more than seven years after the expiration of the statute of limitations and the petition failed to sufficiently explain why he was entitled to equitable tolling.

       Trial court properly denied defendant's petition for writ of error coram nobis because, while defendant was reasonably diligent in securing an affidavit and filing his petition for the writ within just a few months of a victim's conversation with a private investigator, the victim's recanted testimony was not likely to have changed the outcome of defendant's trial where the home invasion at issue took place over two decades ago and the majority of her hearing testimony was merely cumulative of her trial testimony.

Equitable tolling was not warranted because the petition was filed 17 months after discovering the alleged Brady material, and though petitioner was pursuing his Brady claims in federal court during the 17-month delay, it was well within his control to separately file a state petition for writ of error coram nobis while his federal habeas claims were pending but he failed to do so.

       Trial court did not err in tolling the statute of limitations because petitioner obtained alleged newly discovered evidence after the limitations period commenced, and petitioner filed his application for writ of error coram nobis less than one year after he gained access to the evidence; a strict application of the limitations period would effectively deny petitioner a reasonable opportunity to present his claim.

       Court of criminal appeals erred in reversing the trial court's order dismissing petitioner's application for a writ of error coram nobis because the assistant district attorney's handwritten note petitioner discovered was not newly discovered evidence on which a petition for writ of error coram nobis could be based; the handwritten note recording the assistant prosecutor's impressions as to the credibility of witnesses qualified as a memorandum prepared in anticipation of trial and constituted work product under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2), and thus, the note was neither discoverable nor admissible. Wilson v. State, 367 S.W.3d 229, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. Apr. 20, 2012), writ denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn.

       The assignment of errors should embrace the grounds of the application and the grounds of the defense (and the grounds of the defense are the grounds upon which the judgment should be annulled), and a general demurrer to the whole assignment will be sufficient to dismiss the writ, if the reasons assigned for the application are insufficient; and, a fortiori, if both reasons for the application and the errors assigned are insufficient.

      <p>
       Tennessee Const., art. VI, § 10 does not restrict the use of the common law writ of certiorari but serves as a guaranty of the continuance of a power which was already vested. Puckett v. Broome, 53 Tenn. App. 663, 385 S.W.2d 762, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the county and its officials had no right to question the legality of the state board of equalization, such a situation was intolerable, unreasonable and contrary to the intent of the Constitution and statutes. Polk County v. State Board of Equalization, 484 S.W.2d 49, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 344 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The procedural framework for review under both the common law and statutory writs appears in ch. 9 of this title. Fairhaven Corp. v. Tennessee Health Facilities Com., 566 S.W.2d 885, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 270 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petitioner is not justified in deciding for himself that the courts of Tennessee will deny him relief on his claim for procedural reasons, and before bringing any claim to federal court, the petitioner must be sure that he has first taken it to the state courts; that is the requirement of the vital exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine. Wright v. Trammell, 647 F. Supp. 1, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19942 (M.D. Tenn. 1985), aff'd, 802 F.2d 461, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 27817 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The writ of certiorari lies at common law to review and supervise the proceedings of inferior tribunals, but does not take the place of appeal or writ of error, and brings up the entire record to determine whether there has been an excess or absence of jurisdiction, or failure to proceed according to the essential requirements of the law. Clark v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, 827 S.W.2d 312, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 815 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Review under the common law writ is limited to whether the inferior board or tribunal (1) has exceeded its jurisdiction, or (2) has acted illegally, arbitrarily, or fraudulently. Citizens for Collierville v. Town of Collierville, 977 S.W.2d 321, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 97 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).

       Where general sessions judges revoked power of bail bondsmen and bondsmen in order to review such decision obtained certiorari from the circuit court and there was a difference of opinion as to whether permitting the giving of bonds was a ministerial or discretionary power of the court the Supreme Court on appeal considered it as having been brought to the circuit court by certiorari rather than by mandamus which would have been the proper remedy if the duty to permit bond had been ministerial.

      <p>
       The writ of certiorari lies at common law to review and supervise the proceedings of inferior tribunals by a superior tribunal, but does not take the place of appeal or writ of error, and brings up the entire record to determine whether there has been an absence or excess of jurisdiction, or failure to proceed according to the essential requirements of the law. Conners v. Knoxville, 136 Tenn. 428, 189 S.W. 870, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 147 (1916); State ex rel. McMorrough v. Hunt, 137 Tenn. 243, 192 S.W. 931, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1917); Jones v. State ex rel.

       The common law use of the writ of certiorari, was always to review proceedings of an inferior tribunal at an intermediate stage, and never to review a cause after final judgment. Bragg v. Boyd, 193 Tenn. 507, 246 S.W.2d 575, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 317 (1952).

      <p>
       If a writ of certiorari is issued exclusively under this section it is equivalent to a common law writ of certiorari and the hearing in the circuit court must be limited to the question whether or not the inferior tribunal, board or officer has exceeded the jurisdiction conferred or is acting illegally.

       “Certiorari” at common law performed the function of aid to a review and supervision of the proceedings of inferior boards and tribunals by a superior tribunal, not taking the place of appeal or writ of error, but bringing up the entire record in order to a determination whether there had been an absence or excess of jurisdiction, or a failure to proceed according to the essential requirements of the law.

       The common law writ of certiorari, as distinguished from the statutory writ, or certiorari in lieu of an appeal, does not lie for the correction of technical or formal errors, not affecting the jurisdiction or power, nor for the correction of defects that are not radical, or not amounting to an illegality that is fundamental, as distinguished from an irregularity.

       Common law writ is limited to an external examination of the validity of the proceedings of the inferior tribunal and does not review the judgment on the law or the facts, but such limitation will not affect the use of statutory certiorari in lieu of appeal where a party has been deprived of right to appeal without fault of his own.

       Certiorari cannot be resorted to as a substitute for appeal except when a case is made out in the petition showing that the appeal was defeated (1) by the oppressive or erroneous act of the court, (2) by the willful or negligent act of the clerk, (3) by the contrivance or procurement of the adverse party, (4) by inevitable accident, or (5) by the blameless misfortune of the petitioner.

       While the issuance of a writ of certiorari is a matter within the discretion of the court, and a writ may be refused which would otherwise be issued where substantial justice has been reached by an inferior tribunal, or where public inconvenience or confusion would follow the writ, yet, where the Supreme Court had found that one removed from the office of chief of police of a city was entitled to a certiorari to review the removal, the contention that the court in its discretion might decline to entertain the writ is foreclosed, according to the great weight of authority.

       While there is a statutory, procedural distinction between common law certiorari and declaratory judgment, there is no sound logic to maintain different standards of substantive review. Whether the action by the local governmental body is legislative or administrative in nature, the court should refrain from substituting its judgment for the broad discretionary authority of the local governmental body. An invalidation of the action should take place only when the decision is clearly illegal, arbitrary, or capricious. McCallen v. Memphis, 786 S.W.2d 633, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (Tenn. 1990).

       Defendant could not appeal as of right trial court's denial of her motion to modify a condition of probation, and the Tennessee court of criminal appeals erred in granting defendant common-law writ of certiorari and in holding that trial court's decision was a plain and palpable abuse of discretion; record did not reflect that trial court exceeded its jurisdiction or acted illegally, fraudulently, or arbitrarily in denying defendant's motion to modify. State v. Lane, 254 S.W.3d 349, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 365 (Tenn. May 20, 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because an inmate was not entitled to multiple release eligibility dates and consideration for custodial parole, his petition alleging that the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole and Board officials deprived him of the privilege to be heard for custodial parole failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted; therefore, the trial court properly granted the motions of the Board and officials to dismiss the inmate's petition for common law writ of certiorari pursuant to T.C.A. §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c08s27-8-101" target="_self">27-8-101</a></cite> and<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c09s27-9-101" target="_self">27-9-101</a></cite>. Stewart v. Schofield, 368 S.W.3d 457, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 376 (Tenn. May 25, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court properly dismissed an inmate's petition under T.C.A. §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c08s27-8-101" target="_self">27-8-101</a></cite> and<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c09s27-9-101" target="_self">27-9-101</a></cite> for common law writ of certiorari against the Tennessee Department of Correction's (TDOC) and TDOC officials because the inmate failed to seek a declaratory order from TDOC as required by the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.04.html#t04c05s4-5-225ol1b" target="_blank">4-5-225(b)</a></cite>; therefore, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the claims against TDOC and TDOC officials. Stewart v. Schofield, 368 S.W.3d 457, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 376 (Tenn. May 25, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court acted without legal authority, and there was no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy for the State, the court of criminal appeals treated the State's appeal as that of a writ of certiorari. State v. Morgan, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 746 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 29, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the State of Tennessee could not appeal its claim that the trial court erred by applying the amended version of a sentencing statute, appellate jurisdiction existed over the claim because, once defendant filed a notice of appeal, the court acquired jurisdiction of the entire case and any properly-preserved, cognizable claims. Because the determination of the appropriate version of the statute to be applied qualified as a question of law, it was permitted to be raised by either party, regardless of which party initiated the appeal. State v. Keese, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 193 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 15, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although no right of direct appeal lied for the State of Tennessee, because a trial court's application of an amended sentencing statute to defendant's case and the resulting modification of defendant's sentence exceeded the court's authority, the appellate court elected to treat the State of Tennessee's improperly-filed appeal as of right as a petition for the common law writ of certiorari and reviewed the matter. State v. Tolle, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 19, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals declined to treat the State's appeal as a common law writ of certiorari because the trial court did not exceed its jurisdiction or act illegally in sentencing defendant, the a sentencing hearing was held consistent with the laws and principles of sentencing, and both parties participated meaningfully in the hearing; the trial court's decision to sentence defendant pursuant to the amended statutory grading of theft statute was not a plain and palpable abuse of discretion. State v. Cross, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 335 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 3, 2018).

       Although the general rule is that the common law writ of certiorari should be restricted to those cases where an inferior tribunal has exceeded the jurisdiction conferred or is acting illegally and there is no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy, and that as a general proposition it does not lie to inquire into the correctness of the judgment where the court has jurisdiction, there are exceptions to the general rule which include, but are not restricted to, the following: (1) where the ruling of the court below represents a fundamental illegality; (2) where the ruling constitutes a failure to proceed according to the essential requirements of the law; (3) where the ruling is tantamount to the denial to either party of a day in court; (4) where the action of the trial judge was without legal authority; (5) where the action of the trial judge constituted a plain and palpable abuse of discretion; (6) where either party has lost a right or interest that may never be recaptured.

       Certiorari does not lie from order of circuit judge in requiring county trustee to give a new bond, where the proceeding is merely erroneous, but if the proceeding be such a departure from the provisions of the statute as to render it void, the remedy is by certiorari.

       Writs of certiorari and supersedeas would not lie from a judgment of the county court, upon notes given for the purchase of land sold for partition, in the place of an appeal, because the jurisdiction of the county court in such cases was concurrent with the chancery and circuit courts, and an appeal lies from it in such cases. A writ of error, or a writ of error coram nobis, would, perhaps, be the proper remedy, in the absence of an appeal. Swafford v. Howard, 67 Tenn. 326, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 383 (1874).

       It is a sufficient ground that the petitioner remained at the place of trial till late in the evening and then went home, and after sundown the warrant was returned and judgment was rendered, of which he was not informed till after the time for appealing had expired.

       Where notes were placed in the hands of a constable and were sued on, and no defense was known or apprehended, and the plaintiff was sick and failed to send an agent, the right to the certiorari instead of an appeal was not forfeited. McCormack v. Murfree, 34 Tenn. 46, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1854).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the justice (now general sessions judge) who rendered the judgment was absent from his county during the time for the appeal, and the petitioner went to his office during that time to take an appeal, such absence was a sufficient ground. King v. Williams, 54 Tenn. 303, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a ground for certiorari instead of an appeal where the plaintiff, residing in one county, sent to his agent in another county, in which the defendant resided, the written contract evidencing the debt to be sued on, the plaintiff anticipating no defense because the defendant had paid half the debt, and the agent was unable to procure sureties for the appeal from the judgment so unexpectedly rendered against the plaintiff, within the two days allowed by law, the plaintiff having not heard of the judgment until it was too late to furnish sureties for the appeal.

       Certiorari is available in the Court of Appeals where a trial court has denied an appeal to one entitled to appeal. Cummings v. Patterson, 54 Tenn. App. 75, 388 S.W.2d 157, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 147 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).

       The petition for certiorari instead of an appeal must show merits and a good cause for not appealing. Hale v. Landrum, 21 Tenn. 32, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1840); McCormack v. Murfree, 34 Tenn. 46, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1854); O'Sullivan v. Larry, 39 Tenn. 54, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 251 (1858); Hardin v. Williams, 52 Tenn. 385, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 273 (1871); Ammons v.

       In a petition for a certiorari instead of an appeal, certainty to “a common intent” in the averments is sufficient and all that is required. Dick & Co. v. Powell, 32 Tenn. 632, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1853); Hardin v. Williams, 52 Tenn. 385, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 273 (1871); Harris v. Gleghorn, 80 Tenn. 381, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition fails to show sufficient grounds therefor, unless the petitioner has been deprived of his appeal by inevitable accident, by the wrongful act of the justice or adverse party, or by his own blameless misfortune, no matter how meritorious his case may be, and a petition failing to show such grounds will be dismissed. Copeland v. Cox, 52 Tenn. 171, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (1871); Cox v. Kent, 68 Tenn. 492, 1876 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition that merely recited a history of the case, the amount sued for on sworn account, and the amount of the judgment entered by the trial justice court, and asserted as grounds for certiorari the conclusory statement that “mutual mistakes have been made” was insufficient to warrant issuance of a writ. Jasper Engine & Transmission Exch. v. Mills, 911 S.W.2d 719, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 254 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995), application denied, — S.W.2d —, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 488 (Tenn. Aug. 28, 1995).

       A petition by a surety on a note that the judgment is wholly unjust, and that he is informed and believes that he can show on another trial that the note sued on had been paid in whole or in part before the suit was brought, is a statement of “good and sufficient cause.” Hardin v.

       A petition for writs of certiorari and supersedeas in a replevin suit, stating that the property of the petitioner (the plaintiff in the replevin suit) was seized by one not an officer, but falsely claiming to be such, and to satisfy a claim against another person, shows merits.

       Amendment of petition for certiorari may be allowed in a proper case in the discretion of the court, but like amendments to answers in chancery, the amendment should be very guardedly allowed; but having been granted, and the amendment showing merits, it is error to dismiss the petition upon a motion made previous to the grant of leave to amend.

       General statements of petitioner's belief, on information, that the person serving the warrant was not an officer; that the note sued on was a forgery; that the petitioner lived in another county, and was hurrying home to a sick family when the warrant was served on him, and that it was impossible for him to return in time to appeal, and that neither party lived in the county where the suit was brought.

       Where the petition for the certiorari is dismissed as insufficient, the petitioner cannot resort to the writ of error coram nobis or any other law proceeding to avail himself of any errors of which he might have had the benefit upon his petition for certiorari, but of which he was deprived by his mere negligence. In a proper case, he might have relief in chancery. Welsh v. Harman, 16 Tenn. 103, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1835); Lindsley v. Thompson, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 272 (1873).

       An audita querela is where a defendant against whom a judgment is recovered and, who is therefore in danger of execution, or perhaps actually in execution, may be relieved upon good matter in discharge which has happened since the judgment, as where the plaintiff has given him a general release or where the defendant has paid the debt to the plaintiff without entering satisfaction on the record.

      <p>
       Where certiorari is used instead of the audita querela to quash an execution upon a matter of discharge subsequent to the judgment, or because the execution is void upon its face, the jurisdiction belongs to the circuit court of the county to which the certified execution was sent, and in which the execution issued upon such certified execution. Rogers v. Miller, 31 Tenn. 22, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1851); Saunders v. Russell, 78 Tenn. 293, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1882).

       A matter that has not arisen since the rendition of the judgment against which relief is sought is not a proper matter to be litigated upon a writ of audita querela or or certiorari in the nature of writ of audita querela.

       Office of certiorari and supersedeas, when used instead of the obsolete writ of audita querela, is to afford relief in relation to some matter of discharge, as release, payment, or discharge by bankruptcy or the statute of limitations, arising subsequent to the judgment.

       The certiorari will lie to quash a judgment for want of service of the summons, or to quash an execution based on a judgment barred by the statute of ten years, or to quash a levy wrongfully made. Ezell v. Holloway, 61 Tenn. 15, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 335 (1872); Sellars v. Fite, 62 Tenn. 120, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 152 (1873); McGrew v. Reasons, 71 Tenn. 485, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (1879); Cannon v.

       A justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment, regular upon its face, cannot be quashed by the circuit court as a void judgment, upon a proceeding by certiorari and supersedeas, instituted by the defendant for that purpose, and not for a new trial. The court cannot go behind the judgment and examine the evidence upon which the justice acted, though such evidence be the note sued on. Simmons v. Harris & Alexander, 66 Tenn. 325, 1874 Tenn.

       Trial court properly dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, the neighbors'  petition for writ of certiorari challenging a planning commission's decision because their motions to alter or amend were attempts to relitigate a matter that had already adjudicated, the trial court's final order of dismissal and subsequent order denying relief to the neighbors resolved all of the claims between the parties, and the neighbors'  petition for writ of certiorari did not comport with the statutory and constitutional requirements in order to vest the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction.

       Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review a decision of a board of zoning appeals forbidding landowners from hosting an off-road event because (1) the petition seeking review was not verified as required, and (2) the petition could not be treated as seeking declaratory relief, as the petition contested a quasi-judicial decision, and the relief sought was identical to the relief available in a petition for writ of certiorari.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where judgment in an unlawful detainer action in a justice of the peace (now general sessions) court had been rendered against the defendant, and he filed a petition for certiorari and supersedeas which was granted but the defendant failed to make the bond required by the court and these proceedings were dismissed whereon the circuit court without a jury properly allowed judgment against the defendant and his sureties for the amount of the ment in the justice of the peace court, plus the rents accruing during the ensuing litigation, plus the costs of the action. Robertson v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., 22 Tenn. App. 387, 123 S.W.2d 848, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where judgment was rendered against a debtor and execution issued with a levy upon an automobile of the debtor, the debtor claiming this automobile exempt under former §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.26.html#t26c02s26-2-101" target="_blank">26-2-101</a></cite> could properly attack the levy by means of certiorari and the execution of a supersedeas bond thus regaining possession of the car, however since the debtor in his petition for certiorari failed to alleged that he was head of a household and failed to allege that he had selected this automobile as exempt property prior to his petition, the petition was properly dismissed, whereon the court should render a new judgment against the debtor and his surety on the supersedeas bond for the amount of the old judgment plus costs. Keen v. Alexander, 195 Tenn. 564, 260 S.W.2d 297, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 380 (1953).

        7. —Judgment upon Quashing Execution in Part.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where an execution satisfied in part only has been superseded in toto, the court, after quashing the execution as to the satisfied part, will not remand and award precedendo as to the remainder, but will enter judgment upon the bond for supersedeas for such unsatisfied remainder. Thompson v. McMillan, 89 Tenn. 110, 14 S.W. 439, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1890).

       Denial of a motion to dismiss an action regarding a petition to hold a referendum was appropriate because the matter was not an election contest as the case did not involve allegations of illegal ballots or fraud. Furthermore, to require the petitioners to file a new lawsuit to litigate once again what had already been decided by the election commission and the circuit court, or to hold that the petitioners had failed to file such a lawsuit, would have been an injustice and not in the public interest.

   When an attorney sought review of the Board of Professional Responsibility's recommendation that he be suspended from the practice of law for six months, by means of a petition for writ of certiorari, the trial court properly dismissed his petition for his failure to file a complete transcript of the proceedings before the Board because: (1) Tenn.

       The railroad and public utilities commission issued certificates of convenience and necessity to permit the operation of truck lines, which action was affirmed by the circuit judge, and the appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals. It was held that the filing of a bill of exceptions was necessary, which might have been accomplished by an order of the trial judge directing that the original transcript before the railroad and public utilities commission should be sent up to the Court of Appeals as part of the record, but showing further affirmatively, that such transcript contained all the evidence heard in the cause in the circuit court. But a more fatal defect in the appeal was the failure to file and secure the action of the trial judge on a motion for a new trial, upon such grounds as, if overruled, would be the assignments of error in the Court of Appeals.

Upon written demand of the county or municipal employee the proceeding shall be heard by the judge or chancellor de novo with a trial by jury.

       Mandamus was a proper remedy to compel reinstatement of civil service employee of city who was discharged without a hearing, as common law certiorari was not applicable since there was no proceeding to review. State ex rel. Paylor v. Knoxville, 195 Tenn. 318, 259 S.W.2d 537, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1953).

       Where after issuance of writ of certiorari by circuit court for review of action of city Civil Service Commission in dismissing policeman and after commission's return to the writ, policeman moved for order for his reinstatement on ground that commission had failed to certify a full, true and complete record and transcript of the proceedings before the commission and motion was granted, such motion was equivalent to a demurrer on the ground of an insufficient return so that a motion for a new trial was unnecessary and Supreme Court could reverse and remand the cause for further proceedings where the error complained of was specifically called to the attention of the court by exception to order of court reinstating policeman. Lansden v. Tucker, 204 Tenn. 388, 321 S.W.2d 795, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 292 (1959).

       Where department head did not promptly file charges which were the basis of dismissal of employee with civil service commission as provided in metropolitan charter, mandamus directing department head to promptly file such charges and directing civil service commission to promptly hear and dispose of charges was justified but it was not proper for chancellor to take case away from civil service commission and order restoration of employee to former position without hearing before commission. State ex rel. Spence v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, 63 Tenn. App. 161, 469 S.W.2d 777, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 215 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971).

   Although the employer had proved a violation of the Memphis police department rule 104, the termination of the employee, a police officer, was inappropriate because, although the officer's conduct was inappropriate, the officer's conduct was not so egregious in itself as to have dictated termination; the civil service commission's decision reversed the employer's decision to terminate the employee and the commission's decision was supported by substantial and material evidence under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.04.html#t04c05s4-5-322ol1h" target="_blank">4-5-322(h)</a></cite> and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t27c09s27-9-114ol1b1" target="_self">27-9-114(b)(1)</a></cite>.

       Reversal of the termination of a county firefighter was appropriate because the county civil service merit board conceded that the hearing notice to the firefighter was deficient from a due process perspective as the board sought to uphold the firefighter's termination on different charges. To the extent that the board upheld the firefighter's termination on grounds other than the charges specifically identified, the termination ran afoul of the firefighter's due process rights. Moss v. Shelby Cty. Civ. Serv. Merit Bd., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 597 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 10, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly reversed a civil service commission's decision to reinstate a police officer where the commission and court identified the appropriate program provisions that applied to the disciplinary proceeding, the expert testimony supported a finding that the supplement the officer consumed was an immediate precursor to a controlled substance, the police officer tested positive for a controlled substance, and that positive drug test constituted a violation of the departmental policy that merited termination. Thus, the commission rendered an arbitrary and capricious decision by substituting its judgment for the rules and policies of the police department. Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 571 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2020).

       Under this section no court of record shall entertain any proceeding involving the civil service status of a county or city employee unless this official first exhausted his administrative appeal to the Civil Service Commission and there made a record, unless it would be futile to do so, and the fact that authorities will probably deny requested relief does not show futility.

       In proceedings in circuit court to review action of city Civil Service Commission in dismissing policeman, allegations in petition for certiorari that no testimony was offered that accused was guilty of any of the charges, and that the testimony failed in every particular and that the action of the commission was not warranted by the law and facts were sufficient to show that it was contemplated that the proceedings be one of common law certiorari.

       In proceedings in accordance with the rule of common law writ of certiorari as provided by this section the reviewing court may review the evidence solely for the purpose, and to the extent, of determining whether any of it that is material supports the action of the board or commission, and if the record contains such supporting evidence in the opinion of the reviewing court such court may not disturb the action of the board or commission.

      </p>
      <p>
       In review of action of city Civil Service Commission in dismissing policeman where commission's return to writ of certiorari did not contain a stenographic report of the evidence presented in the hearing before the commission but contained a summary of the testimony of witnesses, the summary of the testimony made it the duty of the circuit court to consider that testimony and to determine therefrom whether the commission acted arbitrarily, illegally or without material supporting evidence. Lansden v. Tucker, 204 Tenn. 388, 321 S.W.2d 795, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 292 (1959).

   The trial court does not weigh the evidence, and the scope of review by the appellate courts is no broader or more comprehensive than that of the trial court with respect to evidence presented before the board. Watts v. Civil Service Board, 606 S.W.2d 274, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 501 (Tenn. 1980), cert. denied, Watts v. Civil Service Bd., <cite class="us_code">450 U.S. 983</cite>, <cite class="s_court">101 S.

       Review of city council's decision to dismiss firefighter was restricted to consideration of whether lower tribunal acted arbitrarily, illegally or without material supporting evidence. Huddleston v. Murfreesboro, 635 S.W.2d 694, 1982 Tenn. LEXIS 423 (Tenn. 1982).

       In reviewing personnel board's dismissal of public employee, trial court can review evidence found in transcript solely for purpose of determining whether there is any material evidence to support action of board, in which case trial court may not disturb board's action.

       In a review of a matter under this section, neither the chancery court nor the court of appeals determines any disputed question of fact or weighs any evidence. Goodwin v. Metropolitan Bd. of Health, 656 S.W.2d 383, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 710 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).

   In upholding the termination of a police officer for unwarranted use of deadly force, city council was acting as “civil service board,” rather than as legislative body, and the standards set forth in §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.04.html#t04c05s4-5-322" target="_blank">4-5-322</a></cite> were properly applied in reviewing the decision of the council.

       Former assistant chief of police failed to provide either a factual or legal basis to undermine the chief of police's decision to utilize temporary assignment positions in his reorganization plan, as the chief's decision was approved by the director of human resources and the civil service commission. Miller v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, 271 S.W.3d 659, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 29 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2008), appeal denied, Miller v. Civil Serv.

      </p>
      <p>
       Record contained substantial and material evidence to support the civil service commission's conclusion that the reorganization of the police department complied with commission Rule 3.11 because the duties performed by the former assistant chiefs of police were not the same as the duties performed currently by the deputy chiefs of police; the reporting relationships were clearly different and the duties of the deputy chief of police for field operations were far broader than the duties and responsibilities of the former assistant chief of police for the west patrol bureau. Miller v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, 271 S.W.3d 659, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 29 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2008), appeal denied, Miller v. Civil Serv.

       Although a county civil service merit board was required to transmit its final decision as part of the administrative record, there was no question that the board rendered a final decision subject to appellate review, and that the lower court had before it all relevant information pertaining to that decision; the court of appeals therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, and the dispute, which was a narrow one of pure law, could be resolved without a remand.

       There was no basis for concluding that the sheriff's department could not inquire into the deputy jailer's expunged records and the jailer did not have the right to refrain from disclosing his expunged conviction in his response to sheriff's department lawful inquiry. The County Civil Service Merit Review Board's consideration of the jailer's admission of an expunged conviction was proper; accordingly, the trial court did not err in holding that the Board's decision was based on substantial and material evidence.

   Police officer's termination of employment was improper because the expert's testimony on which the Civil Service Commission relied was incongruent with the undisputed facts in the record; the facts in the record fairly detracted from the weight accorded by the Commission to the document examiner's opinion testimony.

       Although a police officer identified evidence that fairly detracted from the weight of the evidence supporting his termination, there was substantial evidence supporting a civil service commission's decision to fire him after a mental patient suffering from self-inflicted wounds died from a heart attack during a baton beating; a deputy chief testified that her review of the officer's entire disciplinary history and personnel file militated in favor of termination, and a training sergeant testified that officers were not taught to use a baton as a restraining device. The patient no longer had a knife, he did not directly confront the officers involving, and the patient was beaten and held down with batons after he tripped and was lying face down in the street.

       Chancery court erred in ruling that a civil service commission violated a statutory provision by failing to give an employee the benefit of the self-defense statute because that statute was not relevant to the commission's resolution of a factual dispute; the commission was fully apprised of the employee's claim that he acted in self-defense during an altercation and afforded more weight to the evidence supporting the victim's account of the altercation.

       Because a fire department employee never asserted that he was treated differently than other employees based on his membership in a suspect class, evidence that those employees were treated differently than he was treated was not material to his equal protection claim; it makes sense to consider evidence intended to show disparate treatment violating equal protection only insofar as it is based on discrimination against a suspect class.

       Civil service commission did not commit reversible error in excluding evidence of disparate treatment regarding other employees because the evidence was immaterial in the absence of an assertion that those employees were treated differently from an employee of the city fire department based on his membership in a suspect class.

       Civil service commission's decision to uphold an employee's termination was supported by substantial and material evidence because the employee's conduct during an altercation violated the disciplinary rules, and the city demonstrated that the disciplinary violations furnished a reasonable basis for terminating his employment; the courts are not permitted to substitute their own judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence.

       Decision of the trial court upholding the employee's termination was supported by substantial evidence because a reasonable person could have concluded that the employee's continued refusal to cooperate with or obey the directives of the lieutenant in connection with the final ride along session was insubordination and exhibited a willful failure to follow lawful instructions.
