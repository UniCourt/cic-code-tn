      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2010, ch. 1100, § 27(a) purported to amend this section by substituting “Intellectual disability” for “Mental retardation” at the beginning of subdivision (A) of the former definition of “mental retardation”, effective January 15, 2011. Acts 2010, ch. 734, § 1 made the same amendment to the former definition of “mental retardation” effective April 9, 2010; therefore, the amendment by Acts 2010, ch. 1100, § 27(a) was not given effect.

       <p>
        The department serves as the state's mental health and developmental disabilities authority and is responsible for system planning, setting policy and quality standards, system monitoring and evaluation, disseminating public information and advocacy for persons of all ages who have mental illness, serious emotional disturbance, or developmental disabilities. It is the policy of the state to plan on the basis of and to promote the use of private and public service providers, without regard for funding source, to achieve outcomes and accomplishments that create opportunities for service recipients and potential service recipients to have the greatest possible control of their lives in the least restrictive environment that is appropriate for each person. The department shall plan for and promote the availability of a comprehensive array of high quality prevention, early intervention, treatment, and habilitation services and supports based on the needs and choices of service recipients and families served. The department shall include service recipients and members of service recipients' families in planning, developing, and monitoring the service systems.

        It is the intent of the general assembly that the system of care developed to reflect § 33-2-102 provides a comprehensive array of services and supports that are geographically available, equitably and efficiently allocated statewide and in each grand division of the state, that allows people to be in their own community settings, based on the needs and choices of individuals and families served. Services and supports provided to persons generally and as part of the medical assistance program, pursuant to title 71, chapter 5, shall seek to alleviate geographic service and support disparities across the state and its grand divisions. In striving to alleviate the geographic disparities, the state should seek to allocate budget improvements and other new resources in a manner that promotes equitable distribution of services and supports among the grand divisions of the state.

           In a case involving sanctions levied against the home and community based services waiver service providers and their professional trade organization, the Tennessee Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (TDIDD) imposed sanctions against the providers for deficient practices, as opposed to civil penalties for violation of T.C.A. tit. 33 or TDIDD rules; thus, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t33c02s33-2-407ol1c" target="_self">33-2-407(c)</a></cite> (and specifically the 15-day time period set out therein) was not applicable, and, instead, the correct statute was T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t33c02s33-2-408" target="_self">33-2-408</a></cite>.

          <p>
           In a case involving sanctions levied against the home and community based services waiver service providers and their professional trade organization, the providers breached the provider agreement, provider manual, and the waiver by submitting bills for services the providers were not authorized to provide, i.e., day services in excess of the 243-day limit; the providers'  deficient practices had the potential to negate the State's ability to receive federal funds for provision of waiver services; and the Tennessee Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities was statutorily authorized to impose sanctions as a means of enforcing proper practices by the providers.

           Summary judgment was properly granted to the Tennessee Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (TDIDD) in a case involving sanctions levied against the home and community based services waiver service providers and their professional trade organization because, despite the warning letters, in 2014, the service providers continued to bill for more than 243 days of day services for some service recipients; the providers'  breach of the provider agreement and violation of the waiver constituted deficient practices, which were punishable by sanctions; there was no limit on the amount of financial sanctions that TDIDD could impose for deficient practices; and the sanctions did not exceed the amounts set out in TDIDD policy.

           In a case involving sanctions levied against the home and community based services waiver service providers and their professional trade organization, because this statute did not impose a specific time frame, the 10-day time period set out in the Tennessee Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (TDIDD) Policy #80.4.6 for an appeal did not exceeds the statutory of TDIDD authority; furthermore, the Policy met the requirements of this statute insofar as the Policy provided for application of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act procedures, required TDIDD to send notice of sanctions to the provider, and provided an opportunity for hearing before imposition of sanctions.

           In a case involving sanctions levied against the home and community based services waiver service providers and their professional trade organization, there was no need to promulgate a rule regarding the 243-day limit for day services as there was no change in the interpretation of the waiver because the decision of the Tennessee Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (TDIDD) to strictly enforce an existing requirement, after notice to the providers, did not change the requirement; the 243-day billing limit was a requirement, to which the providers agreed to be bound by executing the provider agreement; and, under the agreement, TDIDD could have sanctioned for billing overages at any time after 2005.

            Every licensee under this title shall have a clear conflict resolution procedure, including an appeal process, that complies with the department's rules and shall communicate the procedure to each service recipient and family involved in the service. Termination of service or support because a third party payer refuses to continue to fund the service or support is not subject to the conflict resolution procedure. The location where service or support is to be provided is not subject to the conflict resolution procedure unless the location is inaccessible to the service recipient and the service recipient's family, as appropriate. The procedure must include the means to resolve a conflict informally and expeditiously in conformity with the department's rules. A licensee may not cease to provide services and supports to a service recipient with a developmental disability during the pendency of the conflict resolution over the objection of the service recipient.

             Judicial proceedings for the determination of whether a person may be transferred to a facility or continues to be eligible for treatment in a facility to which that person was transferred under part 3 or 4 of this chapter, may be commenced by filing a complaint in circuit court where the receiving department facility is located. The person or a parent, legal guardian, legal custodian, conservator, spouse or responsible relative of the person may initiate the review proceedings.

Although Tennessee had amended its laws to guarantee discharge at the request of a resident with capacity, there had been no significant change in the law for purposes of Rule 60(b)(5) because the MR residents remained involuntarily committed given that they depended upon the request of a parent or other legal representative to be discharged.

          <p>
           When a patient was injured after leaving a hospital against medical advice, the hospital was not liable to the patient based on the hospital's failure to detain the patient against the patient's will because (1) Tennessee's involuntary commitment statutes controlled, (2) the only statutorily authorized person who examined the patient completed no certificate of need authorizing the hospital to detain the patient and did not intend to, and a nurse or other hospital employee was not statutorily authorized to detain the patient, so the hospital had no duty to prevent the patient from leaving.

            Trial court committed reversible error in ordering defendant to be involuntarily hospitalized, because the involuntary commitment statute does not include risk of damage to property as a ground for such commitment; even if the statute were to specifically include damage to property in its definition of “a substantial likelihood of serious harm,” the possibility that others would take advantage of defendant's condition to cheat him out of his property would not constitute a sufficient basis to confine him against his will, in violation of his constitutional rights.

              Discharge of defendant, who was involuntary committed years earlier after being found not guilty of first degree murder by reason of insanity, was appropriate because defendant no longer met the criteria for continued hospitalization and was eligible for discharge as defendant's attending psychiatrist and other psychiatrists recommended the discharge. While evidence was presented that defendant would voluntarily continue treatment after discharge, there was no evidence that rebutted the presumption of correctness granted to the discharge plan.

            When a defendant charged with a criminal offense is believed to be incompetent to stand trial, or there is a question about the defendant's mental capacity at the time of the commission of the crime, the criminal, circuit, or general sessions court judge may, upon the judge's own motion or upon petition by the district attorney general or by the attorney for the defendant and after hearing, order the defendant to be evaluated on an outpatient basis. The evaluation shall be done by the community mental health center or licensed private practitioner designated by the commissioner to serve the court or, if the evaluation cannot be made by the center or the private practitioner, on an outpatient basis by the state hospital or the state-supported hospital designated by the commissioner to serve the court. If, and only if, the outpatient evaluator concludes that further evaluation and treatment are needed, the court may order the defendant hospitalized, and if in a department facility, in the custody of the commissioner for not more than thirty (30) days for further evaluation and treatment for competence to stand trial subject to the availability of suitable accommodations.

If the defendant is indigent, the amount and payment of the costs for the evaluation shall be determined and paid for by the administrative office of the courts. If the defendant is not indigent, the cost of the evaluation shall be charged as court costs. If the evaluation cannot be done on an outpatient basis and if it is necessary to hospitalize the defendant in a department facility, hospitalization shall not be for more than thirty (30) days and shall be subject to available suitable accommodations.

          Trial court did not err in finding defendant competent to stand trial because two doctors testified that defendant was malingering and that his IQ was not as low as demonstrated during testing; that defendant had at least a rudimentary understanding of the charges against him, the roles of the parties, and the role of the judge; and that, with care, defendant could assist his attorneys in his own defense.

         <p>
          Prior to the 1977 amendment that added subsection (e), where the evidence in a first-degree murder case indicated that defendant, who relied on a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity, was competent to stand trial, no prejudice resulted from the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury concerning the possible legal effects of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity under this discretionary section. Edwards v. State, 540 S.W.2d 641, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 564 (Tenn. 1976).
         </p>
         <p>
          At trial before the effective date of the 1977 amendment of this section, the trial judge properly refused to charge the jury concerning the civil commitment laws pertaining to persons adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity where there was no competent evidence before the jury tending to show that the defendant was not guilty by reason of insanity. Matlock v. State, 566 S.W.2d 892, 1978 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 299 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978).
         </p>
         <p>
          Prior to the 1977 amendment it was not error to refuse to charge a jury as to what the effect of a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity would be, because the charge is not relevant to the issue of guilty or innocence, and there were so many options and alternatives available, depending upon the mental condition of the accused, it would have been highly conjectural and would have involved the jury in speculation as to what might happen to the accused. Glasscock v. State, 570 S.W.2d 354, 1978 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 318 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978), cert. denied, Glasscock v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">441 U.S. 943</cite>, <cite class="s_court">99 S. Ct. 2160</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">60 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1044, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1817 (1979).
         </p>
         <p>
          Although the trial judge erred in charging the jury on the defense of insanity while not at the same time complying with clear mandate of a former version of this section that he also instruct the jury “that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity … shall result in automatic detention of the person so acquitted in a mental hospital or treatment center,” this error did not require reversal, because in the absence of a prima facie showing of insanity, the proof was such that the jury could not reasonably have found the defendant to be other than sane. Thus the failure to charge the jury under subsection (e) of this section did not affect the outcome of the trial, and the error had to be deemed harmless. Mothershed v. State, 578 S.W.2d 96, 1978 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 283 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978).

          Improper argument by prosecutor to the effect that if jury found defendant not guilty by reason of insanity he would be evaluated and it would be left up to some psychiatrist to decide when he would be put back on the street was held harmless under the circumstances. State v. Estes, 655 S.W.2d 179, 1983 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 397 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1983).

       <p>
        The Interstate Compact on Mental Health is enacted into law and entered into by this state with all other states legally joining the compact in the form substantially as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        Interstate Compact on Mental Health
       </p>
       <p>
        The contracting states solemnly agree that:
       </p>
       <p>
        Article I
       </p>
       <p>
        The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Article II
       </p>
       <p>

         “Institution” means any hospital or other facility maintained by a party state or political subdivision thereof for the care and treatment of mental illness or mental deficiency;

         “Mental deficiency” means mental deficiency as defined by appropriate clinical authorities to such extent that a person so afflicted is incapable of managing such persons and such persons affairs, but does not include mental illness as defined herein;
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol14">
         “Mental illness” means mental disease to such extent that a person so afflicted requires care and treatment for that person's own welfare, or the welfare of others, or of the community;

       </p>
       <ol class="alpha">
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol2a">
         Whenever a person physically present in any party state shall be in need of institutionalization by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, such person shall be eligible for care and treatment in an institution in that state irrespective of such person's residence, settlement or citizenship qualifications.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol2b">
         The provisions of paragraph (a) of this article to the contrary notwithstanding, any patient may be transferred to an institution in another state whenever there are factors based upon clinical determinations indicating that the care and treatment of the patient would be facilitated or improved thereby. Any such institutionalization may be for the entire period of care and treatment or for any portion or portions thereof. The factors referred to in this paragraph include the patient's full record with due regard for the location of the patient's family, character of the illness and probable duration thereof, and such other factors as shall be considered appropriate.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol2c">
         No state shall be obliged to receive any patient pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this article unless the sending state has given advance notice of its intention to send the patient; furnished all available medical and other pertinent records concerning the patient; given the qualified medical or other appropriate clinical authorities of the receiving state an opportunity to examine the patient if such authorities so wish; and unless the receiving state shall agree to accept the patient.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol2d">
         In the event that the laws of the receiving state establish a system of priorities for the admission of patients, an interstate patient under this compact shall receive the same priority as a local patient and shall be taken in the same order and at the same time that such interstate patient would be taken if such interstate patient were a local patient.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol2e">
         Pursuant to this compact, the determination as to the suitable place of institutionalization for a patient may be reviewed at any time and such further transfer of the patient may be made as seems likely to be in the best interest of the patient.

        Article IV

        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol3a">
         Whenever, pursuant to the laws of the state in which a patient is physically present, it shall be determined that the patient should receive aftercare or supervision, such care or supervision may be provided in a receiving state. If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that aftercare in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such aftercare in the receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient's intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient, and such other documents as may be pertinent.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol3b">
         If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state and the appropriate authorities in the receiving state find that the best interest of the patient would be served thereby, and if the public safety would not be jeopardized thereby, the patient may receive aftercare or supervision in the receiving state.
        </li>
        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol3c">
         In supervising, treating, or caring for a patient on aftercare pursuant to the terms of this article, a receiving state shall employ the same standards of visitation, examination, care, and treatment that it employs for similar local patients.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Article V
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever a dangerous or potentially dangerous patient escapes from an institution in any party state, that state shall promptly notify all appropriate authorities within and without the jurisdiction of the escape in a manner reasonably calculated to facilitate the speedy apprehension of the escapee. Immediately upon the apprehension and identification of any such dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, such patient shall be detained in the state where found pending disposition in accordance with law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Article VI
       </p>
       <p>
        The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the patient, shall be permitted to transport any patient being moved pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact, without interference.

         No person shall be deemed a patient of more than one (1) institution at any given time. Completion of transfer of any patient to an institution in a receiving state shall have the effect of making the person a patient of the institution in the receiving state.

        <li id="t33c09s33-9-201ol4b">
         The sending state shall pay all costs of and incidental to the transportation of any patient pursuant to this compact, but any two (2) or more party states may, by making a specific agreement for that purpose, arrange for a different allocation of costs as among themselves.

         The general assembly finds that any proposition to increase the legal drinking age raises many issues and involves many organizations in both the public and private sector. First, a disproportionate number of fatal highway accidents involve both people under twenty-five (25) years of age and the use of alcoholic beverages. Second, the public school system is not consistently using a curriculum that emphasizes the effects of alcoholic beverages on individuals and their communities. Third, resources for early intervention programs for high-risk children who abuse alcoholic beverages are widely scattered and often unavailable to many children. Fourth, the state does not presently operate or have a contractual relationship for residential treatment facilities for the care and treatment of children who abuse alcoholic beverages and other drugs. Fifth, sanctions for present violations of the Tennessee alcoholic beverage and beer licensing statutes concerning sales to minors are often not imposed, because of varying standards, as well as a lack of knowledge on the part of licensing authorities.

           Any county may, pursuant to this part, provide facilities and services for the treatment or housing, or both, of a person intoxicated or incapacitated, or both, by alcohol in lieu of arrest. In such county or counties, when any person is intoxicated or incapacitated by alcohol and is clearly dangerous to the health and safety of the person or others, the person may be taken into protective custody by law enforcement authorities or custodial health officers, acting with probable cause, and taken to an approved treatment or social services facility. For purposes of determining whether a person is clearly dangerous to the person's health and safety, the degree of intoxication alone is sufficient, if the enforcement officer reasonably believes that the individual is unable to avoid severe impairment or injury from specific risks by or as a result of intoxication.

A taking into protective custody under this section is not an arrest and no entry or other records shall be made to indicate that the person has been arrested or charged with a crime.

The application shall be directed to the administrator of the facility and shall state the circumstances requiring evaluation, detention and treatment, including the applicant's personal observations and the specific statements of other persons having relevant knowledge of the person's intoxication or incapacitation, or both, and the danger posed to the person or others, upon which the officer relies in initially detaining the person and in making the application.
