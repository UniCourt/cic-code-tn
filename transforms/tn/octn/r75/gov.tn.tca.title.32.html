        The act entitled “An act to make uniform the execution of wills and repealing all acts in conflict therewith” was not unconstitutional for being broader than caption. McClure v. Wade, 34 Tenn. App. 154, 235 S.W.2d 835, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 138, 28 A.L.R.2d 104 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).

        Compliance with the statutory conditions prescribed is essential to the execution of a will. Eslick v. Wodicka, 31 Tenn. App. 333, 215 S.W.2d 12, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 95 (Tenn. Ct.

        Money deposited in a savings and loan association under “discretionary revocable trust agreement” by which the depositor could draw out funds at any time or completely withdraw the account with the funds going to the beneficiary upon the death of the depositor was a valid gift to take effect at death although not in compliance with the statute relating to the execution of wills.

        A paper writing properly executed with the formalities required for making a will which appoints a personal representative and gives that representative certain powers but does not make any disposition of property may be admitted to probate as a will.

        Where a widow filed a declaratory judgment petition with a third codicil that was previously undiscovered attached, prior to the trial court entering an order admitting the will and the first two codicils to probate in solemn form, the trial court had an obligation to bring the proceedings to a halt and conduct an inquiry into whether the widow had standing to pursue a will contest under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c04s32-4-101" target="_self">32-4-101</a></cite> and not doing so was reversible error. The third codicil, if admitted to probate, would undoubtedly have operated as a partial revocation of the earlier will and codicils under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-201ol11" target="_self">32-1-201(1)</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-101ol12" target="_self">32-1-101(2)</a></cite>.

        Affidavit was inaccurate because the witnesses did not sign the “foregoing” will, they only signed the affidavit and their signatures did not appear anywhere else in the document, and because the affidavit referred to the will as a “foregoing” document, it could not be concluded that the affidavit was part of the will so as to have satisfied statutory will execution requirements; thus, the decedent died intestate.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying proponents motion under Tenn. R. Civ.

        Proponents were not entitled to relief under Tenn. R. Civ.

        Contestants did not waive any claim that the relief the proponents sought under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 60.02 was unconstitutional by failing to give notice to the attorney general because the contestants were not questioning the validity of subsection (b) or its retroactive application to certain wills; rather, the contestants argued the retroactive application of the statute was constitutionally impermissible because the will contest was concluded by final judgment before the statute's enactment.

        Subsection (b) did not permit proponents of a will to relitigate the will contest on the basis that the applicable law was amended because the will contest was fully and fairly litigated in accordance with the law as it existed at that time; the court of appeals concluded that the will was not properly executed pursuant to the statute's requirements, the supreme court denied certiorari, and the parties entered an agreed final judgment conceding the will contest.

        Where first witness stated that testatrix came into his office with a paper purported to be her will, and that after she signed the will he signed it and also had his secretary seated close by sign as second witness the will was valid though witnesses to will did not remember every detail of signature and attestation where contestants failed to introduce any affirmative evidence that will had not been legally and regularly executed in accordance with requirements of this section.

        In will contest on trial of issues devisavit vel non the general burden is upon the proponent of the will to establish that the paper propounded as a will was the voluntary act of a capable testator and that the formalities required by law were complied with in its execution, but unless the testator was illiterate or there are circumstances of suspicion surrounding the case it is not necessary for the proponents to prove the testator's capacity or that he had knowledge of the contents of the will.

        Proof of the genuine signatures of the testator and two competent attesting witnesses of a will along with an attestation clause reciting that the will was executed according to this section created a rebuttable presumption of fact of due execution of the will and made a prima facie case for the proponent.

        Presumption of due execution of the will created by the attestation clause was not rebutted because, while not sufficient to meet the requirements of a self-proving affidavit, the provision at the end of the will signed by the witnesses that recited the formalities required for a will created a rebuttable presumption of due execution; and the evidence presented was not contrary to the attestation clause as the first witness's lack of memory regarding whether the second witness was present when the testator signed the will or if the testator informed the second witness that the document was his will did not constitute positive testimony that the recitals in the attestation clause were inaccurate.

        Because the decedent's adult stepchild did not have the authority to sign the decedent's will on behalf of the decedent, the trial court's instructing the jury that the stepchild could sign the will on behalf of the decedent was error. However, the error was harmless as the appellate court was unable to conclude that the error more probably than not affected the outcome of the verdict. Johnson-Murray v.

        The effect of this provision, excluding the requirement that a holographic will must be placed with the valuable papers of the deceased, or given to another for safekeeping is to reduce the place of deposit from an essential factor to an evidential circumstance relevant to the animus testandi. Smith v. Smith, 33 Tenn. App. 507, 232 S.W.2d 338, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 133 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The only statutory requirements now are that the signature and all material provisions of the propounded instrument must be in the handwriting of the testator and his handwriting be proved by two witnesses. Smith v. Smith, 33 Tenn. App. 507, 232 S.W.2d 338, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 133 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section dispenses with the requirement that the propounded instrument must have been found among the valuable papers of the decedent or lodged in the hands of another for safekeeping; but under the general rules of evidence, the place where the propounded paper was kept by the writer and found after his death is still a circumstance of no little probative value to be considered along with all the other facts and circumstances upon the question of whether he intended it to operate as a will. Smith v. Smith, 33 Tenn. App. 507, 232 S.W.2d 338, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 133 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        A holographic will needs no formalism and therefore two continuous papers, found with valuables, entirely in decedent's handwriting showing intent to make a will and make it available, was entitled to probate, although written in indelible and regular pencil, not dated or signed, and not naming an executor as promised. Nicley v. Nicley, 38 Tenn. App. 472, 276 S.W.2d 497, 1954 Tenn. App. LEXIS 136 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that certain typewriting from old will appeared on the same page as the holographic will did not invalidate the holographic will. In re Estate of Jones, 44 Tenn. App. 323, 314 S.W.2d 39, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 159 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where two holographic wills were presented for probate some significance must be attached to the fact that one will was witnessed and signed by two witnesses while the other was not subjected to such formality. In re Will of Padgett, 51 Tenn. App. 134, 364 S.W.2d 947, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 99 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decedent's deathbed statements concerning the disposition of the decedent's estate, even if taken as true, were not legally binding. Accordingly, while the parties may have felt a moral imperative to abide by the decedent's stated wishes, there was no legal duty to do so. Mills v. Mills, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 504 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substance of a holographic will prevails over the form, and the fact that the document in question had an informal nature did not mean that it could not be a holographic will, as testamentary intent controls; nevertheless, context is crucial, and the Questionnaire completed by the decedent constituted the beginning stages of addressing her estate plan and was not a final product demonstrating her intention to dispose of her property, and thus the questionnaire was not a valid holographic will. In re Estate of Pierce, 511 S.W.3d 520, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 514 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 22, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 868 (Tenn. Nov. 16, 2016).

        To determine whether holographic codicil contained all material provisions in testatrix's handwriting, the trial court properly considered testatrix's intent. In re Will of Tipler, 10 S.W.3d 244, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 841 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).

       <p>
        A testamentary intent must accompany the performance of the statutory requirements and this must be proven in a manner which conforms to applicable rules of evidence and procedure. Otherwise the script cannot be accepted as a will. Smith v. Smith, 33 Tenn. App. 507, 232 S.W.2d 338, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 133 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        A holographic will was not valid when there was no evidence, intrinsic or extrinsic, that the decedent intended the paper to be her will but where she drew lines through part of it, left a date and attestation clause blank, though it was incomplete, discarded it in a junk room, and attempted to leave property in other instruments. Davidson v. Gilreath, 38 Tenn. App. 291, 273 S.W.2d 717, 1954 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1954).

        Document was not a holographic will, and the decedent died intestate, because the document was not the last will and testament of the decedent as the requisite testamentary intent did not accompany the preparation and execution of the document, as more was required than simply asserting proof that the document was in the decedent's handwriting and signed, and absent a clear showing of testamentary intent, the writing failed as a testamentary document.

        Where purported holographic will was found in bottom drawer of deceased's desk, under old books, written in pencil on scratch paper, containing erasures and memoranda, but signed and dated, these facts and circumstances, taken together, were sufficient to support conclusion that deceased had not finally resolved that the propounded script should be effective as his last will and testament, and hence the animus testandi was lacking.

        Where two holographic wills were presented for probate significance must be attached to the fact that one will was lodged with the executrix for safekeeping in her lockbox along with an itemized list of the deceased's properties, while on the other hand the other will was found in a cubby-hole in a desk in a sewing room and never mentioned to the executrix nor the maid nor anyone else as being the will of the deceased.

        The presence or absence of formal attestation to a holographic will is not a matter which the trial judge should tell the jury that they “must” accord some significance. Boyd v. Boyd, 680 S.W.2d 462, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 884 (Tenn. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory requirements for a holographic will were met, as the handwritten document was the decedent's handwriting and the requirements of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-105" target="_self">32-1-105</a></cite> were met; the decedent took several concrete actions that demonstrated revocation of the first will where she wrote the second will and signed it and titled it a will, and there was no evidence that she stated she intended to make a will in the future or was just thinking about it, and the evidence clearly preponderated that the handwritten will embodied the decedent's final wishes. Estate of Meade v. Gilliam, 156 S.W.3d 841, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 568 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, In re Estate of Meade, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 172 (Tenn. Feb. 28, 2005).

        Material evidence supported the jury's determination that the father's handwritten document was not a valid holographic will under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-105" target="_self">32-1-105</a></cite>, because the circumstances surrounding the father's execution of the document did not indicate testamentary intent, as none of the witnesses present when he wrote and signed it testified that the father explicitly told them that he intended it to be his will; the barely legible solitary statement that the will proponent could do whatever he wanted with everything after the father passed did not exhibit testamentary intent.

        The statute of 29th Charles II, ch. 3, is not in force in this state, but its provisions in relation to wills were substantially reenacted by the statute contained in this section. Therefore, the decisions of the English courts, in relation to the execution and proof of wills, are entitled to great weight in investigations of like character. Weatherhead v. Sewell, 28 Tenn. 272, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1848); Long v. Mickler, 133 Tenn. 51, 179 S.W. 477, 1915 Tenn.

        It is not error, on the trial of an issue of devisavit vel non, for the trial judge to exclude from the jury the instrument propounded for probate as a will, where it is in the form of an absolute deed, wholly excluding the idea of a will, and intended to be a deed, but is unsigned and unexecuted, and there is no evidence tending to show that it was intended to be a will, but, on the contrary, the evidence shows it was intended to be a deed. Such paper cannot even be established as a testamentary disposition of personalty. Johnson v. Johnson, 103 Tenn. 32, 52 S.W. 814, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1899).

        A paper in the form of a deed, duly acknowledged and legally delivered, giving certain designated land to a certain person at the death of the giver, is an irrevocable deed, and not a testamentary paper. It conveys a present or vested remainder estate to be enjoyed after the death of the grantor. Johnson v. Mitchell, 20 Tenn. 168, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1839); Walls' Adm'r v.

        An instrument in the form of a deed, reciting that, in consideration of love and affection, the grantor conveys to certain parties all his title to a certain tract of land, but providing that he is to hold the same in his own name, and have all the rents of the tract of land until his death, then to be divided between the donees, is a deed conveying a present interest, and not a testamentary paper.

        The grantor in a deed of conveyance of land may reserve unto himself a power of revocation without thereby rendering the deed invalid or inoperative, or without converting the same into a will, for such reservation does not convert an instrument into a will where it would otherwise be a deed.

        It is not necessary that an instrument be in testamentary form in order to operate as a will, and the form of a paper does not affect right to probate it, provided it is the intention of the deceased that it should operate after his death. For instance, deeds poll, indentures, deeds of gift, bonds, marriage settlements, letters, drafts on bankers, stocks and bills indorsed “for A B,” an indorsement on a note “I give this note to C D,” promissory notes, and notes payable by executors to evade legacy duties have been held to be testamentary. McLean v. McLean, 25 Tenn. 452, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1846).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a paper contains a disposition of the maker's property to be made after death, though it was not intended to be a will or other testamentary instrument, but an instrument of a different character, it may, nevertheless, operate as a will, if it cannot operate in the character which was intended. McLean v. McLean, 25 Tenn. 452, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1846); Johnson v. Johnson, 103 Tenn. 32, 52 S.W. 814, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1899); Howell v. Brown, 7 Tenn. App. 380, 1928 Tenn.

       </p>

        It should manifestly appear that it is intended as a disposition of the testator's lands, to take effect at his death; and this intention will best appear, if the paper has the usual formality of a will. Crutcher v. Crutcher, 30 Tenn. 377, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1850).

        Though an instrument is in the form of a deed, and is called a deed by the maker, and is supported by a consideration, yet if it purports to convey a title which does not arise until the death of the maker, it is a will.

        A will, ineffectual to pass realty because not executed with the solemnities required for such purpose, will be good to pass personalty, if executed with the solemnities required for that purpose, though the maker intended it to operate as to both realty and personalty.

       <p>
        A very informal instrument, and in some instances an imperfect paper, neither written nor signed by the deceased, may be set up as a will of personalty; and, although the presumption of the law is against every paper not actually executed by the testator, the presumption may be rebutted by showing that the deceased regarded it as a will, and meant it to operate in its existing state, as where its imperfection has been produced and its formal execution by signature and attestation has been prevented, not by abandonment of the testamentary scheme, or change of purpose on the part of the testator, but by the act of God, if the paper, as far as it goes, expresses the will of the deceased continuing to the time of his death.

        A will, to pass real estate, must be attested by at least two disinterested subscribing witnesses, in the presence of the testator and at his request, though it is not necessary that they should subscribe their respective names in the presence of each other, but they may do so separately and at different times. Logue v. Stanton, 37 Tenn. 97, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1857); Simmons v. Leonard, 91 Tenn. 183, 18 S.W. 280, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 92, 30 Am. St. Rep. 875 (1892).

        The witnesses may attest separately and at different times, but each must do so in the presence and at request of testator. Logue v. Stanton, 37 Tenn. 97, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1857); Long v. Mickler, 133 Tenn. 51, 179 S.W. 477, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1915), superseded by statute as stated in, In re Estate of Archer, — S.W.2d —, 1989 Tenn. App. LEXIS 454 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 21, 1989).

       <p>
        Sons of testator who were devised no real estate under the will were competent to testify as subscribing witnesses, since they were not interested at the time of execution of the will. Allen v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 172, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1812).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the subscribing witness was competent at the time of his attestation, his subsequent legal incompetency will not affect the validity of the will. The interest in the devise of lands that renders the subscribing witnesses incompetent imports an interest derived or derivable from the will itself, and not from subsequent events or contingencies, such as inheritance or devise from the devisee under the attested will. Allen v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 172, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1812); Walker v. Skeene, 40 Tenn. 1, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1859); Maxwell v. Hill, 89 Tenn. 584, 15 S.W. 253, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        Those who would, in case of intestacy, be the testator's heirs at his death, and would take his lands by descent, are competent subscribing witnesses to his will, if there is no devise of land to them, and they may prove the execution thereof against their own interest. Allen v. Allen, 2 Tenn. 172, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1812); Walker v. Skeene, 40 Tenn. 1, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1859); Maxwell v. Hill, 89 Tenn. 584, 15 S.W. 253, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        The testator's daughter is a competent subscribing witness to his will devising no lands to her, but devising certain land to her brothers, with a provision that they support her so long as she remains single, for such provision creates in her no estate or interest, and her support is not even a charge upon such land or the estate. Walker v. Skeene, 40 Tenn. 1, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question is reserved whether a person who takes an interest in the devise of land, under a will which is neutralized or overbalanced by a contrary interest of equal or greater value in the estate, in case of an intestacy, or from other cause, is competent. Walker v. Skeene, 40 Tenn. 1, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        A legatee is a competent subscribing witness to a will bequeathing personalty and devising realty. Walker v. Skeene, 40 Tenn. 1, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1859); Beadles v. Alexander, 68 Tenn. 604, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        A devisee cannot by a transfer of his interest become a competent witness on issue of devisavit vel non. Barbee v. Mason, 45 Tenn. 108, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1867).
       </p>
       <p>
        A subscribing witness to a will is not “interested in the devise” of the lands of the testator, in the sense of the statute, so as to disqualify him as such and render the will void, unless he is a beneficiary under the devise. Maxwell v. Hill, 89 Tenn. 584, 15 S.W. 253, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1891).

        The name of the subscribing witness to a will devising land may, by his direction, be written by another person; but he must make his mark to his name, or touch the pen, or let his hand be guided by the other person in writing his name, in order to make it his signature. Ford v. Ford, 26 Tenn. 92, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1846); Rose v. Allen, 41 Tenn. 23, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1860); Simmons v. Leonard, 91 Tenn. 183, 18 S.W. 280, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 92, 30 Am.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the name of the subscribing witness to a will devising land is written by a person who is a devisee under the will, and without the witness making his mark or participating in writing his name, though done at the request and by the direction of the witness, the attestation and subscription is ineffectual. Simmons v. Leonard, 91 Tenn. 183, 18 S.W. 280, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 92, 30 Am. St. Rep. 875 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        The practice of attesting a will by the mark of the subscribing witness, made beside his name written by another, should not be encouraged or extended. McFarland v. Bush, 94 Tenn. 538, 29 S.W. 899, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 66, 45 Am. St. Rep. 760, <cite class="lra">27 L.R.A. 662</cite> (1894).

       <p>
        Where the will is written on separate pieces of paper, and the last piece only is signed by the subscribing witnesses, it is necessary that all the pieces be produced at the time of the attestation; but this fact may be proved by circumstances.

        The testator's unattested alteration of his attested will, both as to realty and personalty, is effective as to the personalty, but not as to the realty. Greer v. Mc'Crackin, 7 Tenn. 300, 7 Tenn. 301, 1824 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1824).

       <p>
        Although a will devising lands, with only one subscribing witness, is not good, yet, if there be a subsequent codicil properly attested, the defect is cured, and the original will is as operative as if it had been attested by two subscribing witnesses. The codicil amounts to a republication of the will. Stover v. Kendall, 41 Tenn. 557, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1860).

        Statute requiring will to be subscribed by at least two witnesses applies to the execution of the will, and not to the manner of proving that it was duly executed on an issue of devisavit vel non. Wheeler v. Parr, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 374 (1912).

        In a will contest the proponents were not harmed by the failure of the court in its charge to the jury to differentiate between wills of personalty and wills of realty since the proponents had never overcome the presumption of law against wills of personalty and in fact had never tendered that issue to the court and jury and had never offered proof to support such a contention.

        The authority to devise real property by a holographic testament is purely statutory and an exception to the general rule prescribing the manner in which real property must be devised and to be effective such will must comply with the terms of the statute.

       <p>
        A will to operate as such must, as a rule, make or attempt a total or partial disposition of property, to take effect at the testator's death, or at least must name an executor; and it is not enough that the instrument purports to be a will and is executed with all the testamentary formalities, when it accomplishes nothing of a testamentary character. Howell v. Moore, 14 Tenn. App. 594, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is intention of this statute that the writing shall appear to be a will whose existence and place of deposit are known to the testator and that he has it in his care and protection, preserving it as his will. Pulley v. Cartwright, 23 Tenn. App. 690, 137 S.W.2d 336, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Will in handwriting of deceased and signed by deceased and wife and which stated “Here is our will-at our death-all in our name goes to W.M. Owens and Elvis Owens at our death” could not be probated as the will of the deceased, since it did not take effect upon death of deceased but took effect after death of deceased and wife. McDaniel v. Owens, 39 Tenn. App. 73, 281 S.W.2d 259, 1954 Tenn. App. LEXIS 158 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1954).

        A testamentary writing found amongst the valuable papers of the deceased, complying with all the requisites of the statute, and proved in the manner required by the statute, is equivalent to an express publication before witnesses, because it is to be inferred from such circumstances that the party intended to give effect to the paper as his will; but it should, in addition, manifestly appear that such writing was intended as a disposition of the testator's lands, to take effect as his death, and this intention will best appear, if the paper has the usual formality of a will. Crutcher v. Crutcher, 30 Tenn. 377, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1850); Marr v. Marr, 37 Tenn. 385, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1858); Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859); Howell v.

       </p>
       <p>
        All the requisites of the statute must be complied with in order to establish a holographic will sufficient to pass title to land. Fransioli v. Podesta, 175 Tenn. 340, 134 S.W.2d 162, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that is required under statute to constitute “a paper writing appearing to be the will of a deceased person” is that writing shall purport to be disposition of writer's property after his death; and any writing, however informal, undertaking to so dispose of property, or to control its disposition, falls within statute on this point whether language used be sufficient for purpose intended or not, that being a matter of construction by proper court after testamentary character of instrument has been determined. Pulley v. Cartwright, 23 Tenn. App. 690, 137 S.W.2d 336, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section only requires that to be a will the paper offered for probate shall purport to be a disposition of the writer's property after his death, however informal the expressions used, and without regard to whether the language employed by the writer is sufficient for the purpose intended, that being a matter of construction by the proper court after the testamentary character of the instrument has been established. Carver v. Anthony, 35 Tenn. App. 306, 245 S.W.2d 422, 1951 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1951).

        In order to constitute the unattested writing a valid testamentary paper, all the statutory requisites of holographic wills must concur, and are indispensable. Crutcher v. Crutcher, 30 Tenn. 377, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1850); Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859); Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867); Brogan v. Barnard, 115 Tenn. 260, 90 S.W. 858, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 58, 112 Am. St. Rep. 822 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        All requirements are equally important. Brogan v. Barnard, 115 Tenn. 260, 90 S.W. 858, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 58, 112 Am. St. Rep. 822 (1905); Howell v. Moore, 14 Tenn. App. 594, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order that a will may be good and sufficient to give and convey lands in Tennessee, it must conform to the requirements of this section or § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-109" target="_self">32-1-109</a></cite>. Howell v. Moore, 14 Tenn. App. 594, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no distinction between a holographic will and one under the general statute on the question of incompleteness since a holographic will, when the requirements of statute are complied with, is of the same dignity as a will attested by subscribing witnesses. Campbell v. Henley, 172 Tenn. 135, 110 S.W.2d 329, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirements as to execution of will devising real estate are more strict than those relating to personalty. Fransioli v. Podesta, 21 Tenn. App. 577, 113 S.W.2d 769, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 59 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be strict compliance with requirements of statute in order to effectuate valid devise of realty. Fransioli v. Podesta, 21 Tenn. App. 577, 113 S.W.2d 769, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 59 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Holographic will must conform to requirements of this statute in order that it may be good and sufficient to convey lands in Tennessee. Pulley v. Cartwright, 23 Tenn. App. 690, 137 S.W.2d 336, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).

       </h4>
       <p>
        In addition to the statutory requisites for the making of a holographic will, there must be a testamentary intent accompanying the performance of each of the requirements. Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859); Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867); R. B. Douglass & Co. v. Harkrender, 62 Tenn. 114, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 151 (1873).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a person was insane at the time of placing his holographic will among his valuable papers, it will have no effect, because to so place the will requires an intelligent act; and it will require an equally intelligent act to retain the will in such repository, in a lucid interval, to give it effect as a valid disposition of his property. Porter v. Campbell, 61 Tenn. 81, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1872).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where holograph is found among “valuable papers” of testator, it is implied that it must have been placed there by the writer or with his knowledge and assent, and with intent and purpose at the time that it should be his will. Fransioli v. Podesta, 21 Tenn. App. 577, 113 S.W.2d 769, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 59 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where instrument which was alleged to be the holographic will of the deceased bore an attestation clause but bore no signatures by attesting witnesses and where such will was not signed, the mere fact that the instrument was found among the valuable papers of the deceased would not overcome the presumption that deceased did not intend the instrument in its imperfect state to be his will. Campbell v. Henley, 172 Tenn. 135, 110 S.W.2d 329, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alleged holographic will providing that “this is for Elizabeth Joe Charles and Erline after my expenses are all paid I want what I have left to go to you all” was a will falling within statute insofar as its language clearly showed intention of maker concerning disposition of her property after her death. Pulley v. Cartwright, 23 Tenn. App. 690, 137 S.W.2d 336, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this statute it is sufficient if the words of the writing propounded for probate “unequivocally show that the writer intended it as a posthumous disposition of his estate, both real and personal.” Pulley v. Cartwright, 23 Tenn. App. 690, 137 S.W.2d 336, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The form of a paper does not affect the right to have it probated if it was the intention of the deceased that it should operate after his death even though not aware at the time that he had performed a testamentary act. Carver v. Anthony, 35 Tenn. App. 306, 245 S.W.2d 422, 1951 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1951).

        A holographic will may consist of several papers. One of same may be testamentary in character only as nomination of executor. But extrinsic documents not in the handwriting of deceased may not be incorporated in such a will. The documents must be in existence at time will was executed and described. Howell v.

        Entries in a continuous diary, purporting to make a disposition of the writer's land after death, written and signed by him, may be probated as a holographic will, especially where the diary was deposited and found with the account books of the deceased. Reagan v. Stanley, 79 Tenn. 316, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Apr. 1883).
       </p>

        Where a holographic will is written in an account book, it is not error to refuse to allow testimony tending to show that several leaves of the book having no connection with the will, are missing. Chaney v. Bryan, 84 Tenn. 63, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1885).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Whether the papers, among which was found the paper propounded as a decedent's holographic will, were his “valuable papers,” is a question that must be left, under a proper charge, to the jury. Marr v. Marr, 37 Tenn. 385, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1858); Howell v. Moore, 14 Tenn. App. 594, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        A testator's holographic will “found among his valuable papers” implies that it must have been placed there by the writer, or with his knowledge and assent, and not surreptitiously by some other person, and so deposited with the purpose, at the time, that it should be his will. Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859); Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867).
       </p>
       <p>
        The holographic will must have been deposited and found among the testator's valuable papers; and valuable papers are such as the deceased deemed valuable and worthy of preservation. They are not confined to papers having a money value, such as deeds for land, obligations for the payment of money, and certificates of stock. Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859); Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867); R. B. Douglass & Co. v. Harkrender, 62 Tenn. 114, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 151 (1873); Brogan v. Barnard, 115 Tenn. 260, 90 S.W. 858, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 58, 112 Am. St. Rep. 822 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement that the holographic will be deposited and found among the writer's valuable papers is only intended as an indication on the part of the writer that it is his intention to preserve and perpetuate the paper in question as his will disposing of his property, and that he regards it as valuable. Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859); Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867); R. B. Douglass & Co. v. Harkrender, 62 Tenn. 114, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 151 (1873); Reagan v. Stanley, 79 Tenn. 316, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Apr. 1883); Brogan v. Barnard, 115 Tenn. 260, 90 S.W. 858, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 58, 112 Am. St. Rep. 822 (1905); Howell v. Moore, 14 Tenn. App. 594, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whatever number of wills the deceased may have executed after the date of a holographic will, the keeping of the holographic will deposited among his “valuable papers” amounts to a republication at his death, in the absence of any other will, or in the case of the spoliation of a subsequent will, so as to allow the holographic will to stand. Allen v. Jeter, 74 Tenn. 672, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 196 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        The valuable papers need not be papers of monetary value. Reagan v. Stanley, 79 Tenn. 316, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Apr. 1883); Howell v. Moore, 14 Tenn. App. 594, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the paper was found after death in a box in which deceased kept postage stamps for sale and stationery (blank receipts) for use as postmaster, such was not found among his “valuable papers.” Brogan v. Barnard, 115 Tenn. 260, 90 S.W. 858, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 58, 112 Am. St. Rep. 822 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instrument, which was found in pocket of coat hung by deceased in closet, did not qualify for probate as holographic will found among testator's “valuable papers,” although valuable papers were kept by deceased in boxes on closet shelf. Fransioli v. Podesta, 21 Tenn. App. 577, 113 S.W.2d 769, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 59 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Original statute under which holographic will could qualify for probate if found among testator's “valuable papers or effects” was later changed so that such will could qualify only if found among testator's “valuable papers.” Fransioli v. Podesta, 21 Tenn. App. 577, 113 S.W.2d 769, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 59 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section it is necessary for an instrument to be found among the testator's valuable papers and to be complete in order to be given effect as a holographic will. Campbell v. Henley, 172 Tenn. 135, 110 S.W.2d 329, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Within meaning of this statute, “valuable papers” are such as are kept and considered worthy of being taken care of by the particular person, having regard to his condition, business and habits of preserving papers, but are not necessarily the most valuable papers of the decedent, and are not confined to those having a money value, or to deeds for land, obligations for the payment of money or certificates of stock. Pulley v. Cartwright, 23 Tenn. App. 690, 137 S.W.2d 336, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).

        Where not found among the decedent's valuable papers, it must appear that the paper was, by the testator, lodged or deposited with a certain person with a view to its preservation as his will. Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867); McCutchen v. Ochmig, 60 Tenn. 390, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 519 (1873); Hicks v. Burdette, 10 Tenn. App. 492, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        The mere writing of a letter to another containing testamentary provisions, without affirmative and direct proof that the writer intended to lodge it with his correspondent as his holographic will, and for safekeeping, does not answer the requirements of the statute. The connection between the letter and envelope produced upon the trial must be shown by affirmative evidence. McCutchen v. Ochmig, 60 Tenn. 390, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 519 (1873).

        Under provisions relating to probate of holographic will, no particular measure of proof is required; but the act leaves the fact of finding the will, or of its being lodged in the hands of another, and the intention of the deceased in writing and depositing the script, to be established by the same sort and degree of evidence ordinarily used in other cases.

        The handwriting must be so well known, as that, if a false will be propounded for probate, it will be in the power of the persons interested in the estate to expose and defeat it by proof of other witnesses. The fact that the handwriting is known may appear from other facts and circumstances, as well as by direct proof; as, where the deceased had been in business of such character as to bring his handwriting frequently before his acquaintances. Tate v. Tate, 30 Tenn. 465, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1850); Hooper v. McQuary, 45 Tenn. 129, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1867).

        To establish a holographic will, it must appear with reasonable certainty that others beside the witnesses and the family of the testator would testify to the genuineness of the signature, and to this end, a sufficient number of persons, with whom he was usually associated, or transacted business, should be introduced to make it reasonably certain that the others would testify to the same effect.

        Where the writer and signer of a paper as his holographic will procured one witness to the same, with no intent to procure another, but to deposit it among the writer's valuable papers as his will, the fact that there was one witness to it cannot operate as a matter of law to add strength to the presumption that it is his will, nor to raise the presumption that it was an incomplete or unfinished will. But if the writer intended to procure another witness, and thereby to complete the execution of the paper as a witnessed will, until such second witness was procured, it was incomplete and unfinished as a written will.

        If the instrument propounded as a holographic will is unfinished and incomplete, or not subscribed by the testator, though his name is inserted in some part of it, or with an attestation clause and no attesting witnesses, the presumption is that the writer did not intend the paper in that imperfect state to be his will, but the presumptions may be rebutted by satisfactory proof that it was intended, in the form in which it appears, and as far as it goes, to be the last will and testament of the deceased.

        The probate record of a holographic will must show, among other things, that the handwriting of the testator was generally known by his acquaintances and that three credible witnesses proved that the writing and every part of it was in his handwriting, to be valid as to the land devised. Therefore, proof of two witnesses that they were acquainted with the testator's handwriting, and that the signature to the will is in his handwriting, is fatally defective and insufficient to sustain a holographic will of land; but such probate would be good for a will of personalty.

       <p>
        All wills are of equal grade or solemnity, to the extent of their valid provisions, after proper and legal probate; and, therefore, a later informal will, neither signed nor witnessed, if established as a will of personalty, will to that extent revoke a prior holographic will. Reagan v. Stanley, 79 Tenn. 316, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Apr. 1883). See Marr v. Marr, 39 Tenn. 303, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 215 (1859).

       <p>
        Ordinarily it is incompetent to offer as evidence, in proof of revocation, oral declarations of testator, but in an action to establish a holographic will, such statements might be admissible, not to show or work a revocation, but to illustrate the original intent and to show whether the papers were intended to be testamentary in character.

        Where it was sought to establish such a will with reference to personal property of one who was domiciled and died in Ohio, the will could not be established because the laws of that state do not permit such a will.

        A holographic will duly executed and probated under the laws of Louisiana and sufficient in that state to pass the title to realty was entitled to reprobate in Tennessee and was sufficient to pass the title to realty in this state although it did not meet the requirements of this section.

        A will written by the testator's own hand, although not signed by him, nor attested by witnesses, is good as to personalty, provided the handwriting be sufficiently proved to be his. Suggett v. Kitchell, 14 Tenn. 424, 14 Tenn. 425, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1834); Reagan v. Stanley, 79 Tenn. 316, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Apr. 1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        An entry in a continuous diary, written by the party himself, purporting to make a disposition of his property after death, may be probated as a will of personalty, although not signed nor attested, if the handwriting be sufficiently proved. Reagan v. Stanley, 79 Tenn. 316, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Apr. 1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        An unattested testamentary paper, though not found among testator's valuable papers or lodged with another for safekeeping, may be admitted to probate as a will of personalty, without other proof of its writing or publication than the testimony of two witnesses showing the body and signature of the instrument to be in the handwriting of the alleged testator.

        Where a testator died in Italy, and his will was drafted presumably in his own handwriting, and testator's handwriting was not proved by three or more witnesses, the probate court of a county in Tennessee properly admitted the will to probate as decedent's holographic will, and limited it to the disposal of personal property. In re De Franceschi's Estate, 17 Tenn. App. 673, 70 S.W.2d 513, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

        This section does not apply to dispositions of personalty, which are governed by the common law. Druen v. Hudson, 17 Tenn. App. 428, 68 S.W.2d 146, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

       <p>
        Where the standards of proof set out in this section are not met, a holographic will is properly limited to the disposition of personal property. In re De Franceschi's Estate, 17 Tenn. App. 673, 70 S.W.2d 513, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

        An instrument which was not sufficient as a holographic will to pass title to land because it was not found among the valuable papers of the decedent or lodged in the hands of another for safekeeping could nevertheless operate to pass personalty. Fransioli v. Podesta, 175 Tenn. 340, 134 S.W.2d 162, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1939).

        Where the original probate record of a holographic will was insufficient as to realty, but sufficient as to personalty, a reprobate thereof made 19 years thereafter, upon motion in an ex parte proceeding, without petition or notice as required for probate in solemn form, but with all the formalities required to probate a holographic will as to land, is sufficient to make out a prima facie case in favor of a beneficiary under the will, and the burden of proving the invalidity of the will for fraud, accident, or mistake, devolved upon those asserting it. The right to reprobate the will was not barred by the lapse of time. Grier v. Canada, 119 Tenn. 17, 107 S.W. 970, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1907); Scott v. Wagstaff, 120 Tenn. 252, 107 S.W. 976, 1907 Tenn.

       <p>
        Where on a former appeal it was held that an instrument was not sufficient to pass realty as a holographic will because it was not found among the valuable papers of the decedent but its effectiveness as a will of personalty was not decided, the question of the validity of the instrument as a will of personalty was not res judicata even though the court could have determined such question on the first appeal. Fransioli v. Podesta, 175 Tenn. 340, 134 S.W.2d 162, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1939).

         Will alterations made by testator were sufficient to revoke provision bequeathing stocks, bonds, and cash where the testator enclosed the provision in parenthesis, underlined the provision, wrote “void” above the provision, and signed his initials.

         There was insufficient evidence to support that the decedent made the markings on the will or that he intended to revoke those portions of the will, much less a revocation of the entire will, because the decedent had not destroyed the last will and testament or written anything on it to reflect that he intended to revoke his last will and testament, nor had he executed a subsequent document revoking the January 2018 will; and no evidence was presented of any individual witnessing the decedent make any markings on the will, of any person identifying the markings on the will as those of the decedent, or concerning whether the decedent made comments prior to his death regarding revision of his will.

         Where a widow filed a declaratory judgment petition with a third codicil that was previously undiscovered attached, prior to the trial court entering an order admitting the will and the first two codicils to probate in solemn form, the trial court had an obligation to bring the proceedings to a halt and conduct an inquiry into whether the widow had standing to pursue a will contest under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c04s32-4-101" target="_self">32-4-101</a></cite> and not doing so was reversible error. The third codicil, if admitted to probate, would undoubtedly have operated as a partial revocation of the earlier will and codicils under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-201ol11" target="_self">32-1-201(1)</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c01s32-1-101ol12" target="_self">32-1-101(2)</a></cite>.

        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court erred by interpreting the court's earlier opinion as conclusively deciding that the testator's third codicil had not been revoked, had been lost or destroyed, and that the contents were the same as the contents of the purported copy, and therefore the trial court erred by granting the widow summary judgment under the law of the case doctrine; rather, the court's prior opinion stated that nothing in its opinion prevented the testator's daughters from also contesting the will and all three codicils if that was their desire, and on remand the trial court was to require the daughters to state whether they were contesting the testator's will or any of the codicils, and if so, the basis for their contest.

       The statutes make it clear that the county court is the probate court. The 1978 constitutional amendments superseded this court. Viewed realistically the probate court is just as much a part of our judicial system as the juvenile court. Probate judges are county officers. Marion County Bd. of Comm'rs v.

       In a case arising from the distribution of settlement proceeds in which the children of the deceased argued that the settlement proceeds should be distributed in accordance with a document that they propounded was the deceased's will, since that will had not been probated, it had not legal effect. Additionally, since there was no estate opened and no will admitted to probate, the proceeds of the personal injury action passed in accordance with the laws on intestate succession. Timmins v.

       Where an elderly person left the county of her general residence and went to live with relatives in a second county where she died, probate could have been accomplished in either county.

       Probate court had subject matter jurisdiction over the decedent's estate because the decedent was domiciled in Tennessee as weeks before the decedent's death, the decedent moved from Pennsylvania into an assisted living facility in Tennessee to be near one of the decedent's children.

       A will is proved in common form when the executor presents it before the court, and, without the citation and presence of the parties interested, produces a witness or witnesses to prove the same, who testify by their oaths that the testament exhibited is the true, whole, and last will and testament of the deceased, and the judge thereupon, and sometimes with less proof, annexes his probate and seal thereto.

       The probate of a will in common form, unappealed from, and not revoked or vacated, is conclusive until it is finally set aside by the final decision in favor of the contestants in a contest successfully prosecuted by them upon the issue of devisavit vel non. Until so set aside, such probate is conclusive of the testamentary capacity of the testator and of the testamentary character and due execution of the instrument, and is even conclusive as against all questions of fraud, impositions, and undue influence in procuring its execution.

       The probate of a will in solemn form, upon notice to the interested parties or by final judgment upon the issue of devisavit vel non rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in a contested will case, in which the executor or some of the parties interested in maintaining the will and some of the parties interested in setting the will aside are adverse parties to the record, is conclusive upon all parties in interest, whether parties to the record or not, unless it can be impeached upon the ground that it was procured by fraud or collusion, as other judgments and decrees. This rule is based upon the principle that the probate of wills is in the nature of a proceeding in rem, and binding on all persons in interest. Hodges v. Bauchman, 16 Tenn. 186, 1835 Tenn.

       The county court (now probate court) cannot, at a subsequent term, set aside, absolutely and unconditionally, the probate of a will in common form. The order of the county court (now probate court) setting aside the probate of a will in common form, in order that the same may be contested in the circuit court, has the legal effect only to suspend the probate in common form and to suspend the rights under the will during the pendency of the trial of the issue of devisavit vel non, and is only revoked, absolutely, by a final decision in favor of the contestants. A withdrawal of the contest in the circuit court revives the probate in common form. The administration of the estate may proceed pending the contest in the circuit court, except that the interests of the parties under the will and in the estate must be preserved. Burrow v.

       If the will has been probated in common form, the court may, upon the petition of any party that would have been substantially interested in the estate in case of intestacy of the decedent and alleged testator, and after the citation of the executor to appear and defend, transfer the will to the circuit court, to be proved in solemn form, on the issue of devisavit vel non; but inasmuch as it is not a matter of course to set aside the probate in common form, the court may refuse to do so and may refuse such transfer.

       Under this section no particular form of pleading is required in making up an issue of devisavit vel non.

       Where notice of contest is entered by one “interested” and the proceeding is certified to circuit court the death of one of the contestants does not deprive circuit court of jurisdiction, since proceeding in circuit court is a proceeding in rem involving the distribution of the res the estate, hence the proceeding must continue until the instrument propounded is either admitted to probate or rejected.

       Because a witness to a purported will did not testify at the will contest, in the absence of a finding by the trial court on whether the witness was “to be found,” the court of appeals was unable to determine whether the statute's requirements were met and was unable to effectively review the decision; the statute required the proponent to either submit the testimony of all living witnesses to the alleged will or show that a living witness whose testimony is not proffered is not “to be found.” In re Estate of Woolverton, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn.

       It is mandatory for all attesting witnesses if they are found and available for testimony to be produced by the proponents of the will in all cases contesting the validity of will. Swindoll v. Jones, 41 Tenn. App. 89, 292 S.W.2d 531, 1954 Tenn. App. LEXIS 173 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1954).

       Trial court did not err in declining to consider the purported affidavit as sufficient evidence that the signature requirements of the will had been met because there was no dispute that the witnesses did not personally appear before the notary for purposes of notarizing any affidavit; and the notary had no conversations with either witness regarding the documents or the authenticity of the signatures and no oath was ever administered; thus, the purported affidavit was not executed in strict compliance with the statutory requirement that they be made and signed before any officer authorized to administer oaths in or out of the State of Tennessee.

       In a chancery suit by the state for the escheat of property, real and personal, alleged to have been disposed of by will probated in common form, the court has jurisdiction of the question whether the will was procured by fraud or by undue influence from a person of unsound mind, and if the will is found to have been thus procured, it may be declared ineffective as to the property in controversy, and all the rights pertaining to the property and persons involved may be adjudicated upon the merits in such suit, without directing a contest to be made in the regular course, by petition in the county court (now probate court) and by its certification to the circuit court, to be conducted and determined in the regular way. However, the chancery suit may itself be stayed until the contest is instituted and prosecuted in the regular way, if that course be sought in the bill. State v.

       Statutes are separate and distinct, and while the witness signatures required by one statute are mandatory for proper execution, the affidavit contemplated by the other statute is permissive, and serves a separate function distinct from execution.

       Affidavit was inaccurate because the witnesses did not sign the “foregoing” will, they only signed the affidavit and their signatures did not appear anywhere else in the document, and because the affidavit referred to the will as a “foregoing” document, it could not be concluded that the affidavit was part of the will so as to have satisfied statutory will execution requirements; thus, the decedent died intestate. In re Estate of Morris, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 62 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 524 (Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in declining to consider the purported affidavit as sufficient evidence that the signature requirements of the will had been met because there was no dispute that the witnesses did not personally appear before the notary for purposes of notarizing any affidavit; and the notary had no conversations with either witness regarding the documents or the authenticity of the signatures and no oath was ever administered; thus, the purported affidavit was not executed in strict compliance with the statutory requirement that they be made and signed before any officer authorized to administer oaths in or out of the State of Tennessee.

      <p>
       This statute, as applied to wills made before its passage where the testator died afterwards, though retrospective, was not unconstitutional, because it did not impair the obligation of contracts and did not divest, impair, or disturb vested rights, in violation of the constitutional prohibition (Tenn. Const., art. I, § 20) against the enactment of retrospective or other laws impairing the obligation of contracts. Wynne's Lessee v. Wynne, 32 Tenn. 405, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1852); Gardenhire v.

       While the construction of a will requires a consideration of the facts and circumstances at the time of its execution and every word is presumed to have some meaning, the will must take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator. Bell v. Shannon, 212 Tenn. 28, 367 S.W.2d 761, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 396 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Phrase “all my personal property” in will included cash on hand and in checking and savings accounts, even though will also contained direction to sell personal property and convert it to cash, since “all” is inclusive and embraces all such property unless excepted by descriptive words. Cobb v. Stewart, 225 Tenn. 85, 463 S.W.2d 693, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 280, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In most jurisdictions, if a will's language creates a certain estate when the will is executed, but the law later changes so that the same language would pass a different estate, the law in force when the will was made governs unless the language of the will makes it clear that the testator intended differently; however, it appears Tennessee does not follow this rule.

       Provision in will disposing of shares of stock in “Independent Theatres, Inc.” “owned by me at the time of my death” was held to mean the stock in a corporation so named which was formed after the execution of the will, notwithstanding that there was a corporation in existence named “Independent Theatres, Incorporated” in which the testator owned shares at the time of the execution of the will, therefore the shares of stock in “Independent Theatres, Inc.” would be disposed of according to such provision and not according to the residuary clause.

       This section cannot be construed to mean that a will passes title to property devised or bequeathed thereby prior to the death of the testator, but means that as to property comprised in the will, it is to take effect as if executed immediately before death, unless a contrary intention appears.

       The fact that a testator after executing his will conveyed his property to the principal beneficiaries which property they later reconveyed back to the testator would not operate to revoke the will since a will takes effect as of the death of the testator.

       As a general rule the subsequent marriage and birth of children to a testator are sufficient change in his circumstances to revoke his prior will, and a subsequent divorce and property settlement may also revoke a prior will insofar as the latter provides for the former spouse, but both rules are subject to exceptions or changed circumstances which make their operation unjust or improper.

      <p>
       A devise, which never became effective because the devisee renounced it, stands in the category of a lapsed or void devise; and, in such case, the land covered passes under the residuary clause, if there be one; and, in the absence of such clause, such land goes to the heirs of the testator. Strong v. Ready, 28 Tenn. 168, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1848); Bradford v. Leake, 124 Tenn. 312, 137 S.W. 96, 1912D Am. Ann. Cas. 1140, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1910).

      <p>
       Since this statute altering the former law, a special exception of certain land from a residuary devise for the purpose of giving it to another devisee, will not prevent the excepted land from going to the residuary devisee, if the excepting and specific devise fails by an event analogous to a lapse, or in consequence of indefiniteness, or because void, when the whole will shows that the land was excepted out of the residuum for the purpose of giving it to the specific devisee, and not in order to take it away from the residuary devisee. Reeves v. Reeves, 73 Tenn. 644, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 195 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this statute, lapsed devises and void devises pass under the general residuary clause to the residuary devisee. This statute removed the distinction between real and personal estate in this particular, and harmonized the testamentary disposition of both. Reeves v. Reeves, 73 Tenn. 644, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 195 (1880); Fite v. Beasley, 80 Tenn. 328, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 176 (1883); Johnson v. Johnson, 92 Tenn. 559, 23 S.W. 114, 1893 Tenn.

      <p>
       A general residuary bequest carries to the residuary legatee not only such of the testator's property as he did not attempt to dispose of by will but also such as was not effectively disposed of thereby. Fehringer v. Fehringer, 222 Tenn. 585, 439 S.W.2d 258, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 465 (1969).

       Where testatrix conveyed her home to the devisee “to live in and not to be sold,” testatrix's will passed a fee simple absolute in the home to the devisee, and the attempted restraint on alienation was void as inconsistent with the incidents and nature of the estate devised and contrary to public policy.

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The common law presumption against partial intestacy, codified in this section, is applicable when the words used, by any fair interpretation, will embrace the property not otherwise devised, unless a contrary intention appears from the context. McDonald v. Ledford, 140 Tenn. 471, 205 S.W. 312, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption against any partial intestacy when a decedent dies testate applies only in the absence of a contrary intent and when the words used will fairly embrace the property not otherwise devised. In re Estate of Dye, 565 S.W.2d 219, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 275 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule against partial intestacy operates to prevent testamentary gifts from lapsing or failing through the incomplete drafting of a will. In re Will of Tipler, 10 S.W.3d 244, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 841 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Presumption against intestacy will not pass property not named in a will, which contains only devises and bequests of specified property, where there are no contextual words to contrary. Bynum v. McDowell, 3 Tenn. App. 340, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The cardinal rule in construction of all wills is that the court shall seek to discover the intention of the testator and give effect to it, unless it contravenes some rule of law or public policy. That intention is to be ascertained from the particular words used, from the context, and from the general scope and purpose of the will, read in the light of the surrounding and attending circumstances. Mongle v. Summers, 592 S.W.2d 594, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption against intestacy is not sufficient to convert a life estate in a former spouse into a fee simple. In re Walker, 849 S.W.2d 766, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 71 (Tenn. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent created a holographic will, containing a clause that provided: If I do not have sufficient funds to give each person the amounts I listed, the amounts as corrected can be adjusted up or down by considering each part a percentage of the entire total estate available after expenses of settling, the probate court erred by construing the language as a residuary clause; on review, the appellate court held that decedent died intestate as to the excess personal property not specifically devised in her will; accordingly, her sister's children inherited a residence not provided for in the will by intestate succession. In re Estate of Milam, 181 S.W.3d 344, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Oct. 3, 2005).

       Construction of a will is not a proper issue in probate proceedings. Jones v. Jones, 163 Tenn. 237, 43 S.W.2d 205, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1931); Condry v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where will was not clear as to whether property was bequeathed to dog or whether private trust was established for care of animal, the matter of construction of the will was not a proper matter for probate proceedings.

       In the absence of an intent to the contrary, the word “issue” does not include a child adopted after the death of the testator. Banovic v. Davis, 642 S.W.2d 153, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 426 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982), superseded by statute as stated in, Calhoun v. Campbell, 763 S.W.2d 744, 1988 Tenn. LEXIS 270 (Tenn. 1988).

      <p>
       The validity of a joint will was not destroyed by the fact that the testators devised their property to a third person subject only to a life estate in the survivor. Beach v. Cobble, 36 Tenn. App. 693, 260 S.W.2d 212, 1952 Tenn. App. LEXIS 141 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1952).

      </p>

       Where the intent of the testators is determined, the use of inept words or errors in grammar and punctuation will not vary, change or alter that intent. Mongle v. Summers, 592 S.W.2d 594, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

      <p>
       A change of beneficiary, which right is reserved in life insurance policy, operates as an ademption or revocation pro tanto of a previously executed will which purported to dispose of the proceeds of such life insurance policy. Minnesota Life Ins. Co. v. Allen, 55 Tenn. App. 405, 401 S.W.2d 589, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 259 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a legacy provided for 50 shares of a specific bank stock to a church, the sale of that stock by the testatrix prior to death resulted in a revocation of that legacy. Price v. Johnson, 563 S.W.2d 188, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 267 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The doctrine of facts of independent significance was applicable to permit testatrix's holographic codicil to refer to husband's will, despite the fact that the will was not in existence when the codicil was executed, provided the document was a valid holographic codicil. In re Will of Tipler, 10 S.W.3d 244, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 841 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       To determine whether holographic codicil contained all material provisions in testatrix's handwriting, the trial court properly considered testatrix's intent. In re Will of Tipler, 10 S.W.3d 244, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 841 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).

       Where the beneficiaries predeceased the testatrix and died without issue, the Tennessee anti-lapse statute was not applicable. The probate court correctly applied the Ford rule and concluded that the lapsed gifts created a partial intestacy; the lapsed gifts passed to the heirs at law.

       The word “estate” is used in this section in its technical sense as having reference to the nature of the testator's interest in the property, that is, as to whether it is a fee simple or a lesser estate, and not with reference to the extent of the testator's ownership of the corpus, that is, as to whether he owned the whole property or merely an undivided interest therein. Nichols v. Todd, 20 Tenn. App. 564, 101 S.W.2d 486, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 48 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

       The rule that an heir is not to be disinherited except by express words or necessary implication will be invoked to defeat the presumption that a testator intends to dispose of his entire estate, and not to die intestate. Nichols v. Todd, 20 Tenn. App. 564, 101 S.W.2d 486, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 48 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

       A devise to one, without the addition of the words “his heirs and assigns forever,” must be deemed to be a devise in fee simple, unless by some part of the will it appears that the testator intended to convey an estate of less dignity. Booker v. Booker, 24 Tenn. 505, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1844); King v. Miller, 79 Tenn. 633, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1883); Anderson v. Lucas, 140 Tenn. 336, 204 S.W. 989, 1918 Tenn.

Anderson v. Lucas, 140 Tenn. 336, 204 S.W. 989, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1918), overruled in part, Harris v. Bittikofer, 541 S.W.2d 372, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. 1976).

       Where a will, providing for the payment of debts and for a number of general pecuniary legacies, contained no residuary clause and made no mention of the real estate in question, the testator died intestate as to such realty, and it descended to his heir at law.

       Presumption is that a testator did not intend to die partially intestate. McDonald v. Ledford, 140 Tenn. 471, 205 S.W. 312, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1918); Maynor v. Vaughn, 159 Tenn. 281, 17 S.W.2d 910, 1928 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a presumption that a testator intends to dispose of his entire estate, and not to die intestate, either as to the whole or any part thereof, or interest therein; however this presumption yields when it conflicts with the rule that an heir is not to be disinherited except by express words or necessary implication. Nichols v. Todd, 20 Tenn. App. 564, 101 S.W.2d 486, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 48 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
      </p>

       Will by uneducated man in his own handwriting which “I want my wife … to then take in her perseson the remainder of all of my property boath real and personal and use as her own for her surpoard in any way that her needs require until her death” vested the fee in the widow. Cannon v. Cannon, 182 Tenn. 1, 184 S.W.2d 35, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 294 (1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common law presumption against partial intestacy, codified in this section, is applicable where the words used, by any fair interpretation, will embrace the property not otherwise devised unless a contrary intention appears from the context.

       The mere pretermission or omission of an after-born child in a will does not, without more, warrant inference of disinheritance, for to say that it did would be to say that the words “nor disinherited” in the provision are superfluous.

       Where will was made eight months before the birth of the child and eight years before testator's death, the intent to exclude was apparent. Fleming v. Phoenix Trust Co., 162 Tenn. 511, 39 S.W.2d 277, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Birth of a child about four months after testatrix made her will in which there was no mention of the prospective child or her pregnancy, failure to make provision therefor thereafter, keeping will among testatrix's papers, until her death about 12 years thereafter, and fact that the child was only child of testatrix and her wealthy husband showed intention to disinherit child born after the will was made. King v. King, 166 Tenn. 115, 59 S.W.2d 510, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       The will of a father which included no mention of an after-adopted child was sufficient when considered with the facts that the will was drawn two days before the child's adoption, that the father's estate was heavily encumbered and that the father did not change the will in the three years before he died, for the court to conclude that the father intended to disinherit the adopted child.

       Where will of widower executed two years prior to second marriage named all of the then living children but failed to mention unborn children or indicate any contemplated marriage at time of execution, the will remaining in hands of draftsman until death of testator, children of second marriage were entitled to share in estate as pretermitted children.

       A married woman's will, giving her entire estate to her husband, provided he survived her, otherwise, to her bodily heirs, where she then had one or more children, operates to disinherit her child born after its execution. The disinheritance of the after-born child need not be express, but may result from an unavoidable inference. Reaves v. Hager, 101 Tenn. 712, 50 S.W. 760, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1899).

       Alleged heir was not born subsequent to the execution of the will, and the legislature expressed no intent to attach a liberal construction to the word “born”; the heir was disinherited by implication where the decedent, if fully aware of his relationship to the heir, made no effort to adopt or formally to legitimate her after the execution of his will, as disinheritance by implication was established.

       A deed to a divorced wife, reciting that it was given to her “in settlement of all demands for support of child,” is not such settlement on a posthumous child as will prevent it from inheriting under this section, especially where the decree of divorce had previously settled the same property on the wife, with a provision that it should not be construed, accepted, or taken in any way “to militate against the rights of the yet unborn child” of such wife.

       Where the devisee or legatee dies before the death of the testator, and leaves no issue surviving the testator, this statute is inapplicable; and the devise or legacy lapses, as it did before this statute.

       Where the devisee or legatee predeceases the testator, and leaves no issue that survives the testator, the devise or legacy is not saved from lapsing because the devisee or legatee had, by will, disposed of his such expectant estate, and the original testator, knowing of this disposition by such probated will, did not recall the devise or legacy, for this statute has no application in such case. Dixon v. Cooper, 88 Tenn. 177, 12 S.W. 445, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1889), superseded by statute as stated in, Jacobsen v. Flathe, — S.W.2d —, 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 635 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 17, 1997).

       Where there is an immediate gift to a devisee or legatee, and a gift over in case of the death without issue of the devisee or legatee, the gift overtakes effect only if the devisee or legatee predeceases testator, in the absence of a contrary intention clearly indicated in the will and codicil.

       Where the disposition of devised property is preceded by a prior estate for life or years, a gift over in case of the death of the devisee without issue takes effect only if the death occurs during the period of the intervening estate, in the absence of a contrary intention expressed in the will.

       The proceedings are not according to those in equity or at law, but to those in the English ecclesiastical courts, as far as same are applicable under modern conditions. Lillard v. Tolliver, 154 Tenn. 304, 285 S.W. 576, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       A contest of a will is an attempt by legal proceeding to show that the testator was incapable of making a will or that the instrument is the will of another by reason of undue influence, to the end that the will may be declared void and the estate be administered according to the laws of descent and distribution. Clark v. Hefley, 34 Tenn. App. 389, 238 S.W.2d 513, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 154 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeding in circuit court on issue of devisavit vel non is in substance an original proceeding to probate a will. Curry v. Bridges, 45 Tenn. App. 395, 325 S.W.2d 87, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959); Arnold v. Marcom, 49 Tenn. App. 161, 352 S.W.2d 936, 1961 Tenn. App. LEXIS 102 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1961); Bearman v. Camatsos, 215 Tenn. 231, 385 S.W.2d 91, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 557 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is commonly referred to as a will contest, the trial of an issue of devisavit vel non in the circuit court is an original proceeding to probate a will and the form of action is sui generis and strictly in rem being derived not from the common law but from the Ecclesiastical Courts of England. Arnold v. Marcom, 49 Tenn. App. 161, 352 S.W.2d 936, 1961 Tenn. App. LEXIS 102 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1961).

        4. Setting Aside Probate in Common Form.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The mode and practice in setting aside a common form probate, which has been adopted by the courts, is to require a petition to be filed by the proposed contestant stating the grounds of the contest and the petitioner's interest in the matter. Gibson v. Lane, 17 Tenn. 475, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 89 (1836); Cornwell v. Cornwell, 30 Tenn. 485, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1850); Keith v. Raglan, 41 Tenn. 474, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1860); Miller v. Miller, 52 Tenn. 723, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a matter of course to set aside the probate of a will made in common form, and to transfer the will to the circuit court to be reprobated in solemn form on the issue of devisavit vel non. Wynne v. Spiers, 26 Tenn. 394, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1846); Cornwell v. Cornwell, 30 Tenn. 485, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1850); Ligon v. Hawkes, 110 Tenn. 514, 75 S.W. 1072, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will has been probated in common form and recorded, the statute prescribes no mode whatever for setting aside such probate by requiring it to be repropounded for probate in solemn form and its validity investigated in an issue of devisavit vel non. Wynne v. Spiers, 26 Tenn. 394, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1846); Miller v. Miller, 52 Tenn. 723, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a will has been probated in solemn form no question as to its validity can thereafter be raised except to set aside the judgment due to fraud in its procurement. Stacks v. Saunders, 812 S.W.2d 587, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 904 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The petition to set aside the common form probate of a will must state the interest of the petitioner, and must state the facts upon which the contest is to be made. The executor should be cited or summoned, and should answer or demur to the petition. Special pleas complicating and confusing the issues should not be allowed in the probate court. Burrow v. Ragland, 25 Tenn. 481, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1846); Cornwell v. Cornwell, 30 Tenn. 485, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1850); Miller v. Miller, 52 Tenn. 723, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is required that the petition be verified by affidavit; but it is too late to make objection, for the first time, by motion in the circuit court, to dismiss it for the want of an affidavit. Keith v. Raglan, 41 Tenn. 474, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1860).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The right of a proposed contestant to impeach or contest a will, or to set aside the common form probate if the right be disputed, presents a distinct controversy separate from and preliminary to the contest itself, constituting the corpus of a legal contestation, proper to be settled finally, upon the issue and evidence, before the issue of devisavit vel non is tried, and such preliminary question does not incorporate itself with the subsequent contest proceeding, if one should take place, and must be distinctly disposed of, and an appeal lies from a decision thereof, before the contest is heard. Wynne v. Spiers, 26 Tenn. 394, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1846); Keith v. Raglan, 41 Tenn. 474, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1860); Townsend v. Bonner, 1 Shan. 197 (1869); Crocker v. Balch, 104 Tenn. 6, 55 S.W. 307, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1900); Cowan v. Walker, 117 Tenn. 135, 96 S.W. 967, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1906); Shaller v. Garrett, 127 Tenn. 665, 156 S.W. 1084, 1913 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the proponent of a will, upon petition of one to contest as heir of the decedent, alleges the illegitimacy of such contestant, the determination of such contestant's right to contest as such heir is the initial inquiry, separate from and preliminary to the contest itself. Napier v. Church, 132 Tenn. 111, 177 S.W. 56, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1915).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The chancery court has jurisdiction to set aside the probate of a will in common form for fraud, or upon other equitable grounds, and may direct a suit to test the validity of the will upon a trial of the issue of devisavit vel non, to be instituted by petition in the probate court and to be certified to the circuit court for trial in the regular way, but cannot send the case directly to the circuit court for trial. It may also set aside a probate in solemn form, for fraud in its procurement. Burrow v. Ragland, 25 Tenn. 481, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1846); John v. Tate, 26 Tenn. 388, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1846); Ford v. Ford, 42 Tenn. 74, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1865); Townsend v. Townsend, 44 Tenn. 70, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1867); Smith v. Harrison, 49 Tenn. 230, 1871 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       The legal effect of the chancery decree setting aside judgment against validity of a will, procured upon trial of the issue of devisavit vel non, is to restore the original probate in common form in all its vigor. John v. Tate, 26 Tenn. 388, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1846); Smith v. Harrison, 49 Tenn. 230, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court, upon setting aside judgment in contested will case for fraud, will take cognizance of the factum of the will itself, in adjusting the equities of the parties to determine whether their equities demand a retrial at law or a reinstatement of the former probate in common form, but not to determine the validity of the will itself. Smith v. Harrison, 49 Tenn. 230, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the chancery court, part 1, had jurisdiction to remand the case to the probate court for a determination of the standing issue, it logically followed that the probate court had jurisdiction, on remand, to address the issue of the children's standing; the placing of the designation of “part 1” on a probate court and memorandum opinion was nothing more than an oversight, and the chancellor who presided over the probate court signed both the order and memorandum opinion. Jolley v. Henderson, 154 S.W.3d 538, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 408 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 1136 (Tenn. Dec. 20, 2004).

       Chancery court properly dismissed a daughter's complaint to contest her father's will because, while the complaint was timely filed and the court had subject matter jurisdiction, the daughter, an unnamed heir in a prior will contest filed by another daughter, could not institute a second will contest, her complaint was not an amendment to the other will contest, and she did not have to be made a party to the prior proceeding in order for the trial court to determine the validity of the will. In re Estate of Sutton, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 805 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 17, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (Tenn. May 15, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court properly granted an executor's motion to dismiss a contestant's second will contest with prejudice because the Supreme Court of Tennessee had held that when a chancery court served as the probate court for the county, it could simply assume jurisdiction and that no formal certification was required, the contestant's voluntary nonsuit of his first will contest had the legal effect of dismissing the will contest and did not allow the institution of a second will contest.

       The circuit court can acquire jurisdiction only in one way, that is, by a certificate from the probate court that the validity of the will is contested, such probate court being the custodian of the will and having had original jurisdiction of its probate. Simmons v. Leonard, 89 Tenn. 622, 15 S.W. 444, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1891).

       Circuit court had jurisdiction of contest notwithstanding the fact that upon appeal from probate court to circuit court the case was not certified for trial on issue of devisavit vel non in the circuit court, the jurisdiction of the circuit court attaching ipso facto where a contest existed.

       Although the proponents of a purported last will by the decedent contended that the probate court erred in certifying all the testamentary instruments to the circuit court when only the purported last will had been admitted to probate, the trial court did not err in certifying all of the testamentary documents at issue to the circuit court for adjudication in the will contest because the court was then able to decide how the decedent's estate was to be distributed.

       The probate of a will, made in common form, will only be set aside at the instance of the party interested as heir or distributee or otherwise, in the decedent's estate in case of intestacy, who was not cited to be present at the first probate. Neither strangers or kinsmen who are not heirs or next of kin, or distributees, will be permitted to disturb the existing probate in common form. Wynne v. Spiers, 26 Tenn. 394, 1846 Tenn.

       The father and only heir of the testator's motherless granddaughter, being a stranger in blood and estate, and being wholly incapable of inheriting from the testator, even if his daughter, the testator's granddaughter had died before the testator, has no interest, by reason of the death of his such daughter after the death of the testator, as would entitle him to have the probate in common form set aside, or to question the testamentary capacity of the testator. The right to contest a will is not a property right, and it will not pass by inheritance or descent to strangers in blood and estate to the testator. Ligon v.

Bennet v. Bradford, 41 Tenn. 471, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1860); Bowden v. Higgs, 77 Tenn. 343, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1882); Douglass v. Baber, 83 Tenn. 651, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1885); Lassiter v.

       Where a will was procured by fraud and undue influence, and the executrix who propounded it for probate was the chief beneficiary, and was responsible for the fraud, she is not entitled to costs. Smith v. Haire, 133 Tenn. 343, 181 S.W. 161, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1915).

       Attorney fees incurred by an executor in propounding a will may be paid out of the estate as expenses of administration, unless the executor in propounding the will was not acting in good faith. Smith v. Haire, 138 Tenn. 255, 197 S.W. 678, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1917).

       An executor who in good faith propounds will for probate is entitled to costs and attorney fees, whether the will is set aside on contest or not. But where the will was procured by fraud and undue influence of the executor who was the chief beneficiary, he is not entitled to costs. Smith v. Haire, 133 Tenn. 343, 181 S.W. 161, 1915 Tenn.

       Where in litigation between husband and wife concerning her property (including land), a compromise was effected whereby he conveyed a certain portion of the property to trustees of the wife, with the absolute right vested in her to dispose of her estate by will, or otherwise, the husband was thereby estopped to dispute the validity of the wife's will. Wynne v. Spiers, 26 Tenn. 394, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1846); Miller v. Miller, 52 Tenn. 723, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (1871).

       Neither the fact that the widow may dissent from her deceased husband's will and thereby share in his estate as in case of his intestacy, nor the fact that she has actually so dissented, and has had a year's support assigned to her, nor the fact that she asked the appointment of one person, rather than another, as administrator with the will annexed, estops her to contest the validity of such will. Miller v. Miller, 52 Tenn. 723, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (1871); Moore v. Johnson, 75 Tenn. 580, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1881).
      </p>

       The election of the widow to take under her husband's will does not estop her from afterwards contesting the will, because there can be no valid election if there was no valid will. Moore v. Johnson, 75 Tenn. 580, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1881).

       The heir is estopped to contest the will where he had, for a valuable consideration, relinquished to the ancestor and testator his entire expectancy in the latter's estate. Gore v.

       Parties who prosecuted to final judgment a suit to construe the will and decree rights thereunder, admit its validity and are estopped to contest for fraud and undue influence. But as to an infant, a next friend had no right so to elect to take under a will rather than to contest it as invalid, or to waive or admit away any substantial right. Hodges v. Hale, 20 Tenn.

       Proponent in will contest was not estopped from challenging jurisdiction of circuit court where she applied to that court, while the case was pending in the probate court and before it was certified to the circuit court, for a writ of certiorari and supersedeas to have stayed an order of the probate court requiring the production of certain privileged matter, the petition in that case having nothing to do with the issue of devisavit vel non and being in the nature of an independent proceeding.

       An appeal lies from a decision upon the question whether the proposed contestant of a will is entitled to make the contest when the will is originally presented for probate, or upon petition to set aside a probate in common form and to have the will certified, and either unsuccessful party is entitled to an appeal or writ of error, from the probate court's final decision in the matter, to the circuit court, and from that court to the court of appeals, and by certiorari from the latter court to the Supreme Court. Howell v. Whitchurch, 5 Tenn. 49, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1817); Johnson v. Gains, 41 Tenn. 288, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1860); Keith v. Raglan, 41 Tenn. 474, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1860); Cowan v. Walker, 117 Tenn. 135, 96 S.W. 967, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the petitioner is not entitled to have the probate of a will, made in common form, set aside and to have the will certified, and the decision of the circuit court is reversed, the Supreme Court will, without remandment, render proper judgment dismissing the petition, where the circuit judge should have rendered such judgment.

       No particular form of pleading is required in making up the issue of devisavit vel non, for all that is required is that the party propounding the paper shall affirm it to be the testator's will, and the contesting party shall deny it. Ford v. Ford, 26 Tenn. 92, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1846); Harrison v. Morton, 32 Tenn. 461, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1852).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issues are made up in the office of the circuit court clerk under the court's direction. Bowman v. Helton, 7 Tenn. App. 325, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 47 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Original statement of issues to jury and the subsequent filing of a declaration and written pleas was a sufficient compliance with this section which simply delineates the practice fixing no hard and fast rule that must be strictly conformed to at the risk of fatal error. In re Estate of Rhodes, 222 Tenn. 394, 436 S.W.2d 429, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 440 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred by interpreting the court's earlier opinion as conclusively deciding that the testator's third codicil had not been revoked, had been lost or destroyed, and that the contents were the same as the contents of the purported copy, and therefore the trial court erred by granting the widow summary judgment under the law of the case doctrine; rather, the court's prior opinion stated that nothing in its opinion prevented the testator's daughters from also contesting the will and all three codicils if that was their desire, and on remand the trial court was to require the daughters to state whether they were contesting the testator's will or any of the codicils, and if so, the basis for their contest. In re Estate of Boote, 265 S.W.3d 402, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 818 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 384 (Tenn. May 27, 2008).

      <p>
       Contest in circuit court should not be upon the issues made by the petition and answer thereto filed in the probate court. Bowman v. Helton, 7 Tenn. App. 325, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 47 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       In case involving presence of animus testandi in holographic will, the issues to be tried in the circuit court are not made by the petition and the answer thereto filed in the probate court, but are made up under the direction of the court after the case has reached the former tribunal. Smith v. Smith, 33 Tenn. App. 507, 232 S.W.2d 338, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 133 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).
      </p>

        4. —Defenses and Judgment Under General Issue.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Such general issue lets in all matters of defense, and under it the will may be sustained in part and set aside in part. Harrison v. Morton, 32 Tenn. 461, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1852).

        5. —Special Pleas.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where the contestant attacks the will only in part, he may do so by a special plea or pleas, if he wishes, with a view of saving costs, or for any other reason; but if he pleads the general issue, special pleas become unnecessary, and it is not error to strike them out. Harrison v. Morton, 32 Tenn. 461, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1852).
      </p>

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where several alleged wills and codicils of the same testator are offered and contested in the circuit court, it is not improper or erroneous for the trial judge to direct a consolidation of all the contests and to require proper issues to be formulated, so that it may be determined which was the last will and testament of the testator, or whether any of them was his will; and to this end, the trial judge may direct the removal of controversies in the probate court, by certiorari, to the circuit court. Walker v. Verble, 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 651 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       More than one will may be offered for probate in a will contest. Proceedings for probate of will are under English system in ecclesiastical courts. Lillard v. Tolliver, 154 Tenn. 304, 285 S.W. 576, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two unprobated wills were certified to circuit court for contest and circuit judge within his discretion made primary issue depend on the validity or invalidity of the later instrument, permitting proponent of latter will to open and close was not improper. Williams v. Bridgeford, 53 Tenn. App. 381, 383 S.W.2d 770, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 109 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two wills were offered for probate at substantially the same time and both were certified to the circuit court for contest, it was within the sound discretion of the circuit court as to how the issues were to be framed and matters of procedure in the presentation of the case were also largely in the discretion of the court. Williams v. Bridgeford, 53 Tenn. App. 381, 383 S.W.2d 770, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 109 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).

      <p>
       Under a plea of the general issue contestant could adduce any evidence tending to show that the paper was not a will of the decedent. Haley v. Ogilvie, 2 Tenn. App. 607, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).

        9. —Directed Verdict.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The authority of the trial judge or the appellate court to direct a verdict is the same as it is in those cases within the purview of the constitutional provision. Cude v. Culberson, 30 Tenn. App. 628, 209 S.W.2d 506, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 117 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section was not intended to supplant the general rule that by proceeding to trial voluntarily without objecting to the pleading by motion for judgment thereon or by default of for confessed judgment for lack of pleas a party is deemed to have waived failure to raise, form or join issue properly or at all. In re Estate of Rhodes, 222 Tenn. 394, 436 S.W.2d 429, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 440 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the parties have voluntarily and without objection tried the case as if certain matters were in issue, one party will not be permitted afterward to object that such matters were not properly put in issue by the pleadings, the doctrine of waiver or estoppel being applied. In re Estate of Rhodes, 222 Tenn. 394, 436 S.W.2d 429, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 440 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent's heirs did not file a will contest action, the appellate court would not disturb the decision of the probate court finding that the holographic documents submitted by the estate executor constituted the last will and testament of the decedent; the parties also did not dispute that the heirs would be entitled to a share in the real and personal property in the decedent's estate under the law of intestate succession. In re Estate of Milam, 181 S.W.3d 344, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Oct. 3, 2005).

       In all cases of contested wills, where there are subscribing witnesses, they must be produced, if to be found, within the meaning of this statute; and, if not, evidence of their handwriting must next be resorted to; and where, from the efflux of time or other circumstances, it is shown, upon diligent inquiry, that the handwriting of one or more subscribing witnesses cannot be proved, then proof of the signature of one witness and that of the testator, and lastly, upon failure of proof of the signatures of all of the witnesses, proof of the handwriting of the testator by two witnesses will authorize the paper to be submitted to the jury, upon which they may find the fact of execution. In all cases depending on secondary evidence, the signature of the testator, though not absolutely essential, ought to be superadded to that of the subscribing witnesses. Jones v. Arterburn, 30 Tenn. 97, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires only that all the subscribing witnesses be put on the stand by the proponent of the will, and does not require that each witness shall show affirmatively all the facts necessary to constitute due execution. Wheeler v. Parr, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 374 (1912).

       Under the provisions of this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t32c02s32-2-104" target="_self">32-2-104</a></cite> that a contested will is to be proved by all living witnesses “if to be found,” it is the function of the trial judge to determine whether a witness is available or can be found and where the explanation satisfies not only the trial judge but the contestants as well the requirements have been substantially met. Lyman v. American Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 48 Tenn. App. 328, 346 S.W.2d 289, 1960 Tenn. App. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a witness to a purported will did not testify at the will contest, in the absence of a finding by the trial court on whether the witness was “to be found,” the court of appeals was unable to determine whether the statute's requirements were met and was unable to effectively review the decision; the statute required the proponent to either submit the testimony of all living witnesses to the alleged will or show that a living witness whose testimony is not proffered is not “to be found.” In re Estate of Woolverton, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 36 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 30, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclosure of a first witness and handwritten notes on the eve of trial violated time limits, but trial judges had the discretion to extend the application of such time limits; because Tennessee law required contested wills to be proved by all available living witnesses, counsel had to present some satisfactory evidence that the second witness was not available or able to testify or lose the case on a technicality, to avoid that harsh result, the trial court allowed the first witness to testify initially regarding the second witness's availability, and no abuse of discretion was found. In re Estate of Gertrude Bible Link, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2017), appeal denied, In re Estate of Link, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 450 (Tenn. July 20, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee law required the proponent of a contested will to present the testimony of all living witnesses to the will's execution or demonstrate that they were not available; the testimony reflected that the witness could not consistently produce the words he intended to produce, and thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the witness was not available to testify. In re Estate of Gertrude Bible Link, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2017), appeal denied, In re Estate of Link, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 450 (Tenn. July 20, 2017).

       While the proponent of the will introduced the attesting witnesses, the fact of such introduction does not preclude him from impeaching their testimony, and establishing the will in opposition to their swearing. Jones v. Arterburn, 30 Tenn. 97, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1850); Rose v. Allen, 41 Tenn. 23, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1860); Alexander v. Beadle, 47 Tenn. 126, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1869); Wheeler v.

       While the proponent of the will may impeach and contradict the testimony of the attesting witnesses, the question is reserved whether the rule extends so far as to allow the proponent to impeach their general character. Alexander v. Beadle, 47 Tenn. 126, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1869).

      <p>
       The attesting and subscribing witness to a will, in legal effect, asserts the mental capacity of the testator and the due execution of the will, and certifies to his knowledge of the same, and his swearing against his own act and declarations “shakes his own credibility” and discredits his testimony. Rose v. Allen, 41 Tenn. 23, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1860).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the witness proves that he became a subscribing witness to a will, in the absence of the testator, does not, as a matter of law, impeach his credit and show him unworthy of belief. While the jury may take into consideration the improbability that a witness would attest the will in the absence of the testator, yet the credit due the witness should be left to the jury to determine, as in all other cases. Beadles v. Alexander, 68 Tenn. 604, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1877).

       The declarations of a deceased subscribing witness as to what took place at the making of the will and as to the instructions of the testator to the draftsman are not admissible for any purpose. Weatherhead v. Sewell, 28 Tenn. 272, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1848); Sellars v. Sellars, 49 Tenn. 430, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1871); Wheeler v. Parr, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 374 (1912).

       While the proponent of the will is not required to take the deposition of subscribing witnesses who reside in another state, because such nonresidence authorizes the admission of proof of their handwriting; yet if the deposition of such a witness has been taken, and is in court, it ought to be read, though the failure to read it will be cured by the defendant's reading it himself.

       It is not essential that the subscribing witnesses should be informed of the provisions of the will, but such information may serve as one means of future identification.

       Judgment founded on actual observation of the capacity, disposition, temper, character, peculiarities of habit, form, features, or handwriting of others, is more than mere opinion. Such judgment approaches to knowledge, and is knowledge, so far as the imperfection of human nature will permit knowledge of these things to be acquired, and the result thus acquired should be communicated to the jury, because they have not had the opportunities of personal observation, and because in no other way can they effectually have the benefit of the knowledge gained by the observations of others. Norton v. Moore, 40 Tenn. 480, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 136 (1859); Wisener & Brown v. Maupin, 61 Tenn. 342, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 383 (1872).

       The proof of witnesses other than the subscribing witnesses will not suffice, unless it, in truth, shows that all formalities requisite to a valid subscription were observed. Simmons v. Leonard, 91 Tenn. 183, 18 S.W. 280, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 92, 30 Am. St. Rep. 875 (1892).

       The declarations of the testator, whether made before or after the execution of the will, or as part of the res gestae at the time of its execution or publication, or in the presence of the party adversely affected thereby, are competent and admissible in evidence to show a valid execution of the will, the testator's mental capacity, his knowledge of the contents of the will, his comprehension and approval of it as written, and his incapacity and susceptibility to extraneous influences, but not to prove the fact of undue influence. Demonbreun v. Walker, 63 Tenn. 199, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 227 (1874); Beadles v. Alexander, 68 Tenn. 604, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1877); Linch v. Linch, 69 Tenn. 526, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 132 (1878); Maxwell v.

       The testator's declarations that he signed the will in the presence of the subscribing witnesses, or any of his statements going to the validity of the will, are admissible in evidence. Beadles v. Alexander, 68 Tenn. 604, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1877).

       Though the devisees and legatees under the will are incompetent as subscribing witnesses, they are competent witnesses to prove the testator's declarations and statements tending to establish the validity of the will.

       Where a will is sought to be impeached, or the probate thereof is resisted, upon the grounds of undue influence and testamentary incapacity, the declarations of the testator, made either before or after the execution of the will, are admissible to show his mental incapacity, but are inadmissible as substantive evidence to prove the fact of undue influence. Peery v. Peery, 94 Tenn. 328, 29 S.W. 1, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1895); Kirkpatrick v. Jenkins' Ex'rs, 96 Tenn. 85, 33 S.W. 819, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 13 (1896); Earp v.

      <p>
       The declarations of the testator, made either before or after the execution of the will, may be considered upon the issue of mental incapacity, but not upon the issue of undue influence, unless there is independent testimony indicating undue influence, and then only to show a condition of mind susceptible to such influence and the effect thereof upon the testamentary act. Kirkpatrick v. Jenkins' Ex'rs, 96 Tenn. 85, 33 S.W. 819, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 13 (1896); Hobson v. Moorman, 115 Tenn. 73, 90 S.W. 152, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 46, 3 L.R.A. (n.s.) 749 (1905).

       Declarations of testator subsequent to the execution of his will, as to whether a child born to his wife was his child, and as to the circumstance of her birth, are not admissible to rebut the contention, based on the failure to provide for such child, that the will was not the testator's voluntary act.

       In view of the opportunity and temptation for falsification, and as it would open the door to fraud, testimony of conversation with the testator, occurring either before or after the making of the will, as to his purpose or reasons for making a disposition or failing to make a disposition, is not admissible to attack the will.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory requirement that contested wills “shall be proved by all the living witnesses, if to be found” is not to be construed literally; and the subsequent incompetency of the attesting witness, or his absence from the state, so that his testimony or attendance cannot be compelled, will authorize the admission of proof of his handwriting. Jones v. Arterburn, 30 Tenn. 97, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the attesting witness denies his attestation, or will not swear that he saw the testator execute and publish his will, or alleges the incapacity of the testator, his handwriting may be proved and his testimony controverted. Even if the subscribing witnesses all swear that the will was not duly executed, the devisee may, notwithstanding, go into other evidence to prove its due execution. Rose v. Allen, 41 Tenn. 23, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1860).

       When the signatures of the subscribing witnesses are proved to be genuine, nothing else appearing, the presumption is conclusive that the attestation was made in the presence of the testator; but if there be positive testimony on the subject by the subscribing witnesses, or otherwise, it then becomes a question for the jury to settle upon the evidence.

       As a general rule, the proponent of a will need not prove that the testator had knowledge of the contents; but where the testator was blind, illiterate, or decrepit, or other suspicious circumstances surrounded the case, the proponent must, in addition, prove the testator's knowledge of and assent to the contents of the will. Patton v. Allison, 26 Tenn. 320, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 133 (1846); Rutland v. Gleaves & Thompson, 31 Tenn. 198, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1851); Cox v. Cox, 36 Tenn. 81, 1856 Tenn.

      <p>
       Where the draftsman of the will takes an interest under it, that circumstance should awaken the vigilance of the jury to see whether a knowledge of its contents was brought home to the testator, and, under such suspicious circumstances, the jury ought not to be satisfied with the mere proof of the execution of the will, and that the testator was of a testamentary capacity, but there ought to be affirmative and plenary evidence that he had knowledge of the contents and fully and freely sanctioned the same. The mere previous declarations of the testator, in conformity with the contents, may be sufficient evidence thereof, if satisfactory to the jury. Patton v. Allison, 26 Tenn. 320, 1846 Tenn.

       The testimony of one witness, of undoubted credit, to the fact of the testator's knowledge of the contents of the will, is sufficient to warrant the jury in finding in favor of the will. Cox v. Cox, 36 Tenn. 81, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1856).

       Testator's knowledge of and assent to provisions of will may be established by circumstances of a nature to convince the mind of its truth. Cox v. Cox, 36 Tenn. 81, 1856 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       In case the testator was blind, illiterate, or decrepit, or other suspicious circumstances surrounded the case, the best evidence of his knowledge and assent is proof that the will was correctly read to him, though the knowledge and assent may be otherwise proved. It is not essential that the reading of the will to the testator be done by a disinterested person. Watterson v. Watterson, 38 Tenn. 1, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (1858); Maxwell v. Hill, 89 Tenn. 584, 15 S.W. 253, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1891).

      <p>
       The fact that the testator signed the will by making his mark is prima facie evidence of his inability to write, or to read writing, and this manner of signing must be explained, or there ought to be proof of knowledge of the contents of the will, and assent thereto, to make the formal execution complete, and to entitle the plaintiffs to a verdict, if no counter proof is offered. Bartee v. Thompson, 67 Tenn. 508, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1875); Maxwell v. Hill, 89 Tenn. 584, 15 S.W. 253, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1891).

       The right of contestants to have the issue of the mental capacity of the testator submitted to the jury in will contest must rest upon substantial or material evidence at the time the will was made and not upon “scintilla” or “glimmer” of evidence. Jones v. Sands, 41 Tenn. App. 1, 292 S.W.2d 492, 1953 Tenn. App. LEXIS 130 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not necessary to have any direct testimony that at the moment the will was made the state of mind of the testator was such that he was incompetent if from the proven surrounding facts and circumstances the jury could have determined the state of the testator's mind at the moment he signed the will. Jones v. Sands, 41 Tenn. App. 1, 292 S.W.2d 492, 1953 Tenn. App. LEXIS 130 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest in which proponents of will made a motion for a directed verdict and in which there was conflicting medical evidence as to the sanity of the testator, only the medical testimony offered by the contestants could be considered in determining the motion. Jones v. Sands, 41 Tenn. App. 1, 292 S.W.2d 492, 1953 Tenn. App. LEXIS 130 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest where grounds of contest were weakness of mind and undue influence, contestants should have been permitted to take discovery deposition of executrix to enable them to see prior will of testatrix. Kelley v. Brading, 47 Tenn. App. 223, 337 S.W.2d 471, 1960 Tenn. App. LEXIS 78 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1960).

       Unless the deceased has already been adjudicated insane at the time of the execution of a will, the burden is always upon the one who alleges an unsound mind to prove it. Parham v. Walker, 568 S.W.2d 622, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).

       The existence of a guardianship or conservatorship is not per se an adjudication of an unsound mind, that is, an adjudication of mental incapacity to execute a will. Parham v. Walker, 568 S.W.2d 622, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).

       Once the existence of a confidential relationship is proven, undue influence is presumed and the recipient must prove an exception to the presumption by carrying the burden of showing the fairness of the transaction and the nonexistence of the presumed undue influence, and if the recipient fails in that burden, the transaction is presumed void. Parham v. Walker, 568 S.W.2d 622, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of a court-ordered relationship of conservator-ward is not proof of lack of testamentary capacity, but it is proof of a confidential relationship, and where testatrix left her entire estate to her conservator, the burden was upon the will beneficiary to show the fairness and honesty of the transaction and to negate the presumption of undue influence.

       Attesting and subscribing witnesses, and they only, are trusted to give their mere opinions as to the testator's sanity, without assigning cause or reason therefor. Physicians may state their opinions as to the soundness or unsoundness of the testator's mind, but they must state the circumstances or symptoms from which they draw their conclusions. As to all other witnesses, their opinion, considered merely as opinions, are not evidence. Such witnesses, testifying as to their means of observing the testator, must state his appearance, conduct, conversation, manner, peculiarities, or deportment, or other particular fact from which his state of mind may be inferred, whereupon they may state their inferences, conclusions, or opinions as to the soundness or unsoundness of the testator's mind, as the result of those facts. Gibson v. Gibson, 17 Tenn. 329, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1836); Van Huss v. Rainbolt, 42 Tenn. 139, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1865); Wisener & Brown v. Maupin, 61 Tenn. 342, 1872 Tenn.

      <p>
       While witnesses, other than attesting witnesses or physicians, may testify whether the testator was “in his senses,” or of sound mind, yet they cannot testify whether he was capable of making a will, for the latter proposition involves a question of law and fact, and is the very question to be determined by the jury, and it would be entirely illegal to permit witnesses to give to the jury their opinions as to the testator's testamentary capacity. Whether the particular phase of mental unsoundness deprives a person of testamentary capacity is a matter for the exclusive determination of the court and jury. The witness may testify that the testator was not of “sound mind,” but he will not be permitted to testify that the testator was not of a “disposing memory.” Gibson v. Gibson, 17 Tenn. 329, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1836); Wisener & Brown v. Maupin, 61 Tenn. 342, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 383 (1872); Kirkpatrick v. Kirkpatrick, 1 Shan. 258 (1872).

       On an issue of mental incapacity, the opinion of each witness must stand upon the facts detailed by that witness, and where several witnesses are used to detail different actions of a testator as a basis for expressing an opinion of the incapacity of such testator, such circumstances cannot be lumped together in order to test the validity of separate opinions so expressed.

      <p>
       The question of sanity is peculiarly a question of fact for the jury, and a party seeking to impeach the validity of a will for a supposed want of sanity on the part of the testator must establish the fact of insanity by the clearest and most satisfactory proof. Gass' Heirs v. Gass' Ex'rs, 22 Tenn. 278, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1842); Porter v. Campbell, 61 Tenn. 81, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof rests upon the proponents of the will to establish its due and formal execution; but, in the absence of suspicious circumstances, the proponents need not prove testamentary capacity, because the law prima facie presumes the testator's sanity; and where the will is contested upon the ground of fraud, undue influence, unsoundness of mind, or want of testamentary capacity, the burden of proof rests upon the contestants to establish the same. Ford v. Ford, 26 Tenn. 92, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1846); Cox v. Cox, 36 Tenn. 81, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1856); Porter v. Campbell, 61 Tenn. 81, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1872); Smith v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the proponent of the contested will alleges that forgery of a revoking will, the fact of forgery need not be proved by any greater preponderance of evidence than ordinarily obtains in civil cases; a slight preponderance is sufficient in such case. McBee v. Bowman, 89 Tenn. 132, 14 S.W. 481, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 31 (1890).

      </p>
      <p>
       If proponent of will was in a confidential relationship with deceased and is a beneficiary under the purported will, and caused the will to be drafted and executed, the law presumes proponent exercised undue influence on deceased and casts the burden upon proponent to show by the greater weight and preponderance of evidence that he did not exercise undue influence upon deceased.

Porter v. Campbell, 61 Tenn. 81, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1872); McBee v. Bowman, 89 Tenn. 132, 14 S.W. 481, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 31 (1890).

       The circuit court acts correctly, in refusing to reopen a will contest case for the further examination of an adverse witness, with the view of proving that in conversation with a certain party he made a statement of his mere opinion, though in the form stated as a fact, and to contradict him, if he denied making such statement, when no sufficient legal excuse was shown for not having offered such testimony at the proper time.

       The order of introducing the testimony is for the proponents of the will first to introduce the subscribing witnesses and prove its due execution. Frear v. Williams, 66 Tenn. 550, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 181 (1874); Key v. Holloway, 66 Tenn. 575, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (1874); Bartee v. Thompson, 67 Tenn. 508, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1875).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is only necessary for the executor to prove the formal execution of the will in the first place, still, if he examines the subscribing witnesses as to the testamentary capacity of the testator, he is not thereby precluded from adducing other evidence on that question by way of rebutting the testimony of the contestants. Key v. Holloway, 66 Tenn. 575, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (1874).

       Although the evidence of the mental incapacity of the testatrix was immaterial, the complainants who had introduced evidence of such incapacity could not deprive defendants of the right to introduce counter evidence.

       Where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, summary judgment is appropriate in a will contest proceeding and does not amount to an improper denial of a right to jury trial. Union Planters Nat'l Bank v. Inman, 588 S.W.2d 757, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 351 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

       It was error for a judge to require a jury on the demand of a party made several days before the first day of the term, however, since it was not shown that this error affected the result of the trial, the judgment was affirmed.

       A general verdict and judgment in favor of the will establishes it for all purposes, namely, as to the disposition of the realty as well as that of the personalty. Wright v. Smithson, 75 Tenn. 12, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       A general verdict and judgment in favor of the will will not be disturbed because the paper as set out in the declaration is without attesting witnesses, where it might well be set up as a holographic will, according to the plaintiff's declaration. Wright v. Smithson, 75 Tenn. 12, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest, as in other cases tried to a jury, if there is any competent, material and substantial evidence to support the verdict of the jury, the appellate courts will not interfere with that verdict and judgment thereon, in the absence of any error on the part of the trial court, which the appellate court, from the record, cannot determine affirmatively affected the results reached by the jury. Scott v. Atkins, 44 Tenn. App. 353, 314 S.W.2d 52, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 161 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

      <p>
       The rule that in passing upon a motion for a directed verdict, a trial court must look to all the evidence, construe it most favorably on behalf of the party against whom the motion is made, taking as true that which supports his rights, and allow all reasonable inferences from the evidence in his favor, discarding all countervailing evidence applies in will contests the same as in other cases where facts are triable by a jury.

       Authority to direct a verdict in a will contest is the same as in other cases within the purview of constitutional guaranty of trial by jury. Curry v. Bridges, 45 Tenn. App. 395, 325 S.W.2d 87, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).

       Where testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses was positive as to the execution of the will the fact that the other subscribing witness testified that she did not remember witnessing the will, although she identified her signature and that of the other witness as being genuine was not sufficient to require the submission of the validity of the execution of the will to the jury.

       The proceedings contemplated by this statute are proceedings that take place in the probate court, and a proceeding in the circuit court on the issue of devisavit vel non after the case is certified from the probate court to the circuit court is in substance an original proceeding to probate the will, separate and distinct from any proceedings held in probate court.

       The Tennessee ancillary probate of foreign wills statute does not apply where the testator was domiciled in Tennessee at the time of his death even though the will was executed outside the state. Bearman v. Camatsos, 215 Tenn. 231, 385 S.W.2d 91, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 557 (1964).

      <p>
       The object of the statutes regulating the admission of records of probate from the courts of another state was to avoid the difficulty that often occurred by reason of the original will being lodged as a permanent record in the court at testator's domicile and preventing its removal to other states for probate where the testator left property that passed under the will. The existence of such statutes however and their application for the purposes designed would not in any degree impair the jurisdiction of the county court over the probate of an original bill. Woodfin v. Union Planters Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 174 Tenn. 367, 125 S.W.2d 487, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 100 (1939); Bearman v. Camatsos, 215 Tenn. 231, 385 S.W.2d 91, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 557 (1964).

       Where a will executed in Louisiana was admitted to probate in that state as a holographic will and was sufficient under the laws of that state to pass title to land, such will was entitled to be admitted to probate in Tennessee and would pass title to land here even though it did not appear that the will met the requirements of a holographic will under the Tennessee statutes.

       Where a will was duly admitted to probate in Louisiana, and was executed according to the law of Louisiana, where the testatrix was at the time domiciled, and having been executed according to the law of the place where it was made, the will was accordingly entitled to probate in this state. Under the laws of Louisiana, a holographic will, executed and proven as this was, is sufficient to pass title to realty in Louisiana, and, under this section, being entitled to reprobate here, is likewise sufficient to pass title to real property in this state.

       Where a foreign will has not been probated in another jurisdiction, any person interested may apply for its probate before the probate court of the county in this state in which the real estate or any part of the real estate is located.

      <li id="t32c05s32-5-110ol1b">
       To that end the interested person shall present a petition to the probate court, setting forth the death of the foreign testator, the decedent's ownership of lands in the county, and the fact of the decedent's testacy, whereupon the court shall authorize the taking of such proof as may be necessary to prove the will in accordance with the laws of this state.

         When the depositions are taken by oral examination, the time that elapses between the making of the order for the depositions and the taking of the depositions shall not be less than the time prescribed for notice for taking depositions under the general laws.

       On being admitted to probate, the probate shall have the same force and effect as to real estate as the probate in this state of wills of residents of this state have as to lands devised by them, but nothing in this section is to prevent the proving of foreign wills as at common law and without probate.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c05s32-5-110ol1f">
       The will shall, as to real estate, be to the same extent and in the same manner as domestic wills subject to contest in the state, and certified copies of the record in the probate court shall be available as evidence as are copies of domestic wills and probate of domestic wills; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall apply to wills dated more than fifty-five (55) years prior to the enactment of this Code.
