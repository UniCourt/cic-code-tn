   Dismissal of a claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), <cite class="us_code">38 U.S.C. § 4301</cite> et seq., was proper because, for an individual to sustain an action against a state pursuant to USERRA, the action must have been permitted by state law, and the Tennessee general assembly had not passed legislation to expressly waive its sovereign immunity from claims based on USERRA; appellant's claim that the state of Tennessee had impliedly waived its immunity from USERRA claims by expressly waiving its immunity from claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.04.html#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_blank">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., and the Tennessee Disability Act, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c50s8-50-103ol1a" target="_blank">8-50-103(a)</a></cite>, was misplaced because any such waiver had to be made in plain, clear, and unmistakable terms. The Tennessee National Guard was a division of the Tennessee Military Department, and thus was an entity of the state of Tennessee, and accordingly, the Tennessee National Guard had immunity from claims arising under the USERRA.

        The general assembly finds and declares that the state is vulnerable to a wide range of emergencies, including natural, technological, terrorist acts, and manmade disasters, all of which threaten the life, health, and safety of its people; damage and destroy property; disrupt services and everyday business and recreational activities; and impede economic growth and development. The general assembly further finds that this vulnerability is exacerbated by the growth in the state's population, in the elderly population, in the number of seasonal vacationers, and in the number of persons with special needs. This growth has greatly complicated the state's ability to coordinate its emergency management resources and activities.
       </li>
       <li id="t58c02s58-2-102ol1b">
        It is the intent of the general assembly to reduce the vulnerability of the people and property of this state; to prepare for efficient evacuation or shelter-in-place of threatened or affected persons; to provide for the rapid and orderly provision of relief to persons and for the restoration of services and property; and to provide for the coordination of activities relating to emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation among and between agencies and officials of this state, with similar agencies and officials of other states, with local and federal governments, with interstate organizations, and with the private sector.
       </li>
       <li id="t58c02s58-2-102ol1c">
        It is further the intent of the general assembly to promote the state's emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation capabilities through enhanced coordination, long-term planning, and adequate funding. State policy for responding to disasters is to support local emergency response efforts. In the case of a major or catastrophic disaster, however, the needs of residents and communities will likely be greater than local resources. In these situations, the state must be capable of providing effective, coordinated, and timely support to communities and the public. Therefore, the general assembly hereby determines and declares that this chapter fulfills a compelling state interest.

In the event of an emergency beyond local control, the governor, or, in the governor's absence, the governor's successor as provided by law, may assume direct operational control over all or any part of the emergency management functions within this state, and such person has the power through proper process of law to carry out this chapter.

       The General Assembly has vested the Governor with exclusive responsibility and authority to assume control over all aspects of the State's response to an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the executive orders that the Governor issues pursuant to that authority have the force and effect of law, the Governor's directives in response to an emergency supersede and preempt any action taken by political subdivisions of the State. Absent an express delegation of power by the Governor, local governmental entities may not take actions that are either more restrictive or less restrictive with respect to the subjects addressed in the Governor's executive orders governing the State's emergency response to COVID-19. Such action would be at cross purposes with the Governor's orders, which are the law of the State, and would constitute an impermissible legal conflict. Just as the Governor may exercise his authority to delegate to a local governmental entity or to the local health department “such powers as the governor may deem prudent,” the Governor may exercise his emergency powers to expressly authorize, or recognize the authority of, county health departments to take action that may otherwise be inconsistent with his executive orders. Such a delegation of authority may be revoked or modified at any time and, absent an express delegation or authorization by the Governor, the local health department or other local governmental entity may not take any action inconsistent with the Governor's executive orders.

      <p>
       Upon the request of two (2) or more adjoining counties, or if the governor finds that two (2) or more adjoining counties would be better served by an interjurisdictional arrangement than by maintaining separate emergency management agencies and service, the governor may delineate by executive order or rule an interjurisdictional area adequate to plan for, prevent, mitigate, or respond to emergencies in such area and may direct steps to be taken as necessary, including the creation of an interjurisdictional relationship, a joint emergency plan, a provision for mutual aid, or an area organization for emergency planning and services. A finding of the governor pursuant to this subdivision (3)(B) shall be based on one (1) or more factors related to the difficulty of maintaining an efficient and effective emergency prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery system on a nonjurisdictional basis, such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitations on public financial resources severe enough to make maintenance of a separate emergency management agency and services unreasonably burdensome;
      </p>
      <p>
       Unusual vulnerability to emergencies as evidenced by a past history of emergencies, topographical features, drainage characteristics, emergency potential, and presence of emergency-prone facilities or operations;
      </p>
      <p>
       The interrelated character of the counties in a multicounty area; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Other relevant conditions or circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local emergency planning committees.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Each local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is authorized to assess and collect an annual fee of one hundred dollars ($100) from member facilities and industries within its emergency planning district required to submit tier II reports in accordance with federal law, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 11001</cite> et seq. Such fee shall be assessed and collected in the manner authorized by each such LEPC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revenue derived from such fee shall be used solely by the LEPC for conducting annual event exercises, educating the public, and printing the Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subdivision (4) applies to LEPCs in any county having a population of not less than seventy-one thousand, three hundred (71,300) nor more than seventy-one thousand, four hundred (71,400), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, upon the adoption of a resolution by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the county legislative body of such county.

          The purpose of this compact is to provide mutual aid among the states in meeting any emergency or disaster from enemy attack, including sabotage and subversive acts and direct attacks by bombs, shellfire, and atomic, radiological, chemical, bacteriological means, and other weapons. The prompt, full and effective utilization of the resources of the respective states, including such resources as may be available from the United States government or any other source are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people thereof in the event of enemy attack or other emergency, and any other resources, including personnel, equipment or supplies, shall be incorporated into a plan or plans of mutual aid to be developed among the civil defense agencies or similar bodies of the states that are parties hereto. The directors of civil defense of all party states shall constitute a committee to formulate plans and take all necessary steps for the implementation of this compact.

There shall be frequent consultation between the representatives of the states and with the United States government and the free exchange of information and plans, including inventories of any materials and equipment available for civil defense. In carrying out such civil defense plans and programs, the party states shall so far as possible provide and follow uniform standards, practices and rules and regulations, including:

          Article 9.
         </p>

          Plans for the orderly evacuation and reception of the civilian population as the result of an emergency or disaster shall be worked out from time to time between representatives of the party states and the various local civil defense areas thereof. Such plans shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees shall be reimbursed generally for the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed by the party state of which the evacuees are residents, or by the United States government under plans approved by it. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state of which the evacuees are resident shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support or repatriation of such evacuees.

         </h3>
         <p>
          <p>
   The emergency management assistance compact referred to in §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t58c02s58-2-401" target="_self">58-2-401</a></cite> which the governor is authorized to execute on behalf of the state is as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE I —  PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES
         </p>
         <p>
          This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.
         </p>
         <p>
          The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
         </p>
         <p>
          This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE II —  GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
         </p>
         <p>
          Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and the intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
         </p>
         <p>
          The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
         </p>
         <p>
          On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE III —  PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES
         </p>
         <p>
          A.  It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:
         </p>
         <p>
          i.  Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
         </p>
         <p>
          ii.  Review party state's individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.
         </p>
         <p>
          iii.  Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.
         </p>
         <p>
          iv.  Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.
         </p>
         <p>
          v.  Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material.
         </p>
         <p>
          vi.  Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.
         </p>
         <p>
          vii.  Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.
         </p>
         <p>
          B.  The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to the authorized representative. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:
         </p>
         <p>
          i.  A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.
         </p>
         <p>
          ii.  The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.
         </p>
         <p>
          iii.  The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.
         </p>
         <p>
          C.  There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE IV —  LIMITATIONS
         </p>
         <p>
          Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s), whichever is longer.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE V —  LICENSES AND PERMITS
         </p>
         <p>
          Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE VI —  LIABILITY
         </p>
         <p>
          Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE VII —  SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS
         </p>
         <p>
          Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE VIII —  COMPENSATION
         </p>
         <p>
          Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE IX —  REIMBURSEMENT
         </p>
         <p>
          Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII shall not be reimbursable under this provision.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE X —  EVACUATION
         </p>
         <p>
          Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation or such evacuees.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE XI —  IMPLEMENTATION
         </p>
         <p>
          A.  This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two (2) states; thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.
         </p>
         <p>
          B.  Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty (30) days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
         </p>
         <p>
          C.  Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE XII —  VALIDITY
         </p>
         <p>
          Chapter 247 of the Public Acts of 1995 shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I hereof. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of Chapter 247 of the Public Acts of 1995 and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
         </p>
         <p>
          ARTICLE XIII —  ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
         </p>
         <p>
          Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under Section 1385 of title 18, United States Code.
         </p>
         <p>
          Acts 1995, ch. 247, § 2; 2010, ch. 745, § 2.

            <p>
             The general assembly of the state of Tennessee hereby ratifies a compact on behalf of the state of Tennessee with any other state legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE I. PURPOSE
            </p>
            <p>
             The purpose of this compact is to provide mutual aid among the states in meeting any emergency or disaster caused by earthquakes or other seismic disturbances. The full, immediate, and effective utilization of the resources of the respective states, including such resources as may be available from the United States government or any other source, is necessary to provide needed short-term earthquake disaster assistance to states requesting aid. These resources shall be incorporated into a plan or plans of mutual aid to be developed among the appropriate agencies of states that are parties to this compact. These agencies shall develop and follow procedures designed to assure the maintenance of resource inventories and the exchange of information about earthquakes and disaster response. It is the policy of the party states to carry out this compact in a spirit of cooperation to provide the most effective earthquake disaster assistance to the residents of the states and to provide an equitable division of any necessary earthquake relief efforts in order to avoid a disproportionate allocation of contributed resources.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE II. INTRASTATE PLANNING
            </p>
            <p>
             Each party state shall have the duty to formulate earthquake relief plans and programs within such state. There shall be frequent consultation between the representatives of such states and with the United States government and the free exchange of relief plans and information, including inventories of any materials and equipment available for response to earthquake emergencies. To this end, each state will maintain a bank of standardized data which will establish a comprehensive listing of all resources within the seven-state region that might be needed during an earthquake disaster. The inventory will be shared equitably among the party states in the event of an earthquake or other emergency, recognizing each state's primary responsibility to assist and protect its residents. Each party state shall also share any available information on earthquake forecasts and reports of seismic activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE III. RESPONSIBILITIES OF STATES
            </p>
            <p>
             Whenever the governor of a party state requests aid from the governor of another party state pursuant to this compact in coping with an earthquake emergency, the requested state shall make available all possible aid to the requesting state consonant with the maintenance of protection for its residents and the policies stated in Article I.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE IV. RECIPROCITY
            </p>
            <p>
             Whenever the officers or employees of any party state are rendering aid in another state pursuant to the request of another party state under this compact, those officers or employees shall, while under the direction of the authorities of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges, and immunities as comparable officers and employees of the state to which they are rendering aid. Any person holding a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state, demonstrating the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills may render aid involving such skill in any party state to meet an earthquake emergency, and the state in which aid is rendered shall give due recognition to such license, certificate, or other permit as if issued in the state in which aid is rendered.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE V. IMMUNITY
            </p>
            <p>
             No party state or its officers, employees or other persons, certified by party states pursuant to agreed upon criteria and procedures for certification, rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on their part while so engaged, or on account of maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE VI. SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing in this agreement precludes any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or states for the undertaking of mutual aid and exchange of information in the event of an earthquake emergency. These supplementary agreements may comprehend, but are not limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, equipment and supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE VII. COMPENSATION
            </p>
            <p>
             Each party state shall provide compensation and death benefits to its injured officers, employees or other persons certified by party states, pursuant to agreed upon criteria and procedures for certification, and the representatives of deceased officers, employees and other certified persons in case officers, employees or certified persons sustain injuries or death while rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within the state by or in which the officer, employee or certified person was regularly employed.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE VIII. REIMBURSEMENT
            </p>
            <p>
             Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in, the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries and maintenance of officers, employees and equipment incurred in connection with such request, including amounts paid under Article VII; provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting party state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost. Any two (2) or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs as among those states. The United States government may relieve the party state receiving aid from any liability and reimburse the party state rendering aid for loss, damage or expense incurred within the terms of this article.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE IX. EVACUATION PLANS
            </p>
            <p>
             Plans for the orderly evacuation and reception of the civilian population as the result of an earthquake emergency shall be worked out from time to time between representatives of the party states. Such plans shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. The plans must provide that the party state receiving evacuees shall be reimbursed generally for the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for the evacuees, for the expenditures and transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care and like items. These expenditures shall be reimbursed by the party state of which the evacuees are residents or by the United States government under plans approved by it. The party state of which the evacuees are residents shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support or repatriation of such evacuees.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE X. AVAILABILITY
            </p>
            <p>
             Any state of the United States shall be eligible to become party to this compact. As to any eligible party state, this compact shall become effective when its legislature shall have enacted it into law; provided, that it shall not become initially effective until enacted into law by two (2) party states.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE XI. WITHDRAWAL
            </p>
            <p>
             Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall become effective until ninety (90) days after the governor of the withdrawing state shall have sent formal notice in writing to the governor of each other party state informing the governors of the action of the legislature in repealing the compact and declaring an intention to withdraw. A withdrawing state shall be liable for any obligations which it may have incurred on account of its party status up to the effective date of withdrawal, except that if the withdrawing state has specifically undertaken or committed itself to any performance of an obligation extending beyond the effective date of withdrawal it shall remain liable to the extent of such obligation.
            </p>
            <p>
             ARTICLE XII. SEVERABILITY
            </p>
            <p>
             This compact is to be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances is not to be affected by it.

         Attorney General Opinions. Under Tennessee state law, the Tennessee State Veterans' Homes (TSVH) may not admit veterans who received a general discharge under honorable conditions. TSVH is required to provide support and care for honorably discharged veterans who served in the United States armed forces. An “honorable discharge” from the United States armed forces is separate and distinct from “a general discharge under honorable conditions.”  Furthermore, federal law does not preempt the eligibility requirements imposed by the state. To the contrary, federal law contemplates that each State will establish eligibility and admission criteria for its state veterans' homes. OAG 20-13, 2020 Tenn. AG LEXIS 17 (6/12/2020).
