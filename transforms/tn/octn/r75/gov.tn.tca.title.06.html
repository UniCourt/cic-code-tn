        Roll-off dumpster services are “public services” because the proper collection and removal of waste promotes the public health and general welfare of a municipality’s residents. However, not all municipal residents have to use roll-off dumpster services for these services to be “public” ones. Further, a Tennessee municipality does not violate federal antitrust law when it awards an exclusive contract or franchise for roll-off dumpster services; the state-action doctrine shields the municipality from liability. Whether a municipality’s award of an exclusive contract or franchise for roll-off dumpster services passes muster under the Tennessee Constitution would necessarily be measured by the exigencies of the particular situation.  Whether a municipality may execute an exclusive contract or franchise agreement that requires its residents to pay a fee directly to the contractor or franchisee for roll-off dumpster services and that, at the same time, provides the municipality with a sum certain from the contractor or franchisee for each roll-off dumpster rental will depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding the execution of the particular agreement, as well as the particular terms and conditions of the agreement. House Bill 1293 of the 110th General Assembly, which would allow an individual to procure a roll-off dumpster from any business providing these services even if that person lives in a municipality that has awarded an exclusive contract or franchise to a particular waste management company to provide roll-off dumpster services, could be vulnerable to a challenge that it violates Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution and article I, section 20 of the Tennessee Constitution.

         Because, by its own terms, Jefferson City, Tenn., Mun. Code § 7-402 could not be characterized as being tantamount to a zoning ordinance, it was not a zoning restriction under the substantial effect test since the ordinance did not refer to nor did its operation depend upon the city's zoning plan, and it did not refer to land, zones, buildings, lot lines, or any other terms and concepts customarily associated with comprehensive zoning plans; the ordinance reflected the exercise of the city's traditional, general police power granted in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02s6-2-201ol122" target="_self">6-2-201(22)</a></cite>SNPCO, Inc. v.

However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation to my constituents and the citizens this body represents.’“(2) In the event a member of a local governing body of a county or a municipality has a conflict of interest in a matter to be voted upon by the body, the member may abstain for cause by announcing such to the presiding officer. Any member of a local governing body of a county or municipality, who abstains from voting for cause on any issue coming to a vote before the body shall not be counted for the purpose of determining a majority vote.“(3) The vote of any person having a conflict of interest who does not inform the governing body of such conflict as provided in subdivision (b)(1) shall be void if challenged in a timely manner. As used in this subdivision (b)(3), ‘timely manner’ means during the same meeting at which the vote was cast and prior to the transaction of any further business by the body.“(4) Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed as altering, amending or otherwise affecting § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.12.html#t12c04s12-4-101ol1a" target="_blank">12-4-101(a)</a></cite>.

On the failure of such person to appear at the time specified, the amount so deposited shall be forfeited to the municipality and such person shall not be entitled to the return of any part thereof and it shall not be necessary to issue a scire facias; provided, that within two (2) days of the imposition of the forfeiture, the city judge shall have the power to set aside the conditional judgment imposing such forfeiture when it shall be made to appear that the failure of the accused to appear and defend such accused's suit was due to no fault or negligence of the accused. After the expiration of the two (2) days, there may be a final judgment imposing a forfeiture.

       Code Commission Notes.

      <p>
       The provisions of former subdivisions (a)(2)(A)-(J)(i)-(iv) and (K) have been held unconstitutional, and have been deleted by authority of the code commission. Former subdivision (a)(2)(J)(v) was redesignated (a)(2)(E) in 1998.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compiler's Notes. Acts 1981, ch. 522 deleted “provided the ordinance shall not become operative until thirty (30) days after final passage” from the end of former subsection (a). However, because of qualifications on the applicability on the act deleting that material, and thus the continued applicability of the deleted language to certain counties, two versions of former subsection (a) have been set up: subdivision (a)(1), containing the language, and subdivision (a)(2)(A), reflecting the deletion of the language by Acts 1981, ch. 522. See Vollmer v. City of Memphis, 730 S.W.2d 619 (Tenn. 1987), and opinions of the attorney general, OAG 88-84 (4/15/88), including April 20, 1988 supplement to that opinion, as well as OAG U86-67 (4/7/86), regarding the constitutionality of various provisions in this section.

      <p>
       Acts 2003, ch. 90, § 2, directed the code commission to change all references from “county executive” to “county mayor” and to include all such changes in supplements and replacement volumes for the Tennessee Code Annotated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2008, ch. 818, § 3 amended this section by deleting former subdivisions (a)(2)(A)-(D). Former subdivision (a)(2) provided applicability provisions for former subdivisions (a)(2)(A)-(D) that were deleted by the act.

       Acts 2014 ch. 707, § 2(b) provides that § 2(a), which deletes subsections (a), (c), and (d) of this section, prohibits any annexation by ordinance that is not both operative and effective prior to May 16, 2015.

      <p>
       Acts 2015, ch. 512, § 18 provided that the act take effect at 12:01 a.m. on May 16, 2015.  However, the governor signed the act and it became law on May 20, 2015.  Pursuant to Article II, § 20, of the Constitution of Tennessee, the act takes effect 40 days after the bill became law.  Thus, the effective date of the act is June 29, 2015.

       Amendments. The 2014 amendment, effective May 16, 2015,  deleted former (a) which read: “(1) A municipality, when petitioned by a majority of the residents and property owners of the affected territory, or upon its own initiative when it appears that the prosperity of such municipality and territory will be materially retarded and the safety and welfare of the inhabitants and property endangered, after notice and public hearing, by ordinance, may extend its corporate limits by annexation of such territory adjoining its existing boundaries as may be deemed necessary for the welfare of the residents and property owners of the affected territory as well as the municipality as a whole; provided, that the ordinance shall not become operative until thirty (30) days after final passage thereof. During this thirty-day period, the municipality shall notify the county mayor in whose county the territory being annexed is located that territory located in the unincorporated part of the county is being annexed by the municipality. The notification shall include a copy of the annexation ordinance and a map of the area being annexed.“(2) The provisions of subdivision (a)(1) that are in conflict with this subdivision (a)(2) do not apply to any county having a population of not less than three hundred nineteen thousand six hundred twenty-five (319,625) nor more than three hundred nineteen thousand seven hundred twenty-five (319,725), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census. In such county, if the proposal to extend the corporate limits by the annexation of territory adjoining the existing boundaries of a municipality is proposed by the municipality upon its own initiative by ordinance, the ordinance shall not become operative until an election is held at the expense of the proposing municipality for approval or disapproval of such annexation by the qualified voters who reside in the territory proposed for annexation. The operation of the ordinance shall be subject to approval of the voters who reside in such territory. The county election commission shall hold an election thereon, providing options to vote ‘For’ or ‘Against’ the ordinance, not less than forty-five (45) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the receipt of a certified copy of such ordinance, and a majority vote of those voting in the election shall determine whether the ordinance is to be operative. A vote ‘For’ the ordinance shall be a vote ‘For Annexation’ and a vote ‘Against’ the ordinance shall be a vote ‘Against Annexation.’ If the vote is for the ordinance, the ordinance shall become operative thirty (30) days after the date that the county election commission makes its official canvass of the election returns; such ordinance shall not become operative before the expiration of one hundred twenty (120) days following the final passage of the annexation ordinance. If the ordinance is rejected, all relevant provisions in this chapter shall apply to the question of annexation in such county.“(3)(A) No municipality having a population greater than ten thousand (10,000), according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent federal census shall, by means of annexation by ordinance upon its own initiative, increase the land area contained within its boundaries by more than twenty-five percent (25%) during any twenty-four-month period.“(B)(i) Subdivision (a)(3)(A) shall not apply to any municipality having a population of less than twelve thousand (12,000), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, and the charter of which is provided for by a private act of the general assembly, and not under the general law of this title.“(ii) Subdivision (a)(3)(B)(i) shall not apply to any municipality located in any county having a population of not less than thirty-four thousand one hundred (34,100) nor greater than thirty-four thousand two hundred (34,200), or located in any county having a population of not less than thirty-seven thousand (37,000) nor greater than thirty-seven thousand one hundred (37,100), or located in any county having a population of not less than forty-nine thousand four hundred (49,400) nor greater than forty-nine thousand five hundred (49,500), each according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census.”; deleted former (c) which read: “Anything contained in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, a municipality in any county having a population of over sixty-six thousand (66,000), except in those counties having a population of more than seven hundred thousand (700,000), according to the federal census of 1970 or any subsequent federal census; or in those counties that have the metropolitan form of government, shall have the supplemental right and authority to annex upon its own initiative by ordinance any territory without levying any municipal ad valorem taxes, except for actual municipal services rendered, and that the residents of, and persons owning property in, annexed territory shall be entitled to rights and privileges of citizenship, in accordance with the provisions of the annexing municipality's charter, immediately upon annexation as though such annexed territory had always been a part of the annexing municipality; and it shall be the duty of the governing body to put into effect with respect to an annexed area any charter provisions relating to representation on the governing body. Any municipality that exercises such right to annex is hereby authorized, required and shall levy separate ad valorem taxes for each municipal purpose or service, or both, within the existing limits of the city and shall levy only such taxes, if any, in any territory annexed hereunder when and if the municipal service or purpose for which such taxes have been imposed is actually being rendered; provided, that in the case of sanitary sewers, such sewers shall be furnished within thirty-six (36) months after ad valorem taxes become due.”; deleted former (d) which read: “In counties having a population of more than seven hundred thousand (700,000), or having a population of not less than two hundred sixty thousand (260,000) nor more than two hundred eighty thousand (280,000), according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent federal census, or in those counties that have the metropolitan form of government, a smaller municipality may, by ordinance, extend its corporate limits by annexation of any contiguous territory, when such territory within the corporate limits of a larger municipality is less than seventy-five (75) acres in area, is not populated, is separated from the larger municipality by a limited access express highway, its access ramps or service roads, and is not the site of industrial plant development. The provisions of this chapter relative to the adoption of a plan of service and the submission of same to a local planning commission, if there is such, shall not be required of the smaller municipality for such annexation.”; and deleted “(a)(1) or” prior to “(b)(1)” in (e).

        The constitutionality of this law having been established, an ordinance enacted under its provisions is valid and constitutional if it meets the requirements of the statute. State ex rel.

        Action of a city in annexing territory under this section is not subject to constitutional challenge under U.S. Const., amend. 14 on the basis of the procedure employed or authorized hereunder or because of the pecuniary repercussions in the form of ordinary incidence of city taxation. Deane Hill Country Club, Inc. v. Knoxville, 379 F.2d 321, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5986 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1967), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">389 U.S. 975</cite>, <cite class="s_court">88 S.

        Annexation of territory in accordance with the provisions of this section did not deprive realtor of due process and equal privileges and immunities of law, did not amount to taking of property without just compensation or deprive realtor of jury trial in violation of United States Constitution or constitution of Tennessee. State ex rel. Balsinger v. Madisonville, 222 Tenn. 272, 435 S.W.2d 803, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 431 (1968)

       <p>
        Placing property within the corporate limits of a given town or city where it will be subjected to the additional burdens of municipal taxation and supervision is not an unconstitutional taking of property since it is not a taking at all as the ownership is in no degree changed and the increased burden is presumed equaled by the increased advantages.

        The whole theory of annexation is that it is a device by which a municipal corporation may plan for its orderly growth and development. The failure of a city to extend its corporate boundaries to embrace contiguous areas of growth and development is an abdication of responsibility. The time to annex is in the incipient stage of growth, lest the basic purpose of annexation be frustrated and the public interest suffer by the annexation of substandard areas. State ex rel.

        A hearing in the rooms of the city commission although there was room for only forty people and although 200 to 300 people gathered, was a sufficient public hearing where the room was open to the public and it was stated that everyone who had anything to say would be heard by the commission if it took all night to do it and everyone who wished was permitted to speak.

        Hearing of annexation ordinance that lasted one and one-half hours and at which the approximately 125 persons present were afforded an opportunity to express their opinions and have their questions answered was sufficient to meet the requirements for public hearing.

Knoxville v. State, 207 Tenn. 558, 341 S.W.2d 718, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 492 (1960); State ex rel. Campbell v. Morristown, 207 Tenn. 593, 341 S.W.2d 733, 1960 Tenn.

        In suit contesting annexation by ordinance, residents of the area proposed to be annexed were entitled to opportunity to show that annexation ordinance was unreasonable and not necessary for health, welfare and safety of persons living in such area. State ex rel. Campbell v. Morristown, 207 Tenn. 593, 341 S.W.2d 733, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 498 (1960), superseded by statute as stated in, Highwoods Props., Inc. v. City of Memphis, 297 S.W.3d 695, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 487 (Tenn. July 27, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the only ground on which an ordinance can be attacked is because it is unreasonable in consideration of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens, it was not improper for a court to strike from the bill provisions regarding other annexed areas, the activities of councilmen prior to passage, failure to consult the legal department, the county court (now county legislative body) or county commissioners, lack of funds to secure engineering service, opinions of the chamber of commerce or other associations and other similar provisions. State ex rel. Cathey v. Knoxville, 211 Tenn. 304, 364 S.W.2d 912, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 359 (1962), superseded by statute as stated in, Highwoods Props., Inc. v. City of Memphis, 297 S.W.3d 695, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 487 (Tenn. July 27, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was evidence both for and against annexation from which the trial judge could determine that the reasonableness of the ordinance was fairly debatable, trial judge was not in error in withdrawing the issue from the jury and finding the ordinance reasonable. State ex rel. Balsinger v. Madisonville, 222 Tenn. 272, 435 S.W.2d 803, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 431 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The factors to be taken into consideration in testing the reasonableness of any annexation ordinance include: the necessity for or use of municipal services, the ability and intent of the municipality to render municipal services and whether the annexation is for the sole purpose of increasing municipal revenues without an intent to benefit the area by rendering municipal services. Kingsport v. State, 562 S.W.2d 808, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 592 (Tenn. 1978); Saylors v. Jackson, 575 S.W.2d 264, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 689 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where most of the testimony was directed to showing a need for services in the annexed area and ability of the city to furnish those services, this evidence clearly demonstrated that the annexation was logical and reasonable and to the best interest of both the citizens and property owners of the city and of those in the annexed area. State ex rel. Wilson v. Lafayette, 572 S.W.2d 922, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 665 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Annexation was reasonable where the ordinance did not have as its sole purpose the collection of additional revenues, but improved municipal services would accrue to the citizens of the annexed area and there was a need for the citizens of the municipality to control a fringe area development. Saylors v. Jackson, 575 S.W.2d 264, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 689 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence at trial was ample to show that the growth of the city of Memphis would be inhibited if Cordova was not annexed and was allowed to incorporate as planned, and that annexation was reasonable taking into consideration the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and property owners of the area to be annexed. Vollmer v. Memphis, 792 S.W.2d 446, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 208 (Tenn. 1990), rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 269 (Tenn. July 2, 1990).

        Although this statute unconstitutionally excepted certain municipalities from the burden of proving the reasonableness of an annexation ordinance, where an excepted municipality nevertheless sustained such burden of proof, the annexation ordinance was affirmed.

       <p>
        Prior to the 1974 amendment to this section if a trial judge decided there was evidence for and against the reasonableness of an ordinance, he had to withdraw the case from the jury and uphold the ordinance, but since the 1974 amendment the municipality has the burden of proving the reasonableness of the ordinance and those contesting the reasonableness are entitled to have the reasonableness submitted to a jury.

The plan of services shall comply with the requirements of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c51s6-51-102" target="_self">6-51-102</a></cite>, including the public hearing and notice requirements, prior to the adoption of the resolution. Upon adoption of the plan of services, the municipality shall cause a copy of the resolution to be forwarded to the county mayor in whose county the territory being annexed is located.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person or persons with personal knowledge of the mailing of the resolutions to each property owner of record pursuant to subdivision (b)(1)(A) may submit a notarized affidavit to the presiding officer of the municipality attesting that such resolutions were mailed in accordance with this subdivision (b)(1). Failure of a property owner to receive a notice that was mailed pursuant to subdivision (b)(1)(A) shall not be grounds to invalidate the annexation.
      </p>
      <p>
       After receiving the notice from the municipality as provided in subdivision (b)(1), the county mayor shall notify the appropriate departments within the county regarding the information received from the municipality.

       Compiler's Notes. Acts 2015, ch. 512, § 18 provided that the act take effect at 12:01 a.m. on May 16, 2015.  However, the governor signed the act and it became law on May 20, 2015.  Pursuant to Article II, § 20, of the Constitution of Tennessee, the act takes effect 40 days after the bill became law.  Thus, the effective date of the act is June 29, 2015.

      <p>
       Amendments. The 2014 amendment, effective May 16, 2015, in (a), added the proviso at the end of the first sentence and added the second and third sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2015 amendment rewrote the fifth sentence of (b)(1)(A), which read: “The plan of services shall address the same services and timing of services as required in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c51s6-51-102" target="_self">6-51-102</a></cite>” and added subsections (c) and (d).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment deleted former (d)(5) which read: “This subsection (d) shall only apply in any county having a population according to the most recent decennial census that is greater than forty-four and one-half percent (44.5%) and fifty thousand (50,000) of its population in the preceding decennial census.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2018 amendment added (a)(2); and, in present (a)(1), deleted the former last sentence which read: “A resolution to effectuate annexation of any property, with written consent of the property owner or owners, shall not require a referendum.”

The 2015 amendment deleted (e) which read, “(e) If the ordinance of annexation of the larger municipality does not receive final approval within one hundred eighty (180) days after having passed its first reading, the proceeding shall be void and a smaller municipality shall have priority with respect to annexation of the territory; provided, that its annexation ordinance shall likewise be adopted upon final passage within one hundred eighty (180) days after having passed its first reading.” and (g) which read, “(g) A smaller municipality may, by ordinance, extend its corporate limits by annexation of any contiguous territory, when such territory within the corporate limits of a larger municipality is less than seventy-five (75) acres in area, is not populated, is separated from the larger municipality by a limited access express highway, its access ramps or service roads, and is not the site of industrial plant development. The provisions of this chapter relative to the adoption of a plan of service and the submission of same to a local planning commission, if there be such, shall not be required of the smaller municipality for such annexation.”

        Court erred in finding that larger town waited too late to assert its statutory priority because larger town's annexation proceedings were initiated prior to the effective date of smaller town's ordinance, larger town's proceedings had precedence, and smaller town's annexation proceedings must be held in abeyance pending the outcome of larger town's proceedings pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c51s6-51-110" target="_self">6-51-110</a></cite>; effective date of the annexation, not the date of final passage, was the operative date by which a municipality with a larger population must initiate annexation proceedings in order to take advantage of its statutory priority.

       A statute, purpose of which is to place the whole matter of all elections within a city in the council of the city, and to deprive the city of the benefit of the general election laws is violative of Tenn.

       Compiler's Notes. Acts 1995, ch. 209, § 3, referred to in (a)(2)(B), reads as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “That it is hereby determined and declared that the purpose of this act is to do that which the state welfare demands, and the state public policy requires:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a)  That the migration and loss of the people of Tennessee, who are compelled to leave the territorial limits of the state, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly to obtain employment and earn a livelihood be retarded and reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  That the conditions of unemployment existing statewide in Tennessee be relieved thereby reducing the evils attendant thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  That the average family income in Tennessee be raised and increased as much as possible, but to an amount at least the average over the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  That a means be provided for the citizens of communities to promote and develop industry in their areas, when it is possible for them to do so in their separate and individual capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  That a balanced economic development highly essential to the welfare of this state be promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f)  That the reconversion from war time and civil defense economy to peace time pursuits be expedited by a program for readjustment of employment to accord with employment problems necessarily arising from changed conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(g)  That the present and prospective health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment and the general welfare of the citizens demand as a public purpose, the development within Tennessee of commercial, industrial, agricultural and manufacturing enterprises by the several municipalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(h)  That the means and measures herein authorized to promote such enterprises are, as a matter of public policy, for the public purposes of the several municipalities, and the state of Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)  That the present and prospective promotion of health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment, and the general welfare of the state requires the measures that are herein and hereby authorized, and to that end will afford ready and attractive markets for farm and garden products, for the development of natural resources, and for the conversion of raw materials of farm, mine and forest into finished products for the general welfare of each of such municipalities, and the entire people of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(j)  That the accomplishment of the things herein authorized to be done by the several municipalities will give to them local benefits peculiar to each, and general benefits to the entire state.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 1995, ch. 297, § 3 provided that contributions made by municipalities in the past to the organizations authorized to receive contributions by that act are hereby ratified and approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendments. The 2017 amendment rewrote (c) which read: “(c)  Any nonprofit organization that desires financial assistance from a municipality shall file with the city clerk a copy of an annual report of its business affairs and transactions, which includes, but is not limited to, a copy of an annual audit, a description of the program that serves the residents of the municipality and the proposed use of the municipal assistance.

       On May 7, 2009, the senate adopted an amendment that included counties with a population of not less than 12,300 nor more than 12,368 to the counties to which this section applies pursuant to subdivision (c)(3). On June 11, 2009, the house of representatives adopted an amendment that would have added a new subsection to this section, under which the section would not apply to any county having a population of not less than 12,300 nor more than 12,368. The senate concurred in that amendment on June 12, 2009. Because the house of representatives amendment removed the authorization for counties within that population range added by the senate amendment, and the senate concurred in that action, no language regarding such counties was codified.

                 The filing of the petition for review does not itself stay enforcement of the final order. The reviewing court may order a stay on appropriate terms, but if it is shown to the satisfaction of the reviewing court, in a hearing that shall be held within ten (10) business days of a request for hearing by either party, that any party or the public at large may suffer injury by reason of the granting of a stay, then no stay shall be granted until a good and sufficient bond, in an amount fixed and approved by the court, shall be given by the petitioner conditioned to indemnify the other persons who might be so injured and if no bond amount is sufficient, the stay shall be denied.
                </li>

                 Within forty-five (45) calendar days after service of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court, the administrative hearing officer shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all the parties of the review proceedings, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional cost. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.

                 If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the administrative proceeding, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the administrative hearing officer upon conditions determined by the court. The administrative hearing officer may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings or decisions with the reviewing court.

                 The procedure ordinarily followed in the reviewing court will be followed in the review of contested cases decided by the administrative hearing officer, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

Unless partial payment is made by electronic transfer of funds, if the municipality accepts partial payment within ten (10) days of the delinquency date, or at any time following such delinquency date, then prior to accepting such payment the municipality must inform the taxpayer of the delinquency date and must advise such taxpayer that the property may be subjected to a tax lien and enforcement by tax sale or other legally authorized procedures.

        Trial court properly granted an industrial development corporation's motion to dismiss because nothing in the statutory scheme precluded it from procuring property outside the city's corporate limits to establish an industrial park as a joint venture between the city and the county; the comprehensive growth plan statutes were not specifically related to the corporation's role in procuring the property for development of an industrial park.
