However, the history line for the section has been updated to reflect the amendment by that act. Section 7 of that act provided that 1989 amendments shall only apply to counties having a population of more than two hundred thousand (200,000), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent census, and having only two (2) municipalities within the county.

      Acts 1989, ch. 576, § 2, effective June 8, 1989, amended (1)(D) to read: “(D) Promptly after the adoption of the consolidation resolution by the governing body of a county, its clerk shall certify the fact of such adoption with a copy of the resolution to the clerk of the governing body of the principal city and the governing body of the principal city shall act upon such resolution within sixty (60) days of the receipt thereof. Failure of the governing body to so act shall render this effort at consolidation void. Promptly after the adoption of a consolidation resolution by the governing body of the principal city, the clerk shall certify the fact of such adoption to the clerk of the governing body of the county.”

       Charter provision that requires the trustee to remit daily all funds collected, relieves him of other functions and transfers the function of keeping and disbursing funds to the metropolitan treasurer, conflicts with the general law; however, being valid, it supersedes that law.

       Sections of the metropolitan charter requiring employees other than deputies to be employed according to civil service regulations and permitting the transfer of these employees to the trustee's office are valid, although they conflict with the general law authorizing the county trustee to employ deputies and other employees.

       For any county with a metropolitan form of government that has adopted a labor policy establishing the right of its employees to join an employee organization and that has a procedure for establishing exclusive representation status of an employee organization, an employee may be represented before any board, agency, civil service commission, hearing officer, or other body empowered to impose discipline or otherwise deal with wages, hours, and working conditions of employees by a representative from the employee organization that has been designated as the exclusive representative for such employees. Any such employee shall be entitled to select a spokesperson or representative for the purpose of providing aid and assistance in any proceeding before any such board, agency, commission, hearing officer, or entity, notwithstanding any other code section to the contrary.

Such representation does not include representation in any court of law, or in any judicial proceeding.

       The right of eminent domain can be constitutionally exercised only when the property owner is given reasonable notice of the effort to condemn his property, and a statute authorizing a condemnation of private property for public use must require such notice, either expressly or impliedly, or it will be void. The general municipal condemnation statute by necessary implication requires such notice, by the provision contained in this section that the property owner may appeal from the award made by the commissioners appointed to assess his damages.

       This statute must be liberally construed in favor of the rights of the citizen affected. Knoxville v. Harth, 105 Tenn. 436, 58 S.W. 650, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 88, 80 Am.

      <p>
       A change of grade for streets and sidewalks of a city is discretionary with the city. Stegall v. Chattanooga, 16 Tenn. App. 124, 66 S.W.2d 266, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A municipal corporation, together with railroad corporations occupying the street, on changing the grade of a street becomes liable for the resulting impairment of the right of ingress and egress to and from a lot abutting thereon, in an action for compensatory damages and not for the tort or trespass. Coyne v. Memphis, 118 Tenn. 651, 102 S.W. 355, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the destruction of shade trees was not a necessary incident to grading under this section, which was negligently done, the wrongdoer cannot be justified under the statute in a tort action. Lebanon v. Dillard, 155 Tenn. 448, 295 S.W. 60, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the city, and not a developer, is liable under this section. Knoxville v. Hunt, 156 Tenn. 7, 299 S.W. 789, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Town is liable to property owner for damages due to grading of state highway routed through town if property owner at time of issuance of deed covering right-of-way is not advised that highway is to be graded. McDonald v. Scott County, 169 Tenn. 374, 87 S.W.2d 1019, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where city was incorporated after county had assumed liability for taking land for highway purposes and damages incident thereto, city was liable to landowners for value of land taken within corporate limits and damages incident thereto where it recognized its liability and agreed with county to make payments out of funds loaned by county although county was not thereby relieved of its liability to landowners. Charleston v. Ailey, 210 Tenn. 211, 357 S.W.2d 339, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 426 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Flooding of land as a result of construction of highway amounted to a taking, the exclusive remedy for which was inverse condemnation, which was barred by the statute of limitations. Burchfield v. State, 774 S.W.2d 178, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 624 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988), appeal denied, 1989 Tenn. LEXIS 304 (Tenn. June 5, 1989).

       A municipal corporation may, by an ordinance, vest in its city engineer the power of establishing the grades of its streets, and, when the grades are established by him under such ordinance, the corporation will be bound by his acts, without any formal adoption or ratification of them by ordinance. Chattanooga v. Geiler, 81 Tenn. 611, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 78 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal corporation that permits a third person to grade its streets is liable for the damages resulting from the injury to the ingress and egress of the owners of abutting lots, although such grading was not authorized by any formal or valid ordinance or action of the city authorities. Knoxville v. Harth, 105 Tenn. 436, 58 S.W. 650, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 88, 80 Am. St. Rep. 901 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       City was liable for damage to plaintiff's property by virtue of removal of soil and trees from plaintiff's property in connection with widening of city street by contractor under contract with state. Wood v. Foster & Creighton Co., 191 Tenn. 478, 235 S.W.2d 1, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 461 (1950).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In the abutting landowner's action, damages for inconvenience resulting during the progress of the work cannot be recovered, but, it seems, this might be made the subject of an independent action. Acker v. Knoxville, 117 Tenn. 224, 96 S.W. 973, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The abutting landowner, whose line extends only to the margin of the street, has the same right of ingress and egress in respect of his abutting property to and from the street, as one whose line extends to the middle of the street and is entitled to damages. Coyne v. Memphis, 118 Tenn. 651, 102 S.W. 355, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The abutting landowner is entitled to compensation for the impairment of his easement of access to and from his abutting premises, resulting from the change of the grade, by lowering the street for the passage of ordinary traffic and by constructing an elevated railroad resting on supports, but at the level of the street before the change was made, notwithstanding such changes were made in the exercise of the police power. Coyne v. Memphis, 118 Tenn. 651, 102 S.W. 355, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       Abutting property owner is entitled to damages for the cutting off of ingress or egress by change of grade of existing highway, whether change be made from natural grade or an established grade. Knoxville v. Hunt, 156 Tenn. 7, 299 S.W. 789, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Abutting owner may recover though the change of grade is not on the side of the street where his property is located, if it decreases the value of that property. Knoxville v. Phillips, 162 Tenn. 328, 36 S.W.2d 434, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Abutting property owner is entitled to damages to portion of lot severed from main portion by the right-of-way of a railroad. Knoxville v. Phillips, 162 Tenn. 328, 36 S.W.2d 434, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landowners whose land was situated at street intersection could not recover additional damages against the city for raising the grade of one of the streets and the construction of a ramp intersecting street up to the raised street where it appeared that such damages were contemplated by the parties when they made a compromise settlement in condemnation proceedings by which the city obtained land for widening the street. Fuller v. Chattanooga, 22 Tenn. App. 110, 118 S.W.2d 886, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 11 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a portion of a street immediately adjacent to an owner's property is obstructed so as to destroy or substantially impair the owner's easement of access, such owner is entitled to compensation. Sharber v. Nashville, 27 Tenn. App. 625, 183 S.W.2d 777, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not authorize recovery of damages by property owner against city as result of city cutting limbs and branches from a tree standing between street curb and sidewalk so as to insure proper maintenance of city electric light poles, as use of street for light poles was a reasonable use and did not impose an additional burden on the fee of the property owner. Johnson v. Chattanooga, 183 Tenn. 123, 191 S.W.2d 175, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (1945).

      <p>
       Where plaintiff's property was near but did not actually abut on street on which the grade was changed but where there was evidence that her access to the property was damaged the court erred in directing a verdict for the city and the case should have been submitted to the jury. Sharber v. Nashville, 27 Tenn. App. 625, 183 S.W.2d 777, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).

      <p>
       In assessing damages where it appears that plaintiff's property is intersected by a number of easements of rights-of-way, the property is to be treated as a single tract since the fee to same remained in plaintiff despite the easements. Polk v. Memphis, 15 Tenn. App. 73, — S.W.2d —, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 76 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

        8. Measure of Damages.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The measure of damages is the difference between the market value of one's abutting property just before the grading and just afterwards, as for a permanent injury to his land. Acker v. Knoxville, 117 Tenn. 224, 96 S.W. 973, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The measure of damages where an abutting property owner has suffered injury as a result of a change in the street is the depreciation in the market value of the property by reason of the change made. Knoxville v. Phillips, 162 Tenn. 328, 36 S.W.2d 434, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1931).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Benefits and advantages and general increase in the value of property, shared in by a community as a whole, cannot be considered for the purpose of placing the same to the disadvantage of a particular owner who brings an action against a city for damages for change made in the grade of the street. Acker v. Knoxville, 117 Tenn. 224, 96 S.W. 973, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       To justify any deduction for the increased value of the property, the incidental benefits must be special and peculiar to that property, and not those common to all other property in the locality as incident to the improvements. Knoxville v. Barton, 128 Tenn. 177, 159 S.W. 837, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “all benefits accruing” means accruing to the owner, as the owner of the particular property affected and not as taxpayer or resident of the vicinity sharing benefits common to all. Knoxville v. Barton, 128 Tenn. 177, 159 S.W. 837, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1913).

       Prior to the Married Women's Emancipation Act the common law rule pertaining to tenancy by the entirety prevailed in this state, and under such joint tenure a husband represented the entirety so that in an action to recover damages to such property, resulting from change in the grade of a street, the wife was not a proper or necessary party to the action.

Oneida v. Hail, 21 Tenn. App. 70, 105 S.W.2d 121, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).

       Action arising out of interference by city with natural drainage of surface water did not arise out of this section so as to be barred because action was not brought within one year. Dixon v. Nashville, 29 Tenn. App. 282, 203 S.W.2d 178, 1946 Tenn. App. LEXIS 106 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1946).

      <p>
       The one-year statute of limitations set out in this section does not apply where a city creates and maintains a nuisance continuous in character, such as a road whose construction interferes with the natural drainage of the area and causes flooding of another's property. Butts v. South Fulton, 565 S.W.2d 879, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 279 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).

       In the abutting landowner's action, evidence of the cost of the building of a rock wall as a consequence of the grading, of the possible impairment of the right of ingress and egress, of the freedom of the property from the dirt and dust of the street as a result of the improvement, and of the rental value thereof, is admissible and should be considered in determining the damages, and a charge to that effect is proper. Acker v. Knoxville, 117 Tenn. 224, 96 S.W. 973, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1906).

      <p>
       In an action by persons owning property abutting upon a street that is being improved by a city, to recover damages resulting from a change in the grade of the street and sidewalk, testimony in direct contradiction to written instrument of release of the city from liability in damages resulting from such change of grade is inadmissible. Stegall v. Chattanooga, 16 Tenn. App. 124, 66 S.W.2d 266, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

      <p>
       In an action by abutting owners of property on a street, against the city to recover damages resulting from a change in the grade of a street and sidewalk in front of their respective properties, a waiver agreement set up in special bill by defendant city, which was put in issue by the pleadings, was competent evidence, and should not have been excluded upon objection. Stegall v. Chattanooga, 16 Tenn. App. 124, 66 S.W.2d 266, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

      <p>
       In an action to recover damages from a city, resulting from the change of street and sidewalk grade, to the injury of plaintiff's property, testimony as to a new agreement between the city and plaintiff pertaining to the change in the grade of the street, was not admissible, since a municipal corporation speaks by its minute entry of the resolution adopted by the corporation, where no estoppel is relied upon. Stegall v. Chattanooga, 16 Tenn. App. 124, 66 S.W.2d 266, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

       In an action by the abutting landowner, the court's charge that if plaintiff did not own the waterpipes running from the water main in the street to his property line, then any injury to such pipes should not be considered, was not prejudicial to the plaintiff, where a railroad company permitted to occupy the street with its road employed the water company, which owned the pipes, to repair or restore the water connections at the railroad company's cost.

       The requirement of a statute that paving improvements to be paid for by abutting property owners should be let under contract with the lowest bidder, competing on sealed bids after advertisement, is jurisdictional, and a failure on part of the city to comply renders the assessment unenforceable.

       Where a contractor was let in to do paving under informal contract and had performed a substantial portion of the work the letting of a formal contract to him upon advertisement for bids at that stage, would not be a mere irregularity but in substance a culpable effort to avoid the mandate of the statute as the city authorities made it impossible for any other contractor to make a bona fide competitive bid for the work.

       Legislature intended dual purposes under the Tennessee Revenue Bond Law, namely: (1) To operate the public utilities on sound business principles as self-sufficient entities so that services may be furnished to consumers at the lowest rate, and (2) To prevent municipalities from operating their public utilities as a source of gain or revenue for the municipality.

         Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, as a matter of public policy, municipal utility systems shall be operated on sound business principles as self-sufficient entities. User charges, rates and fees shall reflect the actual cost of providing the services rendered. No public works shall operate for gain or profit or as a source of revenue to a governmental entity, but shall operate for the use and benefit of the consumers served by such public works and for the improvement of the health and safety of the inhabitants of the area served. Nothing in this section shall preclude a municipal utility system from operating water and sewer systems as individual or combined entities. Nothing in this section shall preclude a municipal utility system from operating a public works system as a special revenue fund when the governing body of the municipality determines that it is in the best interest of the customers of the public works system and the citizens of the municipality. All water systems and wastewater facilities must utilize an enterprise fund for accounting and reporting its operations. Any water system or wastewater facility currently not operating as an enterprise fund must be doing so by July 1, 2016. To the extent of any conflict between this section and the Wastewater Facilities Act of 1987, compiled in title 68, chapter 221, part 10, the latter statute shall control.

User charges, rates and fees shall reflect the actual cost of providing the services rendered. No public works shall operate for gain or profit or as a source of revenue to a governmental entity, but shall operate for the use and benefit of the consumers served by such public works and for the improvement of the health and safety of the inhabitants of the area served. Nothing in this section shall preclude a municipal utility system from operating water and sewer systems as individual or combined entities. Nothing in this section shall preclude a municipal utility system from operating a public works system as a special revenue fund when the governing body of the municipality determines that it is in the best interest of the customers of the public works system and the citizens of the municipality.

Any water system or wastewater facility currently not operating as an enterprise fund must be doing so by July 1, 2016. To the extent of any conflict between this section and the Wastewater Facilities Act of 1987, compiled in title 68, chapter 221, part 10, the latter statute shall control.

         In addition to § 7-35-201, upon approval by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the legislative body, any municipality having a municipal sanitary sewer system may enforce the payment of fees or assessments charged for sewer or wastewater disposal utility services by filing an action in the same manner and with the same penalties and interest attached as provided for the enforcement of unpaid taxes pursuant to title 67, including the sale or execution of such property as provided in title 26, chapter 5, and the redemption provisions of title 66, chapter 8. Such action may be taken only once every calendar year by the municipal sanitary sewer system for unpaid sewer or wastewater utility fees or assessments. The municipal sanitary sewer system shall be required to give notice to the property owner, if different from the service user, not less than ninety (90) days prior to the filing of any action, which would include levying on the real property. Such notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the property owner as contained on the tax records of the county where the property is located, and shall include the amount of the unpaid fee or assessment for sewer or wastewater disposal services, together with penalties and interest. The notice shall also contain a statement to the effect that, unless the payments are brought up to date, a lien will attach to the property and an action will be filed pursuant to title 67. The municipal sanitary sewer system shall bear the reasonable costs incurred by a property owner in defending such an action due to an error in the records or fees of the system for the provision of such sewer or wastewater disposal services.

          The fact that a city imposes a water and sewage rate on customers outside its corporate limits that is twice the rate charged to customers within its corporate limits does not by itself establish that the higher rate is invalid. The rate is presumptively valid, and a party seeking to challenge it bears the heavy burden of proving that the rate is not just and equitable. OAG 14-46, 2014 Tenn. AG LEXIS 49 (4/14/14).

           If any municipality in Tennessee adopts a sewer fee ordinance which includes a minimum base rate charge payable by all sewer users, it is declared the public policy of the state that such minimum base rate charge shall be considered to be a local tax upon sewer users in the same manner that local property taxes are so considered. However, user fees paid in excess of the minimum base rate charge that are related to the volume or strength of sewage discharged shall be considered as user fees in the same manner in which electrical, gas, or water consumption is related to actual use.

          The fact that a city imposes a water and sewage rate on customers outside its corporate limits that is twice the rate charged to customers within its corporate limits does not by itself establish that the higher rate is invalid. The rate is presumptively valid, and a party seeking to challenge it bears the heavy burden of proving that the rate is not just and equitable. OAG 14-46, 2014 Tenn. AG LEXIS 49 (4/14/14).

       The associated municipality is authorized to transfer to an authority created pursuant to this chapter all of the associated municipality's right, title, and interest in and all the assets of the municipal electric, water, wastewater, and telecommunications systems, or any one (1) or more of such systems, including all real and personal property, tangible or intangible, and any right or interest in any such property, whether or not subject to mortgages, liens, charges, or other encumbrances, and all appurtenances, contracts, leases, franchises, and other intangibles must be transferred to the authority. The transfer must be authorized by resolution of the governing body of the associated municipality adopted on one (1) reading and must be accomplished through documents and instruments authorized by the resolution and executed by the officers of the associated municipality as designated by the resolution. A transfer of an associated municipality's electric or telecommunications system to an authority in accordance with this subsection (a) is not a disposition of assets for purposes of § 7-52-132.

       Upon formation of an authority pursuant to this chapter, a franchise is granted to the authority to provide within the corporate limits of the associated municipality any and all of the services that it is authorized to provide under applicable law and as set forth in its certificate of incorporation, subject to payment in lieu of taxes pursuant to § 7-36-122. Consistent with § 7-36-107(a)(6), the associated municipality may require such franchise or franchises for the provision of telecommunications services as are permitted under state or federal law.

       Upon transfer of an electric, water, or wastewater system from an associated municipality to an authority and the assumption or satisfaction of all obligations of the supervisory board, the jurisdiction and control of the associated municipality and the supervisory board over such system must be transferred to the authority, and the supervisory board having oversight over such system shall cease to exist.

       It is a condition of the transfer of a system from the associated municipality to the authority that upon the transfer the authority must either retire the associated municipality's bonds associated with such system by the payment of the bonds in full upon transfer, defease such associated municipality's bonds by depositing funds in irrevocable escrow for the payment of these bonds, or assume and agree to pay in full principal of and interest on such bonds of the associated municipality. Upon the assumption by the authority of the associated municipality bonds and its agreement to pay those bonds when due, the authority shall be fully obligated to pay when due, principal, premium, and interest with respect to those bonds with the same force and effect as if those bonds were issued by the authority. Bonds issued pursuant to this section must be secured by, and payable from, the revenues of the respective system in the same way as other bonds of the authority issued pursuant to this chapter. The transfer of each of the systems must be accomplished in such a manner as not to impair the obligations of contract with reference to the associated municipality's bonds and other legal obligations of the associated municipality and to preserve and protect the contract rights vested in the owners of such bonds and other obligations.

       This chapter is constitutional in that it does not authorize expenditure of public funds for private purposes or extension of credit to private corporations without approval of voters. Holly v. Elizabethton, 193 Tenn. 46, 241 S.W.2d 1001, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 331 (1951).
      </p>

Issuance by the corporation of one (1) or more series of bonds for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same project or any other project, but the proceedings under which any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds. Proceeds of bonds issued by the corporation may be used for the promotion of any of the purposes of the corporation as set forth in this chapter, including the establishment of a reasonable reserve fund for the payment of principal of and interest on such bonds in the event of a deficiency in the revenues and receipts available for the payment.

In connection with the issuance of its bonds, a corporation is authorized to enter into such additional agreements as shall be necessary to facilitate the issuance and sale of the bonds or establishment of the interest rate or rates, including agreements providing for liquidity and credit enhancement, and reimbursement agreements relating to the bonds.

         A causal connection between a police officer's work and his coronary heart disease was not shown where medical evidence established that the disease was primarily cause by hypertension, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia. Krick v. City of Lawrenceburg, 945 S.W.2d 709, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 254 (Tenn. 1997).
        </p>
        <p>
         Finding that the employee failed to prove substantial causation between his occupation and his coronary artery disease was proper because the city rebutted the presumption under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c51s7-51-201" target="_self">7-51-201</a></cite> and the employee failed to demonstrate that his occupation caused his coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease could be caused by family history, nicotine use, hyperlipidemia and obesity, in addition to hypertension, and several of those factors were present in the employee's case. Pittman v. City of Memphis, 360 S.W.3d 382, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 448 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 18, 2011), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 1197 (Tenn. Dec. 13, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         City's autopsy policy shifted the initial burden to show causation to the claimant/employee, and the policy requirement removed the statutory presumption by creating an additional requirement, an autopsy, before the presumption of causation attaches; thus the city's requirement that a claimant procure an autopsy before he would be entitled to death benefits was purely an administrative policy and was unenforceable. Pryor v. City of Memphis, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2020).
        </p>

         Statute presumes causation so long as the firefighter suffered from one of the health conditions in the statute and the condition was not present at the time of employment. Pryor v. City of Memphis, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2020).

        <p>
         Competent medical expert's testimony that police officer's coronary heart disease was not job-related but attributable to officer's smoking two packs of cigarettes daily was sufficient to rebut presumption of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c51s7-51-201ol1a1" target="_self">7-51-201(a)(1)</a></cite> and remove the analysis of the officer's disability from the purview of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c51s7-51-201" target="_self">7-51-201</a></cite>. Benton v. City of Springfield, 973 S.W.2d 936, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 351 (Tenn. 1998).
        </p>
        <p>
         Award of 18 percent permanent partial disability to the body as a whole to an employee was reversed, because the employer rebutted the statutory presumption of causation by presenting the testimony of a doctor that the employee's hypertension was not the result of his employment with the police department, but of multiple factors, including progressive weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle, and the employee conceded that he could not prevail if the statutory presumption was overcome. Bohanan v. City of Knoxville, 136 S.W.3d 621, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 2004).

         Legislature intended to give firefighters the presumption of causation contingent on the presence of an impairment of health caused by disease of the lungs, hypertension or heart disease, and on death resulting from such condition; although this presumption may be rebutted by competent medical evidence, there is no statutory requirement that the claimant procure an autopsy to receive the benefit of such presumption. Pryor v. City of Memphis, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2020).

        <p>
         Because the city's policy requiring an autopsy usurped the statute by placing a greater burden on the claimant, the policy was in conflict with the statute and was unenforceable; the trial court's decision to remand the case to the administrative law judge to try the case on its merits was not an abuse of discretion or otherwise erroneous. The trial court had such discretion under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. Pryor v. City of Memphis, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2020).

                  Claim that the Tennessee Adult-Oriented Establishment Registration Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c51s7-51-1101" target="_self">7-51-1101</a></cite> et seq., facially imposed an unconstitutional prior restraint on protected expression because it did not afford prompt judicial review of adverse licensing decisions was rejected. However, an ordinance related to the Act was overbroad under first amendment intermediate scrutiny, where the definition of “public place” was so broad that it was effectively all-encompassing, and the ordinance made no attempt to regulate only activities associated with harmful secondary effects. Odle v. Decatur County, 421 F.3d 386, 2005 FED App. 368P, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 18412 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2005).

                  Although certain adult entertainment establishments might have sustained harm from the adoption of the Tennessee Adult-Oriented Establishment Registration Act in the county, the establishments had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; public interest was served by minimizing the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.

                  Despite evidence that showed that hundreds of entertainers performed in plaintiffs' establishments every year, sometimes for only a few days, and in some instances, only one night, because the registry required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c51s7-51-1114ol1a" target="_self">7-51-1114(a)</a></cite> is necessary to determine what entertainers toured there, when, and whether they have proper permits, the provision is not more burdensome than necessary in furthering that interest; accordingly this provision is constitutional.

                     Plaintiff's equal protection claim did not implicate fundamental first amendment rights because plaintiff offered no evidence that the expressive content of live cabarets was different in any meaningful respect from that of the adult bookstores subject to the operating-hour restrictions imposed by the Adult-Oriented Establishment Act of 1995, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c51s7-51-1401" target="_self">7-51-1401</a></cite> et seq.; because the expressive content of the regulated live cabarets was virtually identical to that of adult bookstores, the act could not be said to discriminate against the expressive content of the bookstores and in favor of that of the live cabarets.

          T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c52s7-52-309" target="_self">7-52-309</a></cite> does have the effect of repealing the allocation provisions in private acts and charter provisions, but only those that “direct that the tax equivalent amount to be distributed to each taxing district is to be an amount arrived at by applying the current ad valorem tax rate in that district to the depreciated original cost of the electric system's tangible property …” It was this qualified repealer provision to which the legislature had reference in this section when it stated an attempt to repeal “certain provisions” of private acts affecting distribution, “but not to repeal any other provisions of such private acts.” Because Private Acts 1970, ch. 205 does not utilize the formula proscribed in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c52s7-52-309" target="_self">7-52-309</a></cite>, its validity is not affected by the repealer provision in this section.

For purposes of this part, an established arrangement is one under which the municipality has made a distribution payment to another taxing jurisdiction by general understanding, and the payment has been accepted by the taxing jurisdiction for the fiscal year or calendar year immediately preceding the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1987.

           Every municipality operating a utility system that includes an electric plant, whether pursuant to this part or any other public or private act or the provisions of the charter of the municipality, county or metropolitan government, that acquires an existing utility system from a municipality, electric cooperative or utility district, has the power and is authorized, but is not obligated, by action of the board or supervisory body having responsibility for such municipality's utility system, to retain and continue to operate as a separate retirement system any retirement system that was in effect on the date of such acquisition for the employees and retirees of the acquired utility system. Any such municipality shall also have the power and authority to modify, consolidate, amend, open, close and terminate the plans constituting such separate retirement system, and to establish such associated trusts as are necessary and prudent for the proper administration, operation and maintenance of such separate retirement system. Upon the effective date of the acquisition of a utility system in which an election is made to continue the operation of a separate retirement system, as provided for in this section, the assets and liabilities of the separate retirement system shall be transferred to the acquiring municipal utility system and, from and after such date, such assets and liabilities shall be the sole obligation and responsibility of the acquiring municipal utility system and the separate retirement system, but shall not be the obligation of any general retirement system that was in effect for the acquiring municipal utility system prior to the acquisition date. All such assets shall be segregated from the assets of the retirement system of the acquiring utility system and shall be accounted for separately. Such funds may be managed in the same manner as the assets of the retirement system of such acquiring utility system. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or diminish the vested rights of any participant in the separate retirement system of the acquired utility system.

        Acts 1965, ch. 344, which amended this section by adding “any planetarium and/or museum” to definition of project and whose title referred to the code section amended, did not violate Tenn.

        Planetariums and museums were public purposes under Tenn. Const., art.

        Because the proposed issuance of industrial revenue bonds to the university is part of a neutral program to benefit education, including that provided by sectarian institutions, and confers at best only an indirect benefit to the school, the issuance of the bonds does not violate the First Amendment. Steele v. Indus. Dev. Bd. of Metro. Gov't Nashville, 301 F.3d 401, 2002 FED App. 274P, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 16375 (6th Cir.

       <p>
        The nature of the institution is not the relevant inquiry in the special type of aid at issue; the nature of the aid conferred by the tax free revenue bonds is not direct aid, but instead, it is analogous to an indirect financial benefit conferred by a religiously neutral tax or charitable deduction: (1) The funding vehicle is available on a neutral basis; (2) No government funds will be expended, nor does any holder of a bond have recourse against the board or the city in the event of nonpayment; (3) The benefit to be obtained by the university is the same provided to private companies that create identical economic opportunities; (4) The conduit financing advances a clear governmental, secular interest in promoting economic opportunity; and finally, (5) The revenue bond program does not present the perception of government endorsement of religion.

        It is the intent of the general assembly by the passage of this chapter to authorize the incorporation in the several municipalities in this state of public corporations to finance, acquire, own, lease, or dispose of properties, to the end that such corporations may be able to maintain and increase employment opportunities, increase the production of agricultural commodities, and increase the quantity of housing available in affected municipalities by promoting industry, trade, commerce, tourism and recreation, agriculture and housing construction by inducing manufacturing, industrial, governmental, educational, financial, service, commercial, recreational and agricultural enterprises to locate in or remain in this state and further the use and production of its agricultural products and natural resources, and to vest such corporations with all powers that may be necessary to enable them to accomplish such purposes. It is further the intent of the general assembly to promote the control and elimination of all types of pollution that may result from the existence, development or expansion of commerce and industry within the state and that are essential to the economic growth of the state and to the full employment and prosperity of its citizens, but are accompanied by the increased use of processes and facilities and the increased production and discharge of noise, and gaseous, liquid and solid waste that threaten and endanger the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state by polluting the air, land and waters of the state. Therefore, the general assembly finds and determines that in order to reduce, control and prevent such environmental pollution, it is imperative that action be taken at various levels of government to require acquisition and installation of devices, equipment and facilities for the collection, reduction, treatment, and disposal of such wastes and pollutants, and that such actions heretofore or hereafter taken be effectively coordinated; that the cost of such acquisition and installation, if required to be assumed and paid by private enterprises without public assistance, would be unduly burdensome and would discourage or prevent their location in the state and would jeopardize their continued operation in the state; and that the assistance provided in this chapter, especially with respect to financing, is therefore in the public interest and serves a public purpose of the state in promoting the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state, not only physically by reducing, controlling and preventing environmental pollution but also economically by the securing and retaining of private enterprises and the resulting maintenance of a higher level of employment and economic activity and stability, and to vest such corporations with all powers that may be necessary to accomplish such purposes. It is not intended by this chapter that any such corporation shall itself be authorized to operate any such manufacturing, industrial, governmental, educational, commercial or agricultural enterprise, hotel, motel or apartment building or pollution control facility.

        The certificate of incorporation may at any time and from time to time be amended so as to make any changes in the certificate of incorporation and add any provisions to the certificate of incorporation that might have been included in the certificate of incorporation in the first instance. Any such amendment shall be effected in the following manner: the members of the board of directors of the corporation shall file with the governing body of the municipality an application in writing seeking permission to amend the certificate of incorporation, specifying in such application the amendment proposed to be made. Such governing body shall consider such application and, if it shall by appropriate resolution duly find and determine that it is wise, expedient, necessary or advisable that the proposed amendment be made and shall authorize the same to be made, and shall approve the form of the proposed amendment, then the persons making such application shall execute an instrument embodying the amendment specified in such application, and shall file the instrument with the secretary of state. The proposed amendment shall be subscribed and acknowledged by each member of the board of directors before an officer authorized by the laws of Tennessee to take acknowledgments to deeds. The secretary of state shall then examine the proposed amendment and, if the secretary of state finds that there has been compliance with the requirements of this section and the proposed amendment is within the scope of what might be included in an original certificate of incorporation, the secretary of state shall approve the amendment and record it in an appropriate book in the secretary of state's office. When such amendment has been so made, filed and approved, it shall then become effective and the certificate of incorporation shall then be amended to the extent provided in the amendment.

        Compiler's Notes. Acts 2017, ch. 431, § 1 provided, in part, that the  Tennessee advisory commission on intergovernmental relations (TACIR) is directed to perform a study of the payment in lieu of ad valorem tax agreements and leases entered into by industrial development corporations organized by municipalities, and specifically, whether economic benefits are derived from limiting the length of term of an agreement or lease in the absence of county approval or an agreement by the corporation or municipality to pay the county a sum equal to the amount of real property tax that would have been assessed in the absence of the agreement or lease following the expiration of the initial term.

        <p>
         The corporation shall have a board of directors in which all powers of the corporation shall be vested and which shall consist of any number, not less than seven (7), all of whom shall be duly qualified electors of and taxpayers in the municipality. The directors shall serve as such without compensation, except that they shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses incurred in and about the performance of their duties, unless otherwise authorized by local ordinance or resolution. No director shall be an officer or employee of the municipality. The directors shall be elected by the governing body of the municipality, and they shall be so elected that they shall hold office for staggered terms. At the time of the election of the first board of directors, the governing body of the municipality shall divide the directors into three (3) groups containing as near equal whole numbers as may be possible. The first term of the directors included in the first group shall be two (2) years, the first term of the directors included in the second group shall be four (4) years, the first term of the directors included in the third group shall be six (6) years, and thereafter the terms of all directors shall be six (6) years; provided, that if at the expiration of any term of office of any director a successor to the director shall not have been elected, then the director whose term of office shall have expired shall continue to hold office until a successor shall be so elected. Except for corporations acquiring any hotel, motel or apartment building in the center-city areas of a municipality that has created a central business improvement district pursuant to chapter 84 of this title, if at the time of the election of any directors there shall be in existence in the municipality a chamber of commerce, board of trade, or other similar civic organization, the directors elected shall be chosen by the governing body from the membership of any one (1) or more of such organizations, unless, in the judgment of the governing body, there are no members of such organizations who are both suitable and available to serve as directors of the corporation; provided, that if the municipality has within its boundaries a closed or substantially downsized federal facility, including, but not limited to, a facility formerly operated by the United States department of defense or department of energy, a minority of the directors may be chosen from persons who are not residents of the municipality.

Such bonds may be executed and delivered by the corporation at any time and from time to time, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest, or both, may be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date of execution, may be payable at such place or places whether within or without the state of Tennessee, may bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, may be executed by such officers of the corporation and may contain such provisions not inconsistent with this chapter, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the board of directors whereunder the bonds shall be authorized to be issued.

Any bonds of the corporation may be sold at public or private sale in such manner, at such price and from time to time as may be determined by the board of directors of the corporation to be most advantageous, and the corporation may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions the corporation's board of directors may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance of the bonds. Issuance by the corporation of one (1) or more series of bonds for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude the corporation from issuing other bonds in connection with the same project or any other project, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds. Proceeds of bonds issued by the corporation may be used for the purpose of constructing, acquiring, reconstructing, improving, equipping, furnishing, bettering, or extending any project or projects, including the payment of interest on the bonds during construction of any such project and for two (2) years after the estimated date of completion, and payment of engineering, fiscal, architectural and legal expenses incurred in connection with such project and the issuance of the bonds, and the establishment of a reasonable reserve fund for the payment of principal of and interest on such bonds in the event of a deficiency in the revenues and receipts available for such payment.

         The 2016 amendment by ch. 588, substituted “comptroller of the treasury” for “state board of equalization” in (e)(1) following “submit to the”; at the end of the first sentence of (e)(2);  and at the end of the first sentence of (e)(3);  and substituted “comptroller of the treasury” for “board” preceding “or the assessor” in the second sentence of (e)(3) and at the end of the last sentence of (e)(3). The 2016 amendment by ch. 777, in (b), redesignated the former last sentence of (1) as (2) and rewrote the remainder of (1) which read: “The municipality has the power to delegate to the corporation the authority to negotiate and accept from the corporation's lessees, payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes; provided, that any such authorization shall be granted only upon a finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the corporation's public purposes as defined in this section; provided, further, that no contract, lease, understanding, or other agreement of any kind, including any renewal or extension of the agreement, entered into by a municipality or corporation to which such authority has been delegated shall permit payment in lieu of taxes to be waived or otherwise not assessed for a period of greater than twenty (20) years from the date of such contract, lease, understanding or other agreement, unless both the commissioner of economic and community development and the comptroller of the treasury have made a written determination that such agreement is in the best interest of the state. The corporation shall attach to each agreement an analysis of the costs and benefits of the agreement, in such manner and under such conditions as shall be prescribed by the commissioner of economic and community development or the commissioner's designee. The legislative body of the municipality making such delegation may, in its sole discretion, require the corporation to submit any such agreement to such legislative body for its approval.”, inserted “the Central Business Improvement District Act of 1971, compiled in” in the present introductory language of (2), redesignated former (2) as present (3),  and substituted “in subdivisions (b)(2)(A) and (B)” for “in subdivisions (b)(1)(A) and (B)” in present (3); and, in (e)(1), deleted former (F) which read: “(F) A calculation of the taxes that would have been due for each listed property if the properties were privately owned or otherwise subject to taxation;”, deleted “to the governing body” from the end of (H), and inserted “between the city and county” in (K).

      Compiler's Notes. Section 3 of Acts 1955, ch. 209, reads as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “That it is hereby determined and declared that the purpose of this act is to do that which the state welfare demands, and the state public policy requires:
     </p>
     <p>
      “(a)  That the migration and loss of the people of Tennessee, who are compelled to leave the territorial limits of the state, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly to obtain employment and earn a livelihood be retarded and reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b)  That the conditions of unemployment existing statewide in Tennessee be relieved thereby reducing the evils attendant thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c)  That the average family income in Tennessee be raised and increased as much as possible, but to an amount at least the average over the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d)  That a means be provided for the citizens of communities to promote and develop industry in their areas, when it is possible for them to do so in their separate and individual capacities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(e)  That a balanced economic development highly essential to the welfare of this state be promoted.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(f)  That the reconversion from war time and civil defense economy to peace time pursuits be expedited by a program for readjustment of employment to accord with employment problems necessarily arising from changed conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(g)  That the present and prospective health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment and the general welfare of the citizens demand as a public purpose, the development within Tennessee of commercial, industrial, agricultural and manufacturing enterprises by the several municipalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(h)  That the means and measures herein authorized to promote such enterprises are, as a matter of public policy, for the public purposes of the several municipalities, and the state of Tennessee.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(i)  That the present and prospective promotion of health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment, and the general welfare of the state requires the measures that are herein and hereby authorized, and to that end will afford ready and attractive markets for farm and garden products, for the development of natural resources, and for the conversion of raw materials of farm, mine and forest into finished products for the general welfare of each of such municipalities, and the entire people of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(j)  That the accomplishment of the things herein authorized to be done by the several municipalities will give to them local benefits peculiar to each, and general benefits to the entire state.”

       Because of the change in the agricultural economy resulting from the mechanization of farm operations, causing country people to move to towns and cities where work is available and causing emigration to other states where industrial jobs are available, the issuance of bonds under this act for the purpose of encouraging industry is for a corporate purpose and not in violation of Tenn.

      The construction, acquisition, reconstruction, improvement, betterment, or extension of any industrial buildings may be authorized under this chapter, and bonds may be authorized to be issued under this chapter to provide funds for such purpose or purposes or for the refunding of bonds theretofore issued under this chapter, by resolution or resolutions of the governing body, which may be adopted at the same meeting at which they are introduced by a majority of all the members of the governing body then in office and shall take effect immediately upon adoption. The bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates, payable semiannually, may be in one (1) or more series, may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their respective dates, may be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places, may carry such registration privileges, may be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium, may be executed in such manner, may contain such terms, covenants, and conditions, and may be in such form, either coupon or registered, as such resolution or subsequent resolutions may provide. The bonds may be sold in such manner and upon such terms as may be deemed advisable by the governing body; provided, that bonds for refunding purposes shall not be sold at less than par, but may be delivered in exchange for bonds to be refunded by the refunding bond. Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates in such form and with such provisions as the governing body may determine may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of bonds sold pursuant to this chapter. The bonds and interim receipts or certificates shall be fully negotiable within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, compiled in title 47, chapters 1-9.

        The authority is hereby authorized and empowered to condemn, in the name of the authority, any land, easements, or rights-of-way in the boundaries of the authority that, in the opinion of the board of directors, are necessary or convenient to carry out the purposes of this part; provided, that condemnation of any land, easements, or rights-of-way in which railroad lines are located shall be limited to such lines that are abandoned or proposed for abandonment by operating railroads in Tennessee as were contained in the previous provisions in Category I, 49 CFR 1121.20, as of 1983. Title to property so condemned shall be taken by and in the name of the authority, and the property shall thereafter be entrusted to the authority for the purposes of this chapter. Such condemnation proceedings shall be in accordance with title 29, chapters 16 and 17. Where title to any property sought to be condemned is defective, it shall be passed by the judgment or decree of the court. Where condemnation proceedings become necessary, the court in which any such proceedings are filed shall, upon application by the authority, and upon posting of a bond with the clerk of the court in such amount as the court may deem commensurate with the value of the property, order that a writ of possession shall issue immediately, or as soon and upon such terms as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper and just.

            The public purpose and policy set forth in § 7-57-102(a) is also declared to be applicable to any hospital authority created by private act of the general assembly, sometimes referred to in this part as a “private act metropolitan hospital authority”, the principal hospital facilities of which are located in a county in this state with a population greater than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census. For purposes of this part, “hospital authority” means hospital authorities, hospital districts, and hospitals owned and operated by one (1) or more local governments, directly or through an elected or appointed governing board.

           <li id="t07c57s7-57-501ol1b">
            The general assembly hereby finds that the demand for hospital, medical and health care services is rapidly changing, as is the way and manner in which such services are purchased and delivered; that the market for hospital and health care services is becoming increasingly competitive; and that the hospital and other health care providers need flexibility to be able to respond to changing conditions by having the power to develop efficient and cost-effective methods to provide for hospital, medical and health care needs. The general assembly also finds that the increasing competition and changing conditions force hospitals and other health care providers to develop market strategies and strategic plans to effectively compete. The general assembly further finds that public hospitals in metropolitan areas are presently at a competitive disadvantage, and that significant investments in the public assets of private act metropolitan hospital authorities could be jeopardized by inability to compete with private hospitals because of legal constraints upon the scope of their operations and limitations upon the power granted to public hospitals under existing law.

An incumbent cable service provider that obtains a state-issued certificate of franchise authority will be deemed to satisfy its affirmative obligation if the provider certifies to the department in its application for a state-issued certificate of franchise authority that it will deploy its cable or video system to all the households located within the proposed service area. An incumbent cable service provider that obtains a state-issued certificate of franchise authority and satisfies its affirmative obligation as provided for in this subsection (a) shall have an affirmative defense to an allegation of discrimination pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) with respect to new areas.

        It is hereby found and declared that there continues to exist throughout the state a seriously inadequate supply of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations, primarily accommodations for persons and families of lower and moderate income. This condition is contrary to the public interest and threatens the health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the people of the state and is inimical to the sound growth and the development of its communities. An adequate supply of housing of a variety of housing types serving persons and families of all income levels and properly planned and related to public transportation, public facilities, public utilities and sources of employment and service is essential to the orderly growth and prosperity of the state and the state's communities. Present patterns and methods of providing housing unduly limit the housing options for many persons in the state.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c60s7-60-102ol1b">
        It is further found and declared that one (1) major cause of this condition has been recurrent, cyclical shortages of funds in private banking channels available for residential mortgages. Such shortages contribute to reductions in construction starts of new residential units. In addition, these cyclical shortages make the sale and purchase of existing residential units difficult in many parts of the state, especially by those persons of lower and moderate income. The ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c60s7-60-102ol1c">
        It is further found and declared that the reduction in residential construction starts associated with such shortages causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the construction industry that results in hardships to many individuals and families, wastes human resources, increases the public assistance burdens of the state, counties, and municipalities, impairs the security of family life, impedes the economic and physical development of counties, cities and communities and adversely affects the welfare and prosperity of all the people of the state. A stable supply of adequate funds for residential mortgages is required to spur new housing starts in an orderly and sustained manner and thereby to reduce the hazards of unemployment and underemployment in the construction industry. The unaided operations of private enterprise, especially during periods of cyclical shortages of capital, have not always been able to meet and cannot always meet the need for a stable supply of adequate funds for residential mortgage financing.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c60s7-60-102ol1d">
        It is further found and declared that these conditions associated with such recurrent shortages of residential mortgage funds contribute to the persistence of slums and blight and to the deterioration of the quality of the environment and living conditions of a large number of persons residing in the state of Tennessee, have adversely affected the economy of the state as a whole and of the counties, cities and communities in the state, and are contrary to the declared policy of the state to promote a vigorous and growing economy, to prevent economic stagnation, to increase revenues to the state and to its counties, cities and other communities, and to achieve stable local economies.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c60s7-60-102ol1e">
        Based upon the experience of the past, shortages of funds for residential mortgages in the private investment system can be expected to recur from time to time in varying degrees of severity with the adverse consequences described in subsections (a)-(d). To bring greater stability to the residential construction industry and related industries, and thus to assure a steady flow of production of new housing units, counties or metropolitan governments having a population of two hundred thousand (200,000) or more, according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall be given the power to raise funds from private investors through issuance of bonds and notes to:

It is further determined and declared that the greatly increased use of motor vehicles of all kinds by the public has caused serious traffic congestion in certain areas of this state, and that inadequate parking facilities for vehicles have contributed to this congestion, not only to the point of seriously interfering with the primary use of such thoroughfares, but also of impeding rapid and effective firefighting and the disposition of police matters.

        In addition to any other procedure provided by law for the review of the actions of the board of commissioners, there is granted to the utility management review board the authority to review rates charged and services provided by public utility districts. The review provided for in this subdivision (1) may only be initiated by a petition containing the genuine signatures of at least ten percent (10%) of the customers within the authorized area of the public utility district;
       </li>
       <li id="t07c82s7-82-102ol12">
        To be considered by the board, the customer or customers initiating the petition must file a letter of intent to compile and file the petition with the board before the petition is signed. All signatures of customers on the petition must have been obtained within ninety (90) days of the date the notice of intent to compile and file petition is filed with the board. Each customer signing the petition shall include the address at which the customer receives utility service and the date the customer signed the petition. The petition must be addressed to the utility management review board and a copy of the petition must be served upon the board of commissioners of the affected utility district. The petition must contain the genuine signatures of the customers of the utility district. All information submitted in the petition must be legible;

The review provided for in this subsection (a) can only be initiated by a petition containing the genuine signatures of at least ten percent (10%) of the customers within the authorized area of the public utility district;  “(B)  To be considered by the board, the customer or customers initiating the petition must file a letter of intent to compile and file the petition with the board before the petition is signed. All signatures of customers on the petition must have been obtained within ninety (90) days of the date the notice of intent to compile and file petition is filed with the board. Each customer signing the petition shall include the address at which the customer receives utility service and the date the customer signed the petition. The petition shall be addressed to the utility management review board and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the board of commissioners of the affected utility district. The petition must contain the genuine signatures of the customers of the utility district. All information submitted in the petition must be legible; “(C)  Upon receipt of the petition, the board shall verify the names and addresses of the signers of the petition to ensure that they are bona fide customers of the utility district and to ensure that all signatures have been obtained within ninety (90) days of the date the notice of intent to compile and file petition is filed with the board. As used in this part, “customer” means a person who receives a bill for utility services and pays money for such services. Each utility account shall be entitled to one (1) signature, but no person shall sign the petition more than once. Only one (1) petition to review the rates and services provided under this section can be filed in any twelve-month period. The review by the utility management review board shall be held only upon public hearings, after notice;“(D)  For purposes of this subdivision (a)(1), “genuine signatures” means written, original signatures and excludes facsimile and electronic signatures of any kind;“(2)  The utility management review board shall review those petitions pertaining to rates on the basis of all provisions of this chapter governing the establishment of rates, the provisions of any bond resolutions or other debt contract instruments binding upon such utility districts, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the comptroller of the treasury pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c82s7-82-401" target="_self">7-82-401</a></cite>;  “(3)  It is the express intent of the general assembly that the review granted in this subsection (a) shall be a substantive and meaningful review. In order to accomplish this intention, the utility district shall take no action that will result in contractually binding the district or obligating the district to issue bonds that would require a rate increase, until the district shall have first given notice to the customers of the district of such anticipated action; and “(4)  The Uniform Administrative Procedures Act shall apply to all procedures and proceedings coming before the utility management review board pursuant to this subsection (a), to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter. “(b)  In those counties and districts specified in subdivision (b)(5), the following shall apply:“(1)  Except as to those districts coming within § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c82s7-82-103" target="_self">7-82-103</a></cite>, in addition to any other procedure provided by law for the review of the actions of the board of commissioners, there is hereby granted to the Tennessee public utility commission the authority to review rates charged and services provided by public utility districts. The review provided for in this subsection (b) can only be initiated by a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the users within the authorized area of the public utility district. The petition shall be addressed to the commission and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the board of commissioners of the affected utility district. The review by the commission shall be held only upon public hearings, after notice, in the county in which the utility district maintains its principal office;  “(2)  The commission shall review those petitions pertaining to rates as fully as in the case of private utility companies; provided, that the burden shall be upon the petitioners to show that the rates are discriminatory or unjust and unreasonable. In considering rate petitions, the authority shall take no action that adversely impairs the obligation of contracts or payment of existing bonds by such district, and may, within its sound legal discretion, assess costs of such hearings as equity and justice may demand;  “(3)  It is the express intent of the general assembly that the review granted in this subsection (b) shall be a substantive and meaningful review. In order to accomplish this intention, the utility district shall take no action that will result in contractually binding the district or obligating the district to issue bonds that would require a rate increase, until the district shall have first given notice to the users of the district of such anticipated action;“(4)  The Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, shall apply to all procedures and proceedings coming before the commission pursuant to this subsection (b), to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter; and“(5)(A)  This subsection (b) applies to any gas utility district for the reasons set out in § 7-82-103; and “(B)  This subsection (b) also applies in counties having the following populations, according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census: not less than  nor more than  13,600 13,610 28,500 28,560 28,690 28,750 48,400 48,500 84,000 84,100”

        Public service commission (now Tennessee regulatory authority) did not have jurisdiction to issue certificate of convenience and necessity to water company to operate a public water system in an area of a county where utility district had previously been granted authority by county judge (now county mayor) of that county to operate a public water system.

        Chancery court properly dismissed a public utility's complaint for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, while the utility had the right to provide water service, the gravamen of its complaint was to maintain its exclusive franchise by prohibiting a developer and a competitor from providing water service where the utility's averments were ostensibly an appeal of the PUC's refusal to issue a declaratory order—that the competitor was a “public utility” and was illegally operating without a certificate of public convenience—and the PUC lacked authority to grant certificates of public conveniences or to eject a competitor from an exclusive service area.

         Jurisdiction to determine whether public convenience and necessity requires that exclusive right of utility district to furnish services be revoked rests in the county judge or chair (now county mayor) of the county in which the petition for incorporation was presented and granted. Crossville v. Middle Tennessee Utility Dist., 208 Tenn. 268, 345 S.W.2d 865, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1961). But see White House Gas Utility Dist. v. Cross Plains Natural Gas Utility Dist., 60 Tenn.

         County executive (now county mayor) was not authorized to modify the boundaries of an existing utility district, even though the district did not provide service to area residents; the sole remedy was to seek to modify the utility's exclusive franchise if public convenience and necessity so demanded.

          Where utility district did not refuse service but terms on which service was offered was less advantageous than that which could be obtained from another source, chancery court had no authority to authorize applicant to obtain service from such other source. Chandler Inv. Co. v. Whitehaven Utility Dist., 44 Tenn. App. 1, 311 S.W.2d 603, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

          Where subdivision was within the territorial limits of utility district, builder of subdivision could not obtain right to contract with city instead of utility district for water service by declaratory judgment proceedings in chancery court, but sole recourse was to petition under the provisions of this section. Chandler Inv. Co. v. Whitehaven Utility Dist., 44 Tenn. App. 1, 311 S.W.2d 603, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

          Chancery court properly dismissed a public utility's complaint for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, while the utility had the right to provide water service, the gravamen of its complaint was to maintain its exclusive franchise by prohibiting a developer and a competitor from providing water service where the utility's averments were ostensibly an appeal of the PUC's refusal to issue a declaratory order—that the competitor was a “public utility” and was illegally operating without a certificate of public convenience—and the PUC lacked authority to grant certificates of public conveniences or to eject a competitor from an exclusive service area.

          A contract made by a city in the course of its operation of a utility is in its proprietary capacity. Batson v. Pleasant View Utility Dist., 592 S.W.2d 578, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 355 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

          The governing body of a municipal corporation, or a municipal board or officer having authority to contract, may bind successors in office by a contract made in the exercise of proprietary or business powers, but may not by contract prevent or impair the exercise by successors of legislative functions or governmental discretionary powers.

(2)  Contributions accepted by a utility district pursuant to programs authorized by subdivision (b)(1) shall not be considered revenue to the utility district, and such contributions shall be used only for charitable purposes. (3)  For purposes of this subsection (b), a “charitable purpose” is one that provides relief to the poor or underprivileged, advances education or science, addresses community deterioration, provides community assistance, assists in economic development, provides for the erection of public buildings, monuments or works, assists in historic preservation, or promotes social welfare through nonprofit or governmental organizations designed to accomplish any of the purposes set forth in this subdivision (b)(3).

          Every utility district organized under Tennessee law is both empowered to fix and revise all its rates and charges and required to maintain the amounts of such rates and charges so they will always be adequate not only to maintain its system but also to pay when due all bonds and interest thereon, including reserves therefor.

          The powers granted under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c82s7-82-304" target="_self">7-82-304</a></cite> are general corporate powers necessary for the transaction of the district's business. The exercise of these powers is, however, limited by the heading of this section “Powers in carrying out purposes.” Those powers granted under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c82s7-82-305" target="_self">7-82-305</a></cite> can be exercised only in furtherance of the purposes for which the district was created.

         <p>
          A utility district is not created for the purpose of conveying itself out of existence. The power to sell all its assets and its system to a private enterprise is, therefore, not an expressed or implied power of a utility district. United Cities Gas Co. v. Wigington, 815 S.W.2d 506, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 339 (Tenn. 1991).
         </p>
         <p>
          The power to develop and operate a public utility does not include the power to sell the system and terminate the corporate existence of the district. Disposal of all corporate assets of the district is contrary to, and in violation of, the duty to operate the district for the benefit of the district's customers. Under the Utility District Law of 1937, the obligation to operate the system can be avoided only by consolidation or merger with another utility district or transfer of the system to a municipality or a county.

          As a “municipality” operating its utility in a proprietary or individual capacity, the rules that control a private individual or corporate business generally apply. Batson v. Pleasant View Utility Dist., 592 S.W.2d 578, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 355 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

          A contract made by a city in the course of its operation of a utility is in its proprietary capacity. Batson v. Pleasant View Utility Dist., 592 S.W.2d 578, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 355 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).
         </p>
         <p>
          The governing body of a municipal corporation, or a municipal board or officer having authority to contract, may bind successors in office by a contract made in the exercise of proprietary or business powers, but may not by contract prevent or impair the exercise by successors of legislative functions or governmental discretionary powers.

          It has been held that state laws permitting a municipality to contract in its proprietary capacity suspend the municipality's power to regulate rates during the contract period. Batson v. Pleasant View Utility Dist., 592 S.W.2d 578, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 355 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

         Any district has the power to condemn either the fee, or such right, title interest, or easement in the property, as the board may deem necessary for any of the purposes mentioned in this chapter, and such property or interest in such property may be so acquired, whether or not the property or interest is owned or held for public use by corporations, associations or persons having the power of eminent domain, or otherwise held or used for public purposes; provided, that such prior public use shall not be interfered with by this use. Such power of condemnation may be exercised in the mode or method of procedure prescribed by title 29, chapter 16, or in the mode or method of procedure prescribed by any other applicable statutory provisions now in force or hereafter enacted for the exercise of the power of eminent domain; provided, that where title to any property sought to be condemned is defective, it shall be passed by decree of court. Where condemnation proceedings become necessary, the court in which such proceedings are filed shall, upon application by the district and upon the posting of a bond with the clerk of the court in such amount as the court may deem commensurate with the value of the property, order that the right of possession shall issue immediately or as soon and upon such terms as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper and just.

         Attorney General Opinions. Depending on the facts and circumstances, including practices among other utilities, costs of reconnecting, and past problems the district may have had in collecting water service fees, a reviewing court or agency could decide that actually removing a tap from a property for nonpayment is not reasonable because the same purpose could be accomplished by simply cutting off water service; similarly, based on the facts and circumstances, a reviewing court or agency could decide that charging a reconnecting fee to a new customer where a tap has been removed or allowing a new customer to receive service only if the customer pays the delinquent water bills of the previous customer is not reasonable or is not authorized because it improperly imposes on the new customer the debts of another party; and, based on the facts and circumstances, a reviewing court or agency could decide that charging a reconnecting fee to a new customer where a tap has not been actually removed is not reasonable because it is not related to the actual cost of providing the service, OAG 02-048, 2002 Tenn.

          Clearly, a utility district is not created for the purpose of conveying itself out of existence. The power to sell all its assets and its system to a private enterprise is, therefore, not an expressed or implied power of a utility district. United Cities Gas Co. v. Wigington, 815 S.W.2d 506, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 339 (Tenn. 1991).
         </p>
         <p>
          The power to develop and operate a public utility does not include the power to sell the system and terminate the corporate existence of the district. Disposal of all corporate assets of the district is contrary to and in violation of the duty to operate the district for the benefit of the district's customers. Under the Utility District Law of 1937, the obligation to operate the system can be avoided only by consolidation or merger with another utility district or transfer of the system to a municipality or a county.

        <p>
         Acts 1990, ch. 860, §§ 1 and 2 provided that with respect to any county having a population, according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, of not less than 19,200 nor more than 19,300, subdivision (f)(1) of this section is amended, effective April 12, 1990, by substituting: “As used in this subsection, ‘customer’ means any person who receives bills for services from the water utility district and pays money for such services,” for the last sentence in (f)(1), which read: “As used in this section, ‘customer’ means any individual who receives bills for services from the water utility district and pays money for such services and who resides within the boundaries of the water utility district.” Due to the limited applicability of the amendment by ch. 860, the act is deemed local in nature and has not been codified in the section set out above.

          Although the Utility District Act of 1937 has been amended several times since the Rector decision, the legislature has not modified the statute to create a uniform general law of statewide application in the context of selecting utility board commissioners and thus Acts 1990, ch. 861 does not unconstitutionally suspend that general law for the benefit of particular individuals in violation of Tenn. Const., art. I, § 8. First Utility Dist. v. Clark, 834 S.W.2d 283, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 364 (Tenn. 1992).
         </p>
         <p>
          Since utility districts such as the plaintiff are public, municipal corporations, subdivision (a)(1), U.S. Const., art. 1, § 10 and Tenn. Const., art. I, § 20, do not protect them from legislation amending their charters or altering their powers, and thus Acts 1990, ch. 861 does not unconstitutionally impair the plaintiff's obligations of contract. First Utility Dist. v. Clark, 834 S.W.2d 283, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 364 (Tenn. 1992).

          The general assembly did not delegate its authority, in violation of Tenn. Const., art. II, § 3 when it enacted Acts 1990, ch. 861, amending this section; instead, the amendment was governed by Tenn. Const., art. XI, § 9. First Utility Dist. v. Clark, 834 S.W.2d 283, 1992 Tenn.

          2009 amendments to this statute were not unconstitutionally vague since utility district commissioners of ordinary intelligence would be able to construe their fiduciary duty to act with utmost good faith for the benefit of their district and not themselves when exercising the duties, powers, and authority set forth in T.C.A. tit. 7, ch. 82.

          Application of the portion of the June 2009 amendments permitting the removal of utility district commissioners (UDCs) for failing to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities absent the elements of knowing or wilfulness was an impermissible retrospective application of law since before the 2009 amendments, UDCs could be removed from office only upon a showing of knowing or willful misconduct; the amendments attached a new disability to past transactions by removing the knowing and willfulness elements.

Acts 2009, ch. 398, § 1 provided that: “Notwithstanding subsection (f), thirty (30) days after the adoption of a resolution by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the commissioners of any water and sewer utility district to which subsection (f) applies, the applicable provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to per diem payments for commissioners of the utility district.

        <p>
         On September 8, 2009, the Huntsville Utility District of Scott County, the county to which former subsection (f) applied, voted to adopt the resolution; therefore, subsection (a) applies to that utility district and subsections (f) and (g) are repealed. Former subsections (f) and (g) read: “(f)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), for any water and sewer utility district in any county with a population of not less than eighteen thousand two hundred (18,200) and not more than eighteen thousand five hundred (18,500), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, the members of the utility district board of commissioners shall serve without compensation for their services, except that, by resolution duly adopted by the board of commissioners, each commissioner may receive per diem payments for not more than twelve (12) meetings of the board of commissioners in any calendar year at rates not greater than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) per meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
         “(2) Before any per diem payments may be made pursuant to this subsection (f), the customers of the utility district shall approve the action of the board in its resolution in an election. The board shall schedule a meeting of the district’s customers for an election for the approval of the resolution by the customers. At least thirty (30) days prior to such meeting, the board shall mail written notice of such meeting to all customers of the utility district. A majority of customers present and voting at the meeting shall approve the resolution.

        <p>
         “(g)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (f), thirty (30) days after the adoption of a resolution by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the commissioners of any water and sewer utility district to which subsection (f) applies, the applicable provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to per diem payments for commissioners of the utility district.

        <p>
         “(2) Upon the adoption of the resolution, subsection (f) shall be repealed.

         “(3) If no action is taken prior to December 1, 2009, or if the resolution is not adopted in accordance with this subsection (g) by December 1, 2009, this subsection (g) shall be repealed.

        </p>
        <p>
         The 2020 amendment by ch. 627, deleted “provided, that the education and training requirements pursuant to subsection (g) and not this subsection (f) shall apply to members of the governing board of a gas utility district” following “private act” at the end of (f)(9); and deleted (g) and (h), which read: “(g)  Subsection (f) shall not apply to any member of the governing board of a gas utility district who receives extensive annual training substantially equal to the training required pursuant to subsection (f) offered by an association of gas utility districts or directly through the gas utility district; provided, that the gas utility district submits the training curriculum to the comptroller for review and approval prior to use.” “(h) If a utility district provides both water and gas, then the members of the governing board shall be subject to the education and training requirements of either subsection (f) or (g) based on the predominate customer base of the utility district.”

          Clearly, a utility district is not created for the purpose of conveying itself out of existence. The power to sell all its assets and its system to a private enterprise is, therefore, not an expressed or implied power of a utility district. United Cities Gas Co. v. Wigington, 815 S.W.2d 506, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 339 (Tenn. 1991).
         </p>
         <p>
          The power to develop and operate a public utility does not include the power to sell the system and terminate the corporate existence of the district. Disposal of all corporate assets of the district is contrary to, and in violation of, the duty to operate the district for the benefit of the district's customers. Under the Utility District Law of 1937, the obligation to operate the system can be avoided only by consolidation or merger with another utility district or transfer of the system to a municipality or a county.

              In looking at the language of the statute, it is apparent that the legislature included wastewater treatment authorities in the definition of “utility district” in order to bring the authorities within the governing umbrella of the Utility Management Review Board for specified purposes that do not include the Part 4 administrative procedures. Am. Heritage Apts., Inc. v. Hamilton County Water & Wastewater Treatment Auth., 494 S.W.3d 31, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 269 (Tenn. Apr. 8, 2016).

             <p>
              2002 amendment to the Utility District Law of 1937 (UDL) was not intended to mean that wastewater treatment authorities are deemed “utility districts” for all purposes under UDL, but rather, they are considered “utility districts” only for the purposes specified in the statute; a review of the whole 2002 amendment package demonstrates that it was designed primarily to provide loan and financing options for water and wastewater treatment entities.

       It is hereby determined and declared that the deterioration of the central business districts of some cities and towns of the state by reason of dilapidation, obsolescence, overcrowding, faulty arrangement or design, deleterious land use, obsolete layout, or any combination of these or other factors, is a threat to the property tax and other revenue sources of such municipalities and is detrimental to the safety, health, morals, and general and economic welfare of the communities in which they are located; that the elimination of urban blight and decay and the modernization and general improvement of such central business districts by governmental action is considered necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare of such communities; and that restoration of such central business districts is an appropriate subject for remedial legislation.

        The general assembly finds and declares that the establishment of a uniform emergency number to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid is a matter of public concern and interest. The general assembly finds and declares that the establishment of the number 911 as the primary emergency telephone number provides a single, primary, three-digit emergency telephone number through which emergency service can be quickly and efficiently obtained, and make a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public service efforts requiring quick notification of public service personnel. It is the intent to provide a simplified means of securing emergency services, which will result in saving of life, a reduction in the destruction of property, quicker apprehension of criminals and, ultimately, the saving of money.

          The general assembly finds that the establishment of a uniform emergency number to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid is a matter of public interest and concern. The general assembly finds also that the continued viability of the lifesaving 911 emergency communications service is of the highest priority for the health and safety of the citizens of Tennessee.
         </li>
         <li id="t07c86s7-86-102ol1b2">
          The general assembly further finds that the effectiveness of 911 service depends on the ability of emergency service providers to timely respond to persons requiring emergency assistance; further, that the response by such providers is directly affected by the nature and coverage of the telephone and radio communications network available within a community, the quality of which is often limited by the availability of financial resources in the community.
         </li>
         <li id="t07c86s7-86-102ol1b3">
          The general assembly further finds that rapid technological advancements have provided the public with non-wireline services, including, but not limited to, commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) and IP-enabled service, which are capable of connecting users dialing or entering the digits 911 to public safety answering points (PSAPs). The general assembly also finds that in various rules and orders, the federal communications commission (FCC) has mandated wireless enhanced 911 service for all CMRS users and subscribers. The FCC also has addressed enhanced 911 service requirements for IP-enabled service. The general assembly recognizes that all subscribers and users of non-wireline services, including CMRS and IP-enabled service, which are capable of connecting users dialing or entering the digits 911 to PSAPs should share in the benefits of 911 service and should participate in the funding of the service.

       <li id="t07c86s7-86-102ol1c">
        Further, the general assembly finds that, while a competitive market for the public safety answering point equipment associated with the provision of 911 service is in the public interest, limited oversight by the Tennessee public utility commission of the provision of such equipment is also in the public interest. Therefore, public safety answering point equipment shall be regulated by the commission only for the purpose of adopting standards for the equipment and for the protection of proprietary customer specific information and to assure the integrity of 911 service and the privacy and safety of Tennesseans; provided, that such standards shall be consistent with the FCC Part 68 standards.

The general assembly also found that to more fully accomplish the purposes of the law, it is essential that each county have a uniform system of addressing which is consistent with regulations of the United States postal service in order to achieve maximum effect with minimum inconvenience to the public. The general assembly further found that the involvement of emergency communications districts in the addressing activity is necessary and complementary to the responsibility of local governments, which requires explicit definition.

In the event of any revenue shortfall, mandatory disbursements to the emergency communications districts and the TRS/TDAP program shall be given priority.

The department may deduct an amount, not to exceed two percent (2%) of collected charges, to be retained by the department to reimburse its direct costs of administering the collection and remittance of prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charges.“(d)(1) A seller that is not a provider shall be entitled to the immunity and liability protections under §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-319" target="_self">7-86-319</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-320" target="_self">7-86-320</a></cite>, notwithstanding the requirement in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-320" target="_self">7-86-320</a></cite>(a) regarding compliance with federal communications commission order number 05-116.“(2) A provider shall be entitled to the immunity and liability protections under §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-319" target="_self">7-86-319</a></cite> and 7-86-320.“(3) In addition to the protection from liability provided by subdivisions (d)(1) and (2), each provider and seller shall be entitled to the further protection from liability, if any, that is provided to providers and sellers of wireless telecommunications service that is not prepaid wireless telecommunications service pursuant to §§ 7-86-319 and 7-86-320.“(e) The prepaid wireless emergency telephone service charge imposed by this section shall be the only E911 funding obligation imposed with respect to prepaid wireless telecommunications service in this state, and no tax, fee, surcharge, or other charge shall be imposed by this state, any political subdivision of this state, or any intergovernmental agency, for E911 funding purposes, upon any provider, seller, or consumer with respect to the sale, purchase, use or provision of prepaid wireless telecommunications service.”

         The general assembly finds that the “Emergency Communications District Law” has been successfully embraced by the vast majority of Tennessee counties, most of which have already initiated basic or enhanced 911 service and are developing or maintaining this lifesaving service in furtherance of the purposes stated in the law. The general assembly also finds that the establishment of emergency communications services for all citizens of the state will promote the public interest. The general assembly further finds that statewide wireless enhanced 911 service is in the public interest.

         Amendments. The 2015 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “(a) There is created in the department of commerce and insurance an emergency communications board, referred to in this part as ‘the board’, for the purpose of assisting emergency communications district boards of directors in the area of management, operations, and accountability, and establishing emergency communications for all citizens of the state. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, the board shall, upon being constituted, exercise its powers and duties, in accordance with the provisions of this part, relative to all emergency communications districts established pursuant to this chapter or by any public or private act.“(b)(1) The board shall be composed of nine (9) members as follows: (A) One (1) member, appointed by the governor, who has no connection to emergency communications districts and who does not fulfill any other requirements for appointment to the board;   (B) The comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee. The appointment of the comptroller's designee to the board shall be for the term of office of the comptroller;  (C) One (1) representative of county government, appointed by the governor, who may be appointed from lists of qualified persons submitted by interested county services groups including, but not limited to, the Tennessee County Services Association; (D) One (1) representative of city government, appointed by the governor, who may be appointed from lists of qualified persons submitted by interested municipal groups including, but not limited to, the Tennessee Municipal League; and (E) (i) Five (5) members, appointed by the governor, who shall either be current directors of emergency communications districts or current members of emergency communications district boards of directors at the time of their appointment. The governor may appoint such members from lists of qualified persons submitted by interested emergency communications groups including, but not limited to, the Tennessee Emergency Number Association, or from a nominating resolution adopted by an emergency communications district. No more than two (2) members appointed pursuant to this subdivision (b)(5) shall be residents of the same congressional district. (ii) Nominations shall be made not less than thirty (30) days before the end of a term, and shall be filed with the governor and the board. In appointing members, the governor shall strive to ensure that the composition of the board represents the diversity of persons in Tennessee by considering race, gender, age, and geographical and political interests. (2) The governor shall consult with interested groups including, but not limited to, the organizations listed in subdivision (b)(1) to determine qualified persons to fill positions on the board.“(c) Members shall be appointed to four-year terms, except as provided in this subsection (c). Two (2) of the members appointed by the governor shall be appointed to serve an initial term of two (2) years, two (2) members shall be appointed to serve an initial term of three (3) years, and the remaining four (4) members shall be appointed for an initial term of four (4) years. The governor may select the members whose initial terms are less than four (4) years. Thereafter, such members shall be appointed and serve four-year terms. Members appointed by the governor may be appointed to successive terms.“(d) The board shall elect a chair and such other officers as it may deem necessary and appropriate. Such officers shall be elected for two-year terms.“(e) The board shall meet at least quarterly, and at the call of the chair.“(f) A quorum shall consist of five (5) or more members; and all official action of the board shall require a quorum.“(g) All meetings of the board shall be subject to the open meeting provisions of title 8, chapter 44, and the public records provisions of title 10, chapter 7.”

         Amendments. The 2014 amendment, effective January 1, 2015,  rewrote (c) and (d) which read: “(c) The board shall be funded through a charge on all commercial mobile radio service, established pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-108" target="_self">7-86-108</a></cite>.“(d) Any funds collected by the board shall be deposited in the state treasury in a separate interest-bearing fund to be known as the 911 Emergency Communications Fund. Disbursements from this fund shall be limited solely to the operational and administrative expenses of the board and the purposes as expressed in this part. At no time during its existence shall the 911 Emergency Communications Fund be used to fund the general expenses of the state of Tennessee.“(1) The board shall distribute twenty-five percent (25%) of the revenue generated by such a charge to each emergency communications district created either pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-105" target="_self">7-86-105</a></cite> or this part, based on the proportion of the population of each district to that of the state, according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census. Such funds shall be used at the discretion of each district for the provision of 911 service in accordance with this chapter. Such distribution shall be made thereafter as soon as possible in accordance with this part.“(2) The board shall also use such funds to reimburse emergency communications districts and commercial radio service providers for expenditures to implement, maintain, operate, or enhance statewide wireless enhanced 911 service, in accordance with  § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-306ol1a11" target="_self">7-86-306(a)(11)</a></cite>.“(3)(A) Any funds collected in excess of the annual fiscal requirements of the board, which shall include the payments to emergency communications districts established in subdivision (d)(1), shall not revert to the general fund. Any unspent funds at the end of a fiscal year shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year to be used as a beginning balance for the fiscal requirements for such fiscal year. The board may, at its discretion, and following policies, procedures, and criteria the board has developed, use any such unspent funds to provide grants for operating and capital expenditures for basic or enhanced 911 service and wireless enhanced 911 service to assist emergency communications districts created either pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-105" target="_self">7-86-105</a></cite> or this part. Such grants may be renewed by the board:“AFTER providing for all necessary and reasonable operating and administrative expenses of the board, which shall include the payments and grants established in this section;“AND AFTER implementing statewide wireless enhanced 911 service pursuant to standards established by the board, which shall include the present and future costs associated with required and necessary implementation, operation, maintenance, and enhancement of statewide wireless enhanced 911 service pursuant to the federal communications commission order, in accordance with subdivision (d)(2) and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-306" target="_self">7-86-306</a></cite>(a)(10);“AND AFTER establishing 911 service throughout Tennessee pursuant to standards established by the board;“THEN the board may distribute any excess revenue to each emergency communications district created either pursuant to § 7-86-105 or this part, for the purposes of promoting uniform 911 service, and those purposes stated in the law and this section. The board must first determine that such distribution is possible and practicable, does not threaten the solvency of the 911 Emergency Communications Fund, and is consistent with § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-306" target="_self">7-86-306</a></cite>.“(B) It is the intent of the general assembly that the board should distribute such excess revenue to emergency communications districts, as long as such distribution is consistent with this section.” and added (e) and (f).

         The automatic removal provisions of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-314ol1a" target="_self">7-86-314(a)</a></cite> apply, by their plain language, to ex officio emergency communications district (ECD) board members.  This does not create any conflict with the requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t07c86s7-86-105ol1b3" target="_self">7-86-105(b)(3)</a></cite> that certain officials serve ex officio as ECD board members. The statute allows those ex officio membership positions to be filled either by the specified official or by a representative of that official.  Thus, when an ex officio membership position is vacant because the specified official was automatically removed from the board, the statutory ex officio membership requirement is nevertheless fully satisfied when that position is filled by a representative of the official.  OAG 16-39, 2016 Tenn.  AG LEXIS 39 (10/11/2016).
