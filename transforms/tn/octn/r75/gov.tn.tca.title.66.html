        In determining what estate the grantor intended to convey, the deed as a whole is to be considered and the intention of the grantor gathered by giving all the words used their appropriate meaning.

        The first clause in a deed when in conflict with a subsequent clause, and the last clause in a will when in conflict with a preceding clause, must prevail; but this is only where there is an irreconcilable repugnance, and both clauses in the deed or will cannot stand. There is no such repugnance where the last clause in a deed does no more than extend and enlarge the first clause. Meredith v. Owen, 36 Tenn. 223, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1856); Frank v. Frank, 120 Tenn. 569, 111 S.W. 1119, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1908); Teague v. Sowder, 121 Tenn. 132, 114 S.W. 484, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the premises convey a life estate, and the habendum enlarges such estate to an absolute estate, the habendum is not repugnant to the premises, because it only extends and enlarges the estate given by the premises. Meredith v. Owen, 36 Tenn. 223, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1856); Teague v. Sowder, 121 Tenn. 132, 114 S.W. 484, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the husband's deed, by its premises, conveyed land to his wife, “and her heirs in fee simple forever,” and, by its first habendum, limited it to her sole and separate use and benefit, “with power to sell, and, by deed made and executed jointly with her husband, convey the said lot of land, and vest the proceeds in other property, to be held for the same sole and separate use as the property herein conveyed,” with the additional provision that, if the husband survived the wife, the land should revert to him in fee simple; and, by its second habendum, limited the land to the wife “and her heirs forever,” the husband, surviving the wife, takes the land, because such was manifestly the intention of the parties. Fogarty v. Stack, 86 Tenn. 610, 8 S.W. 846, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1888); Teague v. Sowder, 121 Tenn. 132, 114 S.W. 484, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where granting clause conveyed property to husband and wife, and habendum recited that the conveyance was to husband and wife as joint tenants for the period of their lives and upon their death the survivor was to take the estate in fee simple, and further provided that during their lives the land could be conveyed by their joint deed, the deed construed as a whole indicated an intention to vest the grantees a joint estate in fee. Hamilton v. Fowler, 99 F. 18, 1899 U.S. App. LEXIS 2790 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1899), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">176 U.S. 685</cite>, <cite class="s_court">20 S.

       <p>
        Where the granting clause of a deed conveyed land to the grantees, “their heirs and assigns forever,” with the exception of a homestead therein for the grantors, and the habendum was to the grantees “their lifetime and then to their heirs and assigns forever,” the granting and habendum clauses were wholly repugnant, and not being reconcilable by the aid of the context showing the grantor's intention, the granting clause creating a fee simple estate will prevail over the subsequent habendum granting a less estate. Teague v. Sowder, 121 Tenn. 132, 114 S.W. 484, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1908). See Laurenzi v. Atlas Ins. Co., 131 Tenn. 644, 176 S.W. 1022, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1915).

        An estate granted absolutely will not be cut down or destroyed by a subsequent clause in the habendum, which, if it raises any doubt, will be resolved against the limitation and in favor of the estate. Hicks v. Sprankle, 149 Tenn. 310, 257 S.W. 1044, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (1924).

        Where there is primarily a clear and certain devise of a fee about which the testamentary intention is obvious and without ambiguity the estate thus given will not be cut down or lessened by subsequent words which are ambiguous or of doubtful meaning. Smith v. Reynolds, 173 Tenn. 579, 121 S.W.2d 572, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1938).

       <p>
        Where granting clause provided for the conveyance of a certain tract of land to a named grantee and the habendum defined the estate granted as “in fee simple” but contained the immediate qualification that if the grantee did not dispose of the property in his lifetime and died seized and possessed thereof, then the fee simple was to pass to the grantee's daughter if she was living at the grantee's death, and where such daughter survived the grantee, the daughter took the land in fee simple on death of the grantee even though the grantee undertook to otherwise dispose of the property by will. Lockett v. Thomas, 179 Tenn. 240, 165 S.W.2d 375, 1942 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1942).

       <p>
        Courts refuse to cut down an estate already granted in fee or absolutely, when the supposed terms of limitation are to be found in some subsequent portion of the will, and are not, in themselves, clear, unmistakable and certain, so that there can be no doubt of the meaning and intention of the testator. Whitfield v. Butler, 30 Tenn. App. 221, 204 S.W.2d 537, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 79 (1947).

        Where testatrix conveyed her home to the devisee “to live in and not to be sold” the court concluded that testatrix's will passed a fee simple absolute in the home to the devisee, and the attempted restraint on alienation was declared void as inconsistent with the incidents and nature of the estate devised and contrary to public policy.

Graves for the sole use and benefit of herself and her heirs at her death and not to be subject in any way to the debts of her husband. The right to control the same during my natural life is hereby retained.” The remainder of the deed was in the regular form of a warranty deed. Such deed conveyed a fee-simple title. Graves v.

        If the expression in the will is doubtful, the doubt is resolved against the limitation and in favor of the absolute estate, and clause in will of childless wife bequeathing to her husband all her property, real and personal, “to be used by him for his support and comfort during his life” conferred absolute estate upon the husband. Green v. Young, 163 Tenn. 16, 40 S.W.2d 793, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1931).

        Doubt as to meaning of a will will be resolved against a limitation and in favor of the vesting of an estate absolute. The testator is presumed to dispose of his entire estate and not to die intestate as to any part or interest therein. Williams v. Williams, 167 Tenn. 26, 65 S.W.2d 561, 1933 Tenn.

        A deed to “Robert L. Johnson and wife Dortha Jane Johnson and her Dortha Jane Johnson's heirs and assigns” vested an estate in fee in the husband and wife as tenants by the entireties as against the contention that the phrase “and her Dortha Jane Johnson's heirs and assigns” manifested an intention to create in the grantees an estate of joint tenancy or tenancy in common, and the latter words were surplusage. Bost v. Johnson, 175 Tenn. 232, 133 S.W.2d 491, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1939).

        Will by uneducated man in his own handwriting which read “I want my wife … to then take in her perseson the remainder of all of my property boath real and personal and use as her Own for her surpoard in any way that her needs require until her death” vested the fee in the widow.

        Provision in will providing for division of real estate of testator between two sons after the death of his widow and providing that “if either or one of my sons, or both of them should die without children born to them” the land should go to his stepchildren meant death of one or both of the sons within the lifetime of the testator, and where the sons survived the testator both married son with children and unmarried son without children took an undivided half interest in the realty in fee upon death of the widow.

        The wife's right to homestead was not defeated by the fact that her husband made to her a voluntary conveyance of the homestead property, which conveyance was subsequently set aside at a suit by the husband's creditors, as the conveyance was merely fraudulent in law; thus her application for assignment of homestead was not barred, after remand to execute the decree, there being no question of homestead made in the original pleadings.

        A devise to a married woman and the heirs of her body created an estate tail at common law, but gave her, under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c01s66-1-102" target="_self">66-1-102</a></cite>, an absolute fee simple estate; and the addition of the clause “for her own sole and separate use during her natural life,” added after the word “body,” did not show an intention to convey a less estate than a fee simple interest, but merely had the effect of excluding the marital rights of her husband during her life.

To effectuate this purpose the mother will be converted into a tenant for life, and the children into remaindermen, the remainders vesting in the children living when the instrument became effective, and the estate opening upon the subsequent birth of children so as to embrace them; or else the mother will be held to be a trustee for herself and her then living children as well as her after born children.

        A deed of gift of slaves by a father to his daughter's children, heirs of her body, appointing her their guardian, to manage for them — hire out, if she pleases, or keep them until she pleases to deliver them to her children — vested in her children, then in being, the absolute title at that time, subject to her use and usufruct, with no estate in her. The words “heirs of her body” are descriptive of the persons who are to take, and meant her children then in being in this case. Bearden v. Taylor, 42 Tenn. 134, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1865); Johnson v. Hurley, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 258 (1876).

        A deed of conveyance of land, to take effect at once, to the heirs of a certain person then living, vests the title in that person's children then in being, and after born children take no interest in the land. Bearden v. Taylor, 42 Tenn. 134, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1865); Grimes v. Orrand, 49 Tenn. 298, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1871); Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1881); Livingston v.

        If a deed, when taken altogether, discloses upon the grantor's part that all the children of the mother, without regard to the time of their birth, shall become beneficiaries of the property conveyed, then to effectuate such purpose the mother will be converted into a tenant for life and the children into remaindermen, the remainders vesting in the children living at the time of the instrument and the estate opening to embrace other children subsequently born, at their birth; or else the mother will be held to be a trustee for herself and her then living as well as after born children. Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1881); Blackburn v. Blackburn, 109 Tenn. 674, 73 S.W. 109, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1902).

       <p>
        Where the conveyance of land is to the present and future children of a certain person, to take immediate effect, the title vests at law in the present children to the exclusion of after born children; but it is suggested that perhaps the living children as such grantees would hold the legal title in trust for themselves and the after born children. However, where there is a trust by deed or will, or a remainder is conveyed to present and future children of a certain person, or there is a postponement of the division or enjoyment of the property until they all come into being, the after born children will take with the children in being when the deed or will creating such estate shall become effective. Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1881); Blackburn v. Blackburn, 109 Tenn. 674, 73 S.W. 109, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1902); Scruggs v.

        A conveyance of land to a married woman, to have and to hold the same unto her as a separate estate, and to her children by her then husband, with a warranty of title to her, her heirs and assigns, operates to vest in her a life estate, and a remainder estate in her children by her husband, then living or thereafter born, and that may be living at her death. Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1881); Scruggs v. Mayberry, 135 Tenn. 586, 188 S.W. 207, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 197 (1915).

        Where a father conveyed lands to his certain daughter “and her children, forever” and in a subsequent clause provided that, in case the daughter died before her husband, he should have 400 acres of the lands for use and occupancy during his lifetime, which, at his death should go to “said children, bodily heirs” of the daughter, and that the daughter and husband be put in possession of all the lands and improvements to their own use, and that the husband should have control of the whole during her lifetime, and afterwards of the 400 acres during his lifetime; it was held that the deed created a life estate in the daughter in the whole tract and in her husband to the 400 acres, with vested remainders in her children living when the deed became effective, which opened and admitted the after born children, and that upon the falling in of the life estates, her children then living and a son of a deceased child took the absolute estate in the lands.

        A devise to a son and to his children, and if he should die during the life of the testator without children, then to his named sister and her children, creates a life estate in the son if he survived the testator with remainder to his children, and at the birth of a child of the son, the remainder would vest, subject to open and let in after born children.

        Under a deed giving land to grantor's son for life and providing that on his death it shall “pass to and vest in his issue,” the term “issue” includes grandchildren as well as children, and the children and grandchildren take per capita, unless a contrary intention can be found in the instrument itself; however, as a contrary intention was found, the children and grandchildren took per stirpes.

        Where a life estate or other particular estate is conveyed or devised to one, with an executory limitation or remainder over to another, and an absolute, unlimited, or unqualified power of disposition of the whole property or estate is given the first taker, it is a rule of property, regardless of the evident intention, that an executory limitation or remainder over, dependent upon the nondisposition of the first taker, is void, and an absolute estate is vested in the first taker; but, where the power of disposition given the first taker is contingent, limited, or qualified, the executory limitation or remainder over becomes effective when the property has not been disposed of within or according to the power; or where the power of disposition arises, by operation of law, as the mere incident to or consequence of the fee simple estate devised, the subsequent limitation over by way of executory devise is valid.

        It is a rule of property that an unlimited power of disposition gives the first taker an absolute estate, though in contravention of the actual or evident intention it is otherwise if the power of disposition is limited or contingent. McGavock v. Pugsley, 59 Tenn. 689, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1874); Pool v. Pool, 78 Tenn. 486, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1882); McKnight v. McKnight, 120 Tenn. 431, 115 S.W. 134, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1908).

       <p>
        Though the owner of a life estate, empowered to sell the property, thought that she owned the fee and conveyed in fee simple under that impression, without specifically intending to exercise the power to sell and convey, her deed was a sufficient execution of the power, since a grantor parts with all title she may or can convey, unless a contrary intention appears. Young v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 101 Tenn. 311, 47 S.W. 428, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1898); Matthews v. Capshaw, 109 Tenn. 480, 72 S.W. 964, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 88, 97 Am. St. Rep. 854 (1902).

Herrick v. Fowler, 108 Tenn. 410, 67 S.W. 861, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1901).

        The power of disposition to be implied from the mere ownership has no application to the rule that unlimited power of disposition vests absolute estate in first taker. Scruggs v. Mayberry, 135 Tenn. 586, 188 S.W. 207, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 197 (1915).

        A son's devise of land to his widowed mother “to and for her own use and benefit absolutely, provided that she does not marry again,” with limitation over to another in the event of her remarriage, does not invest her with an absolute estate in fee, but with a contingent estate in fee, determinable upon her remarriage. The estate did not become absolute in the mother, because the power of disposition was not given to her, either expressly or by necessary implication, by superadded words, as required by the rule. The limitation over is valid, and takes effect upon the mother's remarriage. Overton v. Lea, 108 Tenn. 505, 68 S.W. 250, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1901).

        A condition that not any of the property devised by a son to his mother shall go, by inheritance, devise, gift, or otherwise, from the mother to a named sister of the testator, or her husband, or their descendants, or any one of their name, and a limitation over that, in the event of any such disposition, the property shall go to another named person, is a valid conditional limitation upon such devise. Overton v. Lea, 108 Tenn. 505, 68 S.W. 250, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1901); Bradford v. Leake, 124 Tenn. 312, 137 S.W. 96, 1912D Am. Ann. Cas. 1140, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1910).

        Where the testator devised a life estate to his daughters, with remainder in fee to their children, and in default of children by them, then to the testator's children who should then be living, the remainder was vested in such of the testator's grandchildren, children of the daughters, as were in existence when the will became effective and contingent in the case of any daughter who at that time was without children.

        Under a devise or bequest of property to one, to be held by trustees for his use and benefit during his natural life, and at his death to be equally divided among his children, the gift becomes absolute upon his death with no children, for the testator did not, in that event, die intestate as to the remainder, so that the same would go to his heirs and distributees under the statutes of descent and distribution. Alston v. Davis, 39 Tenn. 266, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 291 (Tenn. Dec. 1858); Stretch v. Gowdey, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 37 (1872); Hottell v. Browder, 81 Tenn. 676, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1884).

        Ordinary words devising an absolute title will not, without superadded words giving unlimited power of disposition, defeat an executory devise. Read v. Watkins, 79 Tenn. 158, 1883 Tenn.

        In a partition of land among the absolute owners, the fee is not in abeyance while a remainder is contingent under a consent decree vesting in one of the parties a life estate in the part allotted to her, with remainder at her death to her children then living and the issue of such as may be dead, but the fee abides with her during such contingency, and, if the line of remaindermen is extinct so that there is no remainderman to take at her death, the remainder then ceases forever, and her title is freed from the remainder and subject to her disposal, by will, and her will devising the land to her husband becomes operative and passes to him the whole estate.

        Conveyance to a railway company of land “for railroad purposes only,” creates a personal covenant which is fulfilled by the location, of a railroad through grantor's tract of land, and is not to be construed as a limitation on the fee conveyed.

        Deed which conveyed to railroad company “the right of way and roadbed and 150 feet on east and 50 feet on west of said roadbed” did not purport to convey a right of way only, and under this section title to such land passed to the railroad in fee.

        This statute, which turns estates tail into a fee simple, creates a rule of property and its application ought not be made difficult by a broad construction of familiar words, which uniformly created an estate tail at common law.

        A word of limitation may be construed as a word of purchase, and a word of purchase may be construed as a word of limitation, where the context of the whole instrument manifestly and clearly requires it.

        Where the words “heirs” and “children” are used in different clauses of a deed or will, they will not be construed to mean the same thing, but the legal inference to be drawn is that the maker knew their legal meaning, and used them accordingly.

       <p>
        An “estate tail” is an estate of inheritance limited to the heirs of the body, or a particular class of the heirs of the body, of the grantee; and, on the failure of such heirs of the body, the estate shall revert to the grantor. Polk v. Faris, 17 Tenn. 209, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 32, 30 Am. Dec. 400 (1836), overruled in part, Harris v. Bittikofer, 541 S.W.2d 372, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. 1976); Kirk v.

       </p>
       <p>
        An estate tail may be general or special; it is general where it is limited to the heirs of the body of the grantee; and it is special where the limitation is to a special class of such heirs, as to the heirs of his body by a certain wife named, or to the heirs male or female of the body. Kirk v. Furgerson, 46 Tenn. 479, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        To create an estate tail at common law, it was necessary to use technical words designating a class of heirs to take in perpetual succession, or language disclosing a clear intent to that effect. Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1881).

        The statute, like the rule in Shelley's Case, is a rule, not of construction, but of property, and, like it, has relation, not to the wishes of the donor, but to the interests of the community. It tends to control individual purpose for the attainment of a public object, namely, the unlocking of property and the subjection of it to the uses of society. Polk v. Faris, 17 Tenn. 209, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 32, 30 Am. Dec. 400 (1836), overruled in part, Harris v. Bittikofer, 541 S.W.2d 372, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. 1976); Settle v.

        It matters not how distinctly, in point of intention, it may appear that the grantor means that the first taker shall have a life estate only; if it further appears that, by the use of the terms heirs of the body or issue of the grantee, he means the descendants of the first taker shall take, in their character of heirs, a descendible estate of inheritance, exhausting the lineal stock of the first taker, such purpose, by operation of the rule, will vest the first taker with the inheritance.

       <p>
        The word “children” is a technical word, and is always construed to be a word of “purchase,” unless it be so controlled by other words used so as to show that it was intended as a word of “limitation.” Kay v. Connor, 27 Tenn. 624, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 10, 49 Am. Dec. 690 (1848); Stubbs v. Stubbs, 30 Tenn. 43, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1850); Williams v. Sneed, 43 Tenn. 533, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1866); Bowers v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The word “children” is usually a word of purchase, requiring strong language to change it into a word of “limitation.” Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word “child” or “children” are words of purchase, not of limitation, unless controlled by other language of the will, and are not equivalent to the terms “heirs” or “heirs of his body,” as used in the statement of the rule in Shelley's Case. Collins v. Williams, 98 Tenn. 525, 41 S.W. 1056, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 244 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        The technical and legal meaning of the words “child” or “children” is the immediate offspring, and not an indefinite line of heirs. Collins v. Williams, 98 Tenn. 525, 41 S.W. 1056, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 244 (1896); Bruce v. Goodbar, 104 Tenn. 638, 58 S.W. 282, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1900).

        Under a deed conveying land to grantor's son for life and providing that on his death it shall “pass to and vest in his issue,” the term “issue” includes grandchildren, and the children and grandchildren take per capita, unless a contrary intention can be found in the instrument itself.

        The word “heirs” is a technical term, and is always construed to be a word of limitation and not of purchase, unless there be other controlling words clearly showing that a contrary meaning was intended by its use. Kay v. Connor, 27 Tenn. 624, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 10, 49 Am. Dec. 690 (1848); Randolph v. Wendel, 36 Tenn. 646, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1857); Cooper v. Coursey, 42 Tenn. 416, 1865 Tenn.

       <p>
        A testator, having only one brother and sister, bequeathed his entire estate to the brother “and his lawful heirs,” and, in the event of the brother's death without “such heirs,” then to the sister. As the testator had no children, the brother and sister would have been his heirs; and, as the sister would have been an heir of her brother, the phrase “lawful heirs” of the will must be taken to mean “children,” otherwise the sister could not take unless she were dead. The bequest to the sister was valid and was neither a perpetuity nor an estate tail which would by the statute be converted into an estate in fee. Boyd v. Robinson, 93 Tenn. 1, 23 S.W. 72, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1893).

        Under a devise of land to a son “and the heirs of his body, and if he should die without heirs, then * * * to his sister, Lucinda, and her heirs, that is, the heirs of her body,” there is nothing sufficiently clear to overturn the true technical meaning of the words “heirs of the body,” and nothing to indicate that the words were intended to be used in any other than the technical sense.

Clopton v. Clopton, 49 Tenn. 31, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 185 (1870); Ryan v. Monaghan, 99 Tenn. 338, 42 S.W. 144, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1897).

       <p>
        This statute has no application where one takes only an estate for life, and does not take an estate tail under the common law; as, where there is a devise to one for life, and then to the heirs of his body, and if he die without such heirs, then to another, the first devisee takes only an estate for life, with a contingent remainder over to such heirs, and, in the event of his death without such heirs, then to go to the other, this statute does not apply so as to enlarge the life estate to an absolute estate in the first taker. Williams v. Williams, 57 Tenn. 566, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (1873); Williams v. Williams, 62 Tenn. 55, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 137 (1873); Campbell v. Lewisburg & N. R.

        A devise to a grandson “during his life and then to the heirs of his body by a legal marriage,” refers to lawful heirs; and there is created a life estate with a contingent remainder in the heirs of the body of the life tenant. Campbell v. Lewisburg & N. R. Co., 160 Tenn. 477, 26 S.W.2d 141, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 124 (1930).

        Under a conveyance to one “during his life and at his death to his bodily heirs,” the named grantee takes a life estate and his bodily heirs living at the time of his death take the remainder. Guy v. Culberson, 164 Tenn. 509, 51 S.W.2d 500, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1932).

        Where the words, if applied to real property, would create an estate tail, they will, when applied to personalty, vest the absolute property in the first taker. Duncan v.

        The rule that where the words, if applied to real property, would create an estate tail, they will, when applied to personalty, vest the entire and absolute property therein was a well established principle of the common law, which was not affected by the rule in Shelley's Case.

       <p>
        The statute abrogating the rule in Shelley's Case gives no rights to “heirs,” to whom no remainder was limited, as against the devisees of one who was not only a life tenant, but in whom the fee abode subject to a contingent remainder to her surviving children or issue of children, when, by the extinction of the line of her descendants during her life, the remainder failed, and her title, at the moment of her death, became absolute. Bigley v. Watson, 98 Tenn. 353, 39 S.W. 525, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 230, <cite class="lra">38 L.R.A. 679</cite> (1897); Scruggs v. Mayberry, 135 Tenn. 586, 188 S.W. 207, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 197 (1915).

       </p>
       <p>
        The statute is not limited in application to cases where there are no heirs of the body of the life tenant, but applies whether the life tenant has such, and the estate of the first taker is limited to the life estate expressly given.

        What is pronounced to be a full and accurate statement of the rule in Shelley's Case is as follows: Where any person, by deed, will, or other writing, takes an estate of freehold, either legal or equitable, and in the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or without the interposition of an intervening estate of the same legal or equitable character, to his heirs or heirs of his body, as a class of persons to take in succession, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor or first taker to the whole estate. Polk v. Faris, 17 Tenn. 209, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 32, 30 Am. Dec. 400 (1836), overruled in part, Harris v. Bittikofer, 541 S.W.2d 372, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. 1976); Cooper v.

        The rule in Shelley's Case does not apply, and the first taker is not vested with the fee under devise of lands to the testator's two daughters, and to the survivor of them, if either should die without a child, and to be held free from the debts of their husbands, if they should marry, and to descend “to their children,” though the will was made and the testator died before the abolishment of the rule in Shelley's Case.

        The remainder to the children of a woman, who has an estate for life in the same property, is not extinguished until her death, although she may be very old and childless, as the law does not assume that there is an impossibility of issue at any age.

In default of such, then by executory devise to residuary devisee. Campbell v. Lewisburg & N. R. Co., 160 Tenn. 477, 26 S.W.2d 141, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 124 (1930).

        Where there is a devise to one for life and at his death the remainder expressed to go to the heirs of the life tenant's body, and there is no provision disposing of the reversion and no residuary clause, the named devisee takes a life estate with contingent remainder to his bodily heirs, and the reversion passes as intestate property to heirs at law of testator, ascertained as of date of his death. Manhattan Sav. Bank & Trust Co. v. Bedford, 161 Tenn. 187, 30 S.W.2d 227, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1930).

        The provision of this section is the equivalent of a conclusive presumption that the maker of the deed or will intended the limitation to take effect within the lawful period unless the contrary is expressly and plainly declared; and if the intention is doubtful, the statute must be applied and the limitation upheld; and no presumption of an intended perpetuity will arise by construction from the use of the terms of the statute. Armstrong v. Douglass, 89 Tenn. 219, 14 S.W. 604, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 39, <cite class="lra">10 L.R.A. 85</cite> (Tenn. Sep. 1890); Boyd v. Robinson, 93 Tenn. 1, 23 S.W. 72, 1893 Tenn.

        This section was enacted to change the common-law rule that the words “dying without issue,” and other equivalent terms, imported an indefinite failure of issue, a total extinction of descendants of the first taker, and that a limitation over dependent upon such indefinite failure or extinction, was void for remoteness, and as tending to create perpetuities, to avoid which the first taker was given an absolute estate.

        Such terms as “dying without heirs,” or “dying without issue,” import that the first taker is to die without leaving such heirs or issue living at the time of his death, or born to him within 10 months thereafter, as plainly expressed; and the statute applies to, and the legislative construction controls, every contingent limitation within the terms of the statute, “unless the intention of such limitation be otherwise expressly and plainly declared in the face of the deed or will creating it.” Armstrong v. Douglass, 89 Tenn. 219, 14 S.W. 604, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 39, <cite class="lra">10 L.R.A. 85</cite> (Tenn. Sep. 1890); Boyd v. Robinson, 93 Tenn. 1, 23 S.W. 72, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1893).

        A clause in a will, “I further direct that while said rent period is running that if any one or more of my grandchildren shall die, the remaining grandchildren shall receive all of said rents and profits,” was held to apply only to grandchildren living at the death of the testatrix. Eager v. McCoy, 143 Tenn. 693, 228 S.W. 709, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inasmuch as the heirs do not take by descent but by virtue of the remainder limited to them it follows that by the statute the first taker is deprived of any estate in the inheritance, and his interest is restricted in fact to what, under the rule, it was in form namely, a particular estate for life, and the will provided for a contingent remainder. Manhattan Sav. Bank & Trust Co. v. Bedford, 161 Tenn. 187, 30 S.W.2d 227, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1930), distinguishing Anderson v. Lucas, 140 Tenn. 336, 204 S.W. 989, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1918).

        The two pertinent rules of construction are: (1) If there is an immediate gift to A, and a gift over in case of his death, or any similar expression implying the death to be a contingent event, the gift over will take effect only in the event of A's death before the testator; (2) If there is an immediate gift to A and if he dies leaving issue, or without issue, over, the gift over will take effect only in the event of A's death before the testator. Johnson v. Painter, 189 Tenn. 307, 225 S.W.2d 72, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 430 (1949), citing Eckhardt v. Phillips, 176 Tenn. 34, 137 S.W.2d 301, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1939).

        Where testator used phrase “should either die without issue,” court was required to consider entire will in ascertaining whether testator meant death in his own lifetime or death at any time. Vickers v. Vickers, 205 Tenn. 86, 325 S.W.2d 544, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1959).

        This section does not require that limitation be construed as requiring death in the lifetime of testator where there is a clear expression by testator to make death of the first taker mean a death at any time. Vickers v. Vickers, 205 Tenn. 86, 325 S.W.2d 544, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the first-named devisee was granted only a life estate in the income produced by corpus of a trust with a limitation over in the event of death of the first taker without living children, the rule of construction providing that the limitation over would take effect only in the event of the death of the first-named devisee before the death of the testator did not apply. Shannon v. Union Planters Nat'l Bank, 537 S.W.2d 919, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 621 (Tenn. 1976).

       <p>
        Where deed contained provision that in the event the grantee should die without issue, the property should revert back to the grantors or their estate to be redistributed between their legal heirs, and also contained provision which would make the gift of the property an advancement to the grantee against her future inheritance from the grantors, it would be presumed that a reversion would take place only if the grantee died without issue before the death of the grantors.

        Before the enactment of this section, it was held that dying without issue, without heirs, and without heirs of the body, without more, or without any qualifying words to control, imported an indefinite failure of issue, heirs, or heirs of the body, a total extinction of descendants of the first taker; that a limitation over dependent upon such indefinite failure was void for remoteness, as tending to create perpetuities, and that the first taker took an absolute estate.

        Since, as well as before, the enactment of this section, perpetuities are unlawful, and when expressly and plainly declared, the contingent limitation that can take effect only upon the falling in of the perpetuity, will not be saved by this section, and the first taker will take the absolute title.

        After devising property to his wife and son testator provided that, in case of their deaths “and no heirs to them be left,” the property should revert to his brothers. Executors were authorized to dispose of property left to the son for his maintenance. “Heirs” did not mean children and absolute estates were created in wife and son. It was competent to show the quantity and kind of testator's estate and how lands devised to son were derived. Hennegar v. Deadrick, 54 S.W. 138, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 118 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1899).

        While the term “children” may be construed to embrace grandchildren, in view of the context of the instrument, yet such term will not be so construed where there is nothing to authorize its such enlargement; and where the testator devised a life estate to his daughters, with remainder in fee to their children, and in default of children, then to the testator's children who should then be living, the term “children” cannot be enlarged to include the testator's grandchildren.

        Limitations over dependent on a definite failure of issue, or a contingency which must happen, if at all, within the period of a life or lives in being, and 21 years and 10 months thereafter, are good executory devises, and will be upheld by the courts.

        A devise to the unborn child of an unborn child, eo nomine, is void, because it may not take effect within the period of a life or lives in being, and 21 years and 10 months thereafter; but when, by the express terms of the devise, the limitation over must take effect within the period of a life or lives of persons in being, then the reason supporting the objection fails, and the limitation over is good.

        It is an established rule in the construction of wills that where a devise or bequest is made to a person with a gift over “in case of” the death of the devisee or legatee, the gift over is contingent upon such devisee or legatee dying in the lifetime of the testator. Therefore, where a devise or bequest is made to A, and “in case of” his death, or if he die, to B, A surviving the testator takes the estate devised absolutely. Katzenberger v.

        It is not only a well settled rule of construction of wills, but a rule of property, that the words “die without issue,” as applied to the first taker, and upon the happening of which a contingent remainder or limitation over is to become effective, contemplate and mean the death of the devisee or legatee, without issue surviving him during the lifetime of the testator.

        Where there is a devise to a son and the heirs of his body, followed by a condition that if he should die without heirs, then to his sister, the fee simple estate thus created is not impaired by such limitation over, where the son survived the testator, since under the rule of construction and property these words would import the death of the devisee in the lifetime of the testator.

        Where life estate was devised to executrix with a limitation over and unlimited power of disposition, there was no significance in the fact that executrix was relieved of the necessity of filing inventory, giving bond or making settlement with court, and this section would convert it into a fee only if she actually disposed of the property and the limitation over would take effect as to the part undisposed of.

        In a case in which the owner of real property conveyed, by quitclaim deed, an interest to herself and her son as joint tenants, with the right of survivorship, and, a year later, the owner then conveyed her interest to her grandson by quitclaim deed, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the son ruling that he owned the property in fee simple because the owner transferred only her right of survivorship to her grandson, but that right did not come into play as she predeceased her son; thus, the son properly exercised his right of survivorship and became the sole owner in fee of the property.

       </h4>
       <p>
        Estate by entireties is a unit of indivisible parts, differing from a joint tenancy in the fact that the joint tenancy is a unit of divisible parts. The indivisible whole is vested in the husband and wife as two persons who are actually distinct, yet who, according to legal intendment, are one and the same. When one joint tenant died, the survivor took by the right of survivorship; but upon the death of the husband or wife, no new estate arises. There is a mere change in the properties of the legal person holding the originally granted estate, and the survivor takes no new estate or interest, nothing that was not in him or her before. Taul v. Campbell, 15 Tenn. 318, 15 Tenn. 319, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1835); Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v.

        A deed, conveying to one named and his wife, named, “their heirs and assigns forever jointly and severally in equal moieties,” was held to convey to the husband and wife as joint tenants or tenants in common, and not by the entirety; and, survivorship in joint tenancy being abolished, the husband could not convey the full title upon the wife's death, so as to bar her heirs. Myers v. Comer, 144 Tenn. 475, 234 S.W. 325, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1921).

        The same words of a conveyance which would make two other persons joint tenants under the common law, or tenants in common under this section, will make the husband and wife tenants by the entirety. Taul v. Campbell, 15 Tenn. 318, 15 Tenn. 319, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1835); Bennett v. Hutchens, 133 Tenn. 65, 179 S.W. 629, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1915); Young v.

        Tenancy by the entirety may exist whether the estate is in fee, for life, for years, or other chattel interest in land, and whether the property be in possession, reversion, or remainder. Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974).

        The granting clause in a conveyance to “William Farley and wife” is just as effective as if it had stated “to William Farley and wife, Cora Farley,” for it is not necessary that the grantee be described by name, if otherwise identified.

        This section applies to estates held in joint tenancy, and not to estates by entireties and does not abrogate the common law as to estates held by husband and wife by the entireties, because their such estate is not a joint tenancy.

        Where the rights of a prior purchaser do not intervene, a divorce of the husband and wife owning an estate by the entirety severs and destroys that estate as between them, and they then hold by the moieties or as tenants in common. Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974); Gillespie v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A marriage must exist when the conveyance is made, in order to create an estate by the entirety, for by a conveyance to a man and woman while single, they take by moieties, and if they afterwards marry they will continue to hold by the moieties, and not by the entirety. Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974); Hopson v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband had previously parted with his interest in the land before the procurement of the divorce, the decree of divorce is not effective to make the wife and the purchasers of her husband tenants in common. Whitley v. Meador, 137 Tenn. 163, 192 S.W. 718, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 64, L.R.A. (n.s.) 1917D736 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Estate by the entireties is not created by a conveyance to a man and a woman who are not under the marital bond, even though they are so described in the instrument; and such grantees would be tenants in common, even though believed by themselves and by the grantor to be husband and wife.

        By a deed conveying land to a husband and wife, they take but one estate, as a corporation would take, being deemed in law but one person with the legal existence of the wife incorporated into that of the husband; and, if one die, the estate continues in the survivor in the same manner as it would in the corporation, if a corporator should die.

        The widow could not be compelled to take her homestead or dower in land held by the entireties, because upon the death of the husband, the wife, as survivor, took the entire and absolute estate, and there was no estate left as that of the husband. McRoberts v. Copeland, 85 Tenn. 211, 2 S.W. 33, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 31 (1886); Jackson v. Shelton, 89 Tenn. 82, 16 S.W. 142, 1890 Tenn.

        Where in a deed by husband and wife conveying his land, a reservation or exception of a life estate in favor of both is made, such reservation operates as a conveyance; and upon the husband's death, it inures to the sole benefit of the wife in her own right, as survivor, by operation of law.

        Where a husband devises to his wife all of his estate, both real and personal, for life, and the only interest the testator had in any land was that in a tract of land held by him and his wife by the entirety, the surviving wife took the entire interest in the tract of land, and was not deprived of her estate therein, notwithstanding she took under the will, and accepted its provisions, for the doctrine of election is not applicable. Walker v. Bobbitt, 114 Tenn. 700, 88 S.W. 327, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1905); Rowlett v. Rowlett, 116 Tenn. 458, 95 S.W. 821, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1906).

       <p>
        Where land is held by husband and wife, as an estate by the entirety, the survivor, upon the death of the other, becomes vested of the entire estate by virtue of the deed conveying the land to them; and in such case the survivor does not inherit, acquire, or otherwise take any interest or estate in the lands from or through the deceased husband or wife, for the interest of the predeceased was terminated by his or her death.

        The purchase of the husband's interest not made in view of the contingency of the wife's divorce at some future period is not affected by an absolute divorce subsequently obtained by her for supervenient causes occurring after the marriage; but where the marriage is declared absolutely void from the beginning, the supposed husband and wife become tenants in common, and the supposed wife is entitled to her moiety of the land as against such purchaser. Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974); Gillespie v.

        The purchaser of an estate held by the entirety, either from the husband or at execution sale, holds the estate independently of the husband and all his future creditors, and entirely free from all future accidents or contingencies that might, as against the husband, if the title had remained in him, have, directly or indirectly, affected the estate. Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974); Gillespie v.

        Without the consent or the concurrence of the wife, the husband may convey the estate by entirety, either absolutely or as security for debt, or it may be levied upon and sold under execution for his debts but the conveyee of the husband, or purchaser at the execution sale, or a creditor redeeming from such purchaser, can acquire no other or greater interest than the contingent interest vested in the husband dependent upon his surviving his wife; and, consequently, such purchaser's rights are in subordination to the contingent right of the wife, who is entitled to the possession during the joint lives of herself and husband, and, in case she survives her husband, she becomes the absolute owner of the whole estate. Ames v. Norman, 36 Tenn. 683, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1857), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974); Berrigan v.

        This section does not apply to determine whether a joint tenancy was orally or impliedly created in personal property by the joint efforts of a husband and wife since the section is designed only so that either husband or wife can create an estate by the entireties without a deed to a third party to be reconveyed.

        Where it was unavoidably manifest by the granting clause of deed by clear and express terms that husband was conveying wife an estate by the entireties in entire tract of land referred to, such estate would not be negated or limited by later inept and incorrect references to one half divided interest in the property which the husband had obtained on the same day.

       <p>
        Since all vestiges of the common-law disability of coverture have been removed in Tennessee, each tenant in a tenancy by the entireties has a joint right to the use, control, incomes, rents, profits, usufructs and possession of property so held and neither may sell, encumber, alienate or dispose of any portion thereof, except his or her right of survivorship, without the consent of the other, and any unilateral attempt to do so will be wholly and utterly void at the behest of the aggrieved tenant, and any prospective purchaser, transferee, lessee or mortgagee acts at his peril.

       </p>
       <p>
        The abolition in Tennessee of the common-law disability of coverture does not abolish the estate of tenancy by the entirety but does strip it of the common-law restrictions on and deprivation of the rights of married women.

         1. Basis of Right of Inheritance by Alien.
        </span>

       <p>
        An alien has no inheritable blood, under the common law, and, if he take at all, he must do so under statutes of the state where the property is, or by the provisions of treaties. Baker v. Shy, 56 Tenn. 85, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1871); Ehrlich v. Weber, 114 Tenn. 711, 88 S.W. 188, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1905).

       <p>
        In the absence of a treaty, the right of a state to declare an alien capable of inheriting or taking property and holding the same within its borders is not precluded by U.S. Const., art 1, § 10, declaring that “no state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation.” Blythe v. Hinckley, <cite class="us_code">180 U.S. 333</cite>, <cite class="s_court">21 S. Ct. 390</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">45 L. Ed. 557</cite>, 1901 U.S. LEXIS 1309 (1901).

       </h4>
       <p>
        In case of a conflict between the statutes of a state and the terms of a treaty made under the authority of the United States, the treaty must prevail, because, by U.S. Const., art. 6, such treaties are declared to “be the supreme law of the land” binding upon the judges in every state, notwithstanding the Constitution or laws of the state may be to the contrary. Baker v. Shy, 56 Tenn. 85, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1871); Ehrlich v. Weber, 114 Tenn. 711, 88 S.W. 188, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1905); Couch v. State, 140 Tenn. 156, 203 S.W. 831, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 31 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every treaty concerning the right of ownership or inheritance of property made by the authority of the United States is superior to the Constitution and laws of any individual state, and if the law of a state is contrary to a treaty, it is void. Hauenstein v. Lynham, <cite class="us_code">100 U.S. 483</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">25 L. Ed. 628</cite>, 1879 U.S. LEXIS 1841 (Tenn. 1879).

        The status of alienage of a foreigner is presumed to continue, in the absence of proof that he has denationalized himself or ceased to be a citizen of his native country, and the mere fact of long residence in this country is not sufficient to overcome this presumption.

        Where a complainant based his claim upon the provisions of a treaty made under the authority of the United States, it is not necessary to make a formal claim of his rights under the treaty, since “the constitution, laws and treaties of the United States are as much a part of the laws of every state as its own local laws and constitution.” Ehrlich v.

        By construction, the statute embraces voluntary gifts and conveyances of lands, goods, and chattels, made by insolvent debtors, though without intentional fraud; but it does not embrace the absolute gifts of money, corporate stocks, and choses in action, made without any secret trust or intentional fraud, for the reason that, under this statute, there was no jurisdiction in chancery to subject a debtor's money, corporate stocks, choses in action, and the like, to the satisfaction of judgments against him, whether in his own hands, or in the hands of a voluntary donee, however, this jurisdiction was conferred in title 26, ch. 4 and title 29, ch. 12.

        The first part of this section embraces the essential provisions of the English statute contained in 13th Elizabeth, ch. 5, § 2, and protects creditors against fraudulent conveyances and dispositions of land, chattels, and every species of claims and choses in action; and the second part embraces the essential provisions of 27th Elizabeth, ch. 4, § 2, and protects purchasers against the fraudulent conveyances of lands only.

        The law sanctions and commands diligence and vigilance on the part of creditors, in securing their just demands; but in the race amongst them for priority, it forbids all resorts to covinous, guileful, or fraudulent devices and this section was intended to secure entire fairness amongst creditors in their efforts to secure their debts.

        The person who acquires property by fraud merely obtains title or a possessory interest in the property, and is said to hold this property in trust for its rightful owner. Such a trust is referred to as a “constructive trust” because it is “constructed” by a court of equity “to satisfy the demands of justice” and to prevent unjust enrichment. Stevenson v.

        A voluntary gift by a son to his mother, or by a husband to his wife, in the way of improving her real estate, done in good faith when both thought the donor to be absolutely solvent, though in fact he was insolvent, is not fraudulent as against his creditors; and the creditors of a husband cannot subject his wife's land in order to reach the money invested in the improvements by him, where the wife was not guilty of any fraudulent participation on her part, and was not guilty of positive fraud in the particular case.

        Where property is sold under several executions, some valid, and some colorable because contrived for the fraudulent purpose to defraud, a purchase by the execution creditors under the colorable and void executions, for the purpose of assisting in the scheme to defraud is fraudulent as against other creditors, because a purchase based on a consideration partly fair and partly colorable and fraudulent is within the statute.

        A mistake as to the amount of a claim secured where the amount is not capable of exact computation, as a surety's liability for a guardian's unsettled liability, not assumed to be stated accurately, but stated to be about double what it really was afterwards ascertained to be, does not render the deed fraudulent.

        Recital of payment in a deed is prima facie evidence of the fact requiring clear and satisfactory evidence to disprove it. Gaugh v. Henderson, 39 Tenn. 628, 1859 Tenn.

        A conveyance of land made by an insolvent debtor to his son in consideration of the satisfaction of the father's alleged indebtedness and of the son's note, claimed to have been paid before the filing of the bill, will be set aside as fraudulent against the father's creditors, where the son at the date of the conveyance was but a few months over age, and had no visible means wherewith he could pay the price, since the notes were in fact executed for no actual indebtedness, the conveyance was made to hinder and defeat the father's creditors.

        A registered voluntary conveyance of personalty or realty, made in consideration of blood or other relationship, and without fraud as against subsequent creditors or purchasers, will protect the grantee as against subsequent creditors or purchasers for value, and without actual notice of the registered conveyance; but such consideration is not good as to existing creditors.

        The statute does not discountenance a voluntary conveyance to a child or relative, or even to a stranger, if it be not, at the time, prejudicial to the rights of any other person, or in execution of any meditated scheme of future fraud or injury to other persons.

        A voluntary conveyance by husband to his wife, when solvent, and not in anticipation of insolvency, and without any intent to defraud existing or subsequent creditors, is not fraudulent as against creditors, especially is it not fraudulent against the creditors of a firm of which he is a member, debts of which were contracted without knowledge of the property conveyed to the wife.

        Where the maker of a voluntary conveyance or settlement was indebted at the time of the making of the same, it should satisfactorily appear that abundant means were reserved, and that the maker of the conveyance was not indebted to an amount sufficient for it to have the effect of delaying and defeating his creditors.

       <p>
        The inquiry is limited to the circumstances of the grantor at the time of the execution of the conveyance. Liabilities as an endorser, when there is no evidence that the persons for whom he was liable were unable to pay them, cannot be taken into account. Weaver v. Hawley, 2 Shan. 176 (1876); Lippman v.

        In order to sustain a voluntary conveyance to a wife or child, the proof must show, not merely a sufficiency of property retained to pay the creditors assailing the conveyance, but that ample property was reserved to pay all existing creditors at the time of the conveyance. Weaver v. Hawley, 2 Shan. 176 (1876).

        Where the responsible and solvent member of a partnership makes a voluntary conveyance to his wife and children of all his individual property, or practically all, worth from $60,000 to $100,000, while his firm owes at least $40,000, with assets of the nominal value of $90,000, consisting principally of notes and accounts not shown to be available to creditors, the conveyance will be set aside at the instance of the creditors of the firm. The court found that there was fraud in fact in this case. Levering v. Norvell, 68 Tenn. 176, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1877).

        Where a father, an old and ignorant man, moved by misrepresentation and false information of the existence of a judgment and execution against him, the whole thing being a conspiracy against him, for the purpose of extracting money from him, executed a deed to all of his property to one of his children, retaining for himself a life estate, and simultaneously took a bond from the grantee obligating herself to convey to each of his other children, at the death of her father, an equal share of the property, such deed and bond constituted a conveyance and settlement of his property upon all his children at his death, and will be enforced as between the children, because there were in fact no creditors. Such contract would be enforced, although designed to defraud the creditors of the father. Graham v. Lambert, 24 Tenn. 595, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 141 (1845).

        The mortgagor's power of continuation of the business by the sale of the goods mortgaged in the usual course of trade renders the mortgage fraudulent in law, and void as against his creditors; and it is immaterial whether such power is expressly retained upon the face of the mortgage, or is made to appear, aliunde, by other proof, either direct or circumstantial, as by the express oral declaration of the mortgagee, or by inference from the relation and conduct of the parties.

        A deed of trust including all the debtor's property, double or greatly exceeding in value the debt secured, with time of indulgence three years, with no annual payments stipulated for, and the possession and use of the property for that time expressly reserved to the debtor, and put beyond the control of the trustee, with power of sale reserved to the debtor to sell on credit for three years, with no other restriction but that he should pay the proceeds to the trustee, is at least fraudulent in law. Mitchell v. Beal, 16 Tenn. 134, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1835); Young v. Hail, 74 Tenn. 175, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 226 (1880); Hartman v. Allen, 77 Tenn. 657, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inclusion in the conveyance of considerably more property in value than the amount of the creditor's claim is not a decisive circumstance in the creation of constructive fraud, if the time of indulgence in the conveyance is usual and reasonable. Bennett v. Union Bank, 24 Tenn. 612, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (1845); Roane v. Bank of Nashville, 38 Tenn. 526, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 218 (Tenn. Dec. 1858); Stewart v. Cockrell, 70 Tenn. 369, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (1879). See Mitchell v. Beal, 16 Tenn. 134, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1835).
       </p>
       <p>
        If all the debtor's property, or a greater portion of it, be included in the conveyance, and if its value be greatly or considerably beyond the amount of the debt to be secured, the period of indulgence to the debtor becomes material; and if the indulgence is for an unreasonable time, the conveyance is fraudulent as against other creditors; but if the deed includes property of insufficient or only sufficient value to secure the debt, time ceases to be decisive, and would not of itself render the conveyance fraudulent. Bennett v. Union Bank, 24 Tenn. 612, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (1845); McCasland v. Carson, 38 Tenn. 117, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Sep. 1858); Roane v. Bank of Nashville, 38 Tenn. 526, 1858 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where both the excess in value of the property over the debt is considerable, and the time of indulgence is long, the evidence of a fraudulent purpose on the face of the instrument becomes greater, and that evidence becomes more and more pregnant in proportion as the excess in value increases and the time of indulgence is prolonged. Bennett v. Union Bank, 24 Tenn. 612, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (1845); Doyle v. Smith, 41 Tenn. 15, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1860); Hartman v. Allen, 77 Tenn. 657, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1882).

       <p>
        The extension of credit or the time of closing the trust for five years cannot affect other creditors injuriously, and does not vitiate a deed of trust, where it conveys property of no greater value than the debts secured. Roane v. Bank of Nashville, 38 Tenn. 526, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 218 (Tenn. Dec. 1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        Excess of property, where not too excessive, and extension of time for five years, will not render a deed of trust fraudulent as against creditors not provided for; especially where the excess of property is covered by a subsequent deed of trust for other creditors before the contesting creditors filed their bills.

        Where in a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, conveying all of the grantor's property subject to execution, a stipulation for a delay of nearly four years and six months is made, such deed hinders and delays creditors, and is fraudulent in law, and cannot be sustained.

        A deed of trust conveying land, which is all the property of the grantor that may be subjected to his debts, to secure debts of less than one-third its value, and stipulating for a delay of two and one half years before closing the trust, necessarily hinders and delays the unsecured creditors unreasonably, and is fraudulent in law.

        Where the object of the grantor in a deed of trust is to use the exemption laws as a mask for protecting his property subject to execution, by so mingling the exempt and nonexempt property as to hinder and embarrass his creditors, the deed is fraudulent.

        Where the fraudulent vendee relinquishes all claim to the property, and declares that it belongs to the vendor and not to him, there is nothing to resist vendor's claim as the rightful owner; and certainly a stranger to that contract, who may have possessed himself of the property, cannot resist the owner's title, on the ground that such property had once been the subject of a fraudulent contract.

        In a contest between the general unsecured creditors and the creditors secured in a deed of trust, fraud on the part of the maker, or of the maker and trustee combined, will not deprive the beneficiaries of the security or preference provided for them in the conveyance, unless they have participated in the fraud.

        No fraud can be attributed to a creditor for purchasing goods from his embarrassed debtor; and he is not liable to the debtor's other creditors, on the ground of participating in the debtor's fraud by aiding him where, with a knowledge that the debtor was much embarrassed, and probably was contemplating a fraudulent disposition of his property, but without intending to aid him in consummating his fraudulent purpose, or to hinder and defeat his creditors, he bought a stock of goods from the debtor, especially where the money thus paid by the purchasing creditor was used by the selling debtor in paying some of his other creditors.

        A deed of trust to secure a debt for trust funds embezzled or appropriated by fraudulent breach of trust is not rendered fraudulent as against the other creditors of the maker, upon the ground that he executed it in the hope and expectation that he would thereby avoid a prosecution where the secured creditor did nothing to excite such hope, and the deed was made and accepted by him without any knowledge of the existence of such hope and expectation on the part of the maker, or without any agreement, express or implied, to forbear or suppress the prosecution.

        The claims of the husband's bona fide creditors, or liabilities properly incurred on his behalf, existing prior to the application for divorce, must prevail over the rights of a wife for alimony; and such creditors who assert their rights by suit before her claim for alimony is ripened into a decree, or within proper time thereafter, have rights prior to hers where they are not parties to the divorce suit.

        Fraudulent conveyances or assignments made to defeat alimony are void as to the wife of the maker and will not even stand for the purchase money advanced on the same by the grantee, nor for advances he may have made, or responsibilities he may have entered into, on account of them.

        Where the grantee under a voluntary conveyance duly registered, with a secret agreement to reconvey to the grantor, obtains credit on the faith of his apparent ownership being real, his voluntary reconveyance, in accordance with such agreement, is fraudulent in law, if not in fact, as against his such existing creditors.

        A voluntary conveyance made by a husband to his wife and children is not void per se as to his creditors, but it will be presumed to be fraudulent as against his existing creditors, which presumption may be rebutted by showing the reservation or retention of sufficient property or assets to pay all his existing debts.

        A voluntary conveyance made to defraud subsequent creditors, though registered, is void as to such creditors, if they relied on the property, and had no actual knowledge or notice of the conveyance, and had no cause to suspect any fraudulent disposition of the property, or had the positive assurance of the debtor, given shortly before the creation of the subsequent debts, that all his property was in his own name and should so remain during his life, and be subject to his debts, especially where such creditors were existing creditors at the time of such conveyance and resided and did business in another state.

       <p>
        A voluntary conveyance, made by one heavily indebted at the time, and disposing of such a proportion of his property that it must necessarily operate to delay or defeat his creditors, is fraudulent as to debts subsequently created with existing creditors, though the existing debts are paid, and though the deed is duly registered, where the creditors, residing and doing business in another state, have no actual knowledge or notice of it, and have no cause to suspect any fraudulent disposition of the property, or have the positive assurances of the debtor, given shortly before the creation of the subsequent debts, that all his property was in his own name and should so remain during his life, and be subject to his debts.

        An existing creditor does not lose his right against a voluntary conveyance for an existing debt by taking notes for it and a subsequently created debt bearing date after the conveyance, for if it is fraudulent as to the existing debt, it is likewise fraudulent as to the subsequent debt.

        A voluntary conveyance will not be presumed fraudulent as to subsequent creditors, but fraud in fact must be established; and one who gives credit to the grantor of a duly registered voluntary conveyance six months after its registration cannot claim that he relied on the security of the property conveyed.

        Although subsequent creditors may impeach a voluntary conveyance by showing antecedent debts to afford reasonable evidence of fraudulent intent, the mere existence of debts at the time of such conveyance is insufficient for this purpose, if amply sufficient property was retained to meet the indebtedness.

        Where the complainant knew of a fraudulent conveyance by defendant Long to his codefendant True to defraud Long's creditors, and assisted Long in the transaction, the complainant was not entitled as judgment creditor of Long, to reach funds owing from True to Long under the transaction and to subject those funds to complainant's judgment against Long, especially where complainant's judgment was rendered subsequent to the conveyance, and was founded on notes of Long acquired after such fraudulent conveyance.

        If, upon the eve of an indebtedness about to be increased, and with a view thereto, and without the knowledge of the creditor, the debtor makes a voluntary conveyance of property, upon which he knows his contemplated creditor relies or has a right to rely, this is an actual fraud, producing the same results both upon existing and subsequent creditors; and such conveyance is not relieved from its fraudulent character from the fact that it has been registered, if the creditor has no actual notice, and the conveyance, without his negligence, operates as a surprise upon him.

        Although the maker may not have been indebted at the time of making the voluntary gift or conveyance, if it was made with any design of fraud or collusion, or injury to other persons in the future, it would be void; and it is likewise true that, if the conveyance is made intentionally to defraud existing creditors, it will, in general, be held void as to subsequent creditors.

        A creditor, without first obtaining a judgment, may maintain a bill in chancery to set aside the debtor's fraudulent conveyances of property of any description — real, personal, or mixed and legal or equitable — and obtain satisfaction of his debt out of the property so fraudulently conveyed.

        A conveyance to secure certain creditors, which secures, whether expressly or secretly, any benefit or advantage to the debtor making it, is fraudulent in law as against the other unsecured creditors. Darwin v. Handley, 11 Tenn. 502, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1832); Sommerville v. Horton, 12 Tenn. 540, 12 Tenn. 541, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1833).

       <p>
        Where a deed of trust undertakes to secure debts largely in excess of the value of the property conveyed, and covers up none of the debtor's other property, if he has any, but leaving that subject to his other debts, his other creditors have no right to complain because of the fact that some benefit or advantage is given to the grantor in the use of the property and in the delay of time in closing the trust.

        A stipulation in a deed of trust that the grantor shall be employed as salesman by the trustee, and that he shall be allowed compensation out of the trust fund, does not of itself vitiate the deed.

        A condition excluding suing creditors, or a provision for preferences in a deed of trust executed under a power of attorney not authorizing the same, is void, and is not a part of the deed; and, therefore, such a provision does not render the deed fraudulent.

       <p>
        A deed of trust conveying property insufficient in value to satisfy the debts, and stipulating that the fund shall be divided pro rata among the creditors, and that all creditors accepting such pro rata shall take in absolute acquittance of their debts, or otherwise receive nothing, and that, if the fund should be more than sufficient to pay the claims of creditors accepting the terms of the deed, the surplus shall be paid to the debtor, and not appropriated for the benefit of the other creditors, is fraudulent in law. Wilde v. Rawlings, 38 Tenn. 34, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (Tenn. Sep. 1858).

        The mortgages or deeds of trust of a hopelessly insolvent corporation conveying practically all of its property, for the purpose of winding up its affairs in such manner as to secure preferences to a creditor who was an officer and director, and ceasing to do business with no intention of resuming again, are fraudulent.

        A confession of judgment by a debtor is fraudulent as against his other creditors, where the debtor and creditor collude together, and, by fraudulent practices, resort to the confessed judgment, with the purpose of defeating the debtor's other creditors, as where a creditor by notes not due procures the debtor to make past due notes in lieu thereof, and to confess judgment thereon, and causes executions to be levied on land as that of the confessed judgment debtor, though previously conveyed by unregistered deed with a vendor's lien retained, all of which was known to such judgment creditor, and done for the purpose of defeating the lien debt held by the assignees of the judgment debtor.

        Where the facts and circumstances raise a suspicion of fraud which is equivalent to a presumption of fraud, it is incumbent upon the party, though a defendant, claiming under the conveyance, to remove such presumption and to show the good faith and fairness of the transaction, and the actual payment of the consideration.

        Where a bill is filed by a creditor attacking a conveyance as fraudulent against creditors, and the answer responsively denies the fraud, or the facts charged as constituting the fraud, without more, the burden rests upon the complainant to prove the fraud. Washington v. Ryan, 64 Tenn. 622, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (1875); Cox v. Scott, 68 Tenn. 305, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1878); Yost v. Hudiburg, 70 Tenn. 627, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 208 (1879); Williamson v.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is only where the answer expressly or impliedly admits material matter which tends to support the allegation of the bill that the burden shifts to the defendant, to make proof of explanatory matter set up in avoidance. Farmers Bank of Lynchburg v. Farrar, 4 Tenn. App. 186, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 180 (1926); City Nat'l Bank v. Barnes, 164 Tenn. 450, 51 S.W.2d 503, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1932).

        Where the bill anticipates the defense and such defense is made in answer, then as to such matter the burden is on the complainant. Farmers Bank of Lynchburg v. Farrar, 4 Tenn. App. 186, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 180 (1926); City Nat'l Bank v. Barnes, 164 Tenn. 450, 51 S.W.2d 503, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inference of fraud may be drawn from facts and circumstances admitted in answer, and the burden of proof put on defendant, though the answer explicitly denies the fraud. Hartnett v. Doyle, 16 Tenn. App. 302, 64 S.W.2d 227, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 6 (1932).

        Proof that a voluntary conveyance was made to defeat unjust demands against him is not sufficient proof that there were legal or just demands against him, and some existing debt must be proved to render the conveyance fraudulent as against existing or subsequent creditors. Greenlee v. Hays' Adm'r, 1 Tenn. 300, 1808 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1808).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law will not presume fraud; and while the law requires fraud to be proved by facts sworn to, or circumstances arising from and connected with the facts sworn; yet, in most instances, the evidence of it must be gathered more from the circumstances attending the transaction than upon tangible proof, as such things are not generally told or done openly. Fraud will, in most instances, though ever so artfully and secretly contrived, leave its slime by which it may be traced. Floyd v. Goodwin, 16 Tenn. 484, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1835); Harris v. Smith, 42 Tenn. 306, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 63 (1865); Kelton v. Millikin, 42 Tenn. 410, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1865); Parrott v. Parrott, 48 Tenn. 681, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 133 (1870); Nelson v.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary to prove, by direct and express evidence, the intent to defraud, for this would be impracticable in many instances. The intent may be collected from the circumstances of the case and such badges of fraud as the transaction wears. Nelson v. Vanden, 99 Tenn. 224, 42 S.W. 5, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1897).

        Where one sells personalty absolutely, or sells and conveys land absolutely, and retains the possession of the property inconsistently with the terms of the sale or the terms of the deed, his declarations made, even in the absence of the purchaser, in reference to the ownership, contract, the character of his possession, or the terms upon which he holds, may be received in evidence against the purchaser, as part of the res gestae. But where his possession is consistent with the terms of the sale or deed, such statements and declarations of his, made in the absence of the purchaser and without his knowledge, are not admissible as evidence as against the purchaser.

Where the purchaser of land fraudulently procures the title to be made to a third person to hinder and delay his creditors, the creditors of such third person may subject the same to the payment of their debts against him while the title remains in him, yet if, before any proceedings against him by his creditors, he reconveys the property to the true purchaser and owner, without fraudulent intent and while abundantly able to pay all of his debts, the land cannot be reached in satisfaction of debts by his creditors.

Porter v. Armstrong, 10 Tenn. 74, 1820 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1820); Hallum v. Yourie, 33 Tenn. 369, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1853); Gunn v. Mason, 34 Tenn. 637, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1855).

        This section does not apply where the loan of goods and chattels was made in another state, or where the limitation or reservation was made by deed or will in another state, in which the property was at the time situate, so as to require the registration of such instruments in this state. Crenshaw v. Anthony, 8 Tenn. 101, 8 Tenn. 102, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1827); Loving v. Hunter, 16 Tenn. 4, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1835); Gilliam v. Spence, 25 Tenn. 160, 1845 Tenn.

        The owner of the property loaned must be a party to the deed or will declaring the loan, and such a declaration by a stranger in interest will be invalid, and will not prevent the operation of this section. Wade v. Green, 22 Tenn. 547, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1842).

To give such borrower the title, his possession must be adverse to the deed or will for the requisite period from the date of the registration of the deed or probate of the will. Gilliam v.

        If, after five years, the lender regains possession of the property and holds it bona fide as his own for any length of time, and then again lends the property to the same person, the borrower must hold the possession, continuously and uninterruptedly, for another five years, before his subsequent creditors can subject the property to the satisfaction of their debts against him.

        Where a parent places personalty in the possession of his child, without any explanation as to the manner in which the latter is to hold it, the law will presume it to be a gift; but the presumption only holds in the absence of proof showing a contrary intention.

        The donee's possession of personalty under a verbal gift would, from the nature of the transaction, be for himself exclusively, and the statute of limitation contained in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-105" target="_blank">28-3-105</a></cite> would commence running; and if such possession be held by the donee for three years, and if the donor does not, by suit or otherwise, reclaim the property, the title, not, indeed, by operation of the gift and delivery, but by the adverse possession under the statute, would be vested in the donee as against the donor and others, for while the verbal gift, in such case, is invalid as conferring title, still it would serve to manifest and establish the nature and character of the donee's possession.

        A remainderman in personalty under a registered deed or probated will is not affected by the possession of the borrower for five years under a loan made by the life tenant; and in a proper case, the rights of the remaindermen will be protected in chancery.

        <p>
         The term “alien” implies the absolute divestiture of all title in the grantor and the vesting of it in the grantee, and also a surrender of the possession of the land conveyed. A conveyance by mortgage or deed of trust is not an alienation, and such conveyance to secure a preexisting debt does not constitute a bona fide alienation. The alienation must not only be bona fide, but it must be absolute to protect the grantee. Maydwell v. Maydwell, 56 Tenn. 571, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 177 (1872); Camp v. Sherley, 77 Tenn. 255, 1882 Tenn.

         Where the heir or devisee dies without alienating the land, his heir or devisee cannot, even before action brought or process sued out to subject the land to the payment of the ancestor's debts, alienate the same so as to defeat the claims of the creditors of the original ancestor. The statute applies only to the ancestor's own immediate heir or devisee, and not to the heir or devisee of the ancestor's heir or devisee. Maydwell v. Maydwell, 56 Tenn. 571, 1872 Tenn.

         The heir or devisee is so far the owner of the land that if, before any proceeding or suit is instituted to subject the same to sale for the payment of the ancestor's debts, he makes a bona fide conveyance of the land, the bona fide purchaser, paying for the same before notice of the indebtedness of the ancestor's estate, gets a good title.

          With the exception of arguing that all of the company's transfers were made to an insider, the insurance agency, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-302" target="_self">66-3-302</a></cite>, the plaintiff failed to show how each of the transfers triggered any of the factors that may be considered in determining actual intent under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a" target="_self">66-3-305(a)</a></cite>. However, even with the existence of at least one such factor, the evidence preponderated against a finding that the transfers were made with the actual intent to defraud the plaintiff; indeed, given the evidence offered at trial concerning the checks, it appeared more likely than not that the transfers were made by the company to the insurance agency for a whole host of business reasons, and thus, the transfers were not fraudulent under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a" target="_self">66-3-305(a)</a></cite>(1).

           The definition of “asset” is substantially to the same effect as the definition of “assets” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-301(1)]. The definition in this Act, unlike that in the earlier Act, does not, however require a determination that the property is liable for the debts of the debtor. Thus, an unliquidated claim for damages resulting from personal injury or a contingent claim of a surety for reimbursement, contribution, or subrogation may be counted as an asset for the purpose of determining whether the holder of the claim is solvent as a debtor under § 2 of this Act [T.C.A. § 66-3-303], although applicable law may not allow such an asset to be levied on and sold by a creditor. Cf.  Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co. v. Goldman (In re Ollag Construction Equipment Corp.), 578 F.2d 904, 907-09 (2d Cir. 1978).
           <p>
            Subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) provide clarification by excluding from the term not only generally exempt property but also an interest in a tenancy by the entirety in many states and an interest that is generally beyond reach by unsecured creditors because subject to a valid lien. This Act, like its predecessor and the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, declares rights and provides remedies for unsecured creditors against transfers that impede them in the collection of their claims. The laws protecting valid liens against impairment by levying creditors, exemption statutes, and the rules restricting levyability of interest in entireties property are limitations on the rights and remedies of unsecured creditors, and it is therefore appropriate to exclude property interests that are beyond the reach of unsecured creditors from the definition of “asset” for the purposes of this Act.
           </p>
           <p>
            A creditor of a joint tenant or tenant in common may ordinarily collect a judgment by process against the tenant's interest, and in some states a creditor of a tenant by the entirety may likewise collect a judgment by process against the tenant's interest. See 2 American Law of Property 10, 22, 28-32 (1952); Craig, An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy, 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258-59 (1974). The levyable interest of such a tenant is included as an asset under this Act.
           </p>
           <p>
            The definition of “assets” in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act excluded property that is exempt from liability for debts. The definition did not, however, exclude all property that cannot be reached by a creditor through judicial proceedings to collect a debt. Thus, it included the interest of a tenant by the entirety although in nearly half the states such an interest cannot be subjected to liability for a debt unless it is an obligation owed jointly by the debtor with his or her cotenant by the entirety. See 2 American Law of Property 29 (1952); Craig, An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy, 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258 (1974). The definition in this Act requires exclusion of interests in property held by tenants by the entirety that are not subject to collection process by a creditor without a right to proceed against both tenants by the entirety as joint debtors.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reference to “generally exempt” property in § 1(2)(ii) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-302ol12B" target="_self">66-3-302(2)(B)</a></cite>] recognizes that all exemptions are subject to exceptions. Creditors having special rights against generally exempt property typically include claimants for alimony, taxes, wages, the purchase price of the property, and labor or materials that improve the property. See Uniform Exemptions Act § 10 and the accompanying Comment. The fact that a particular creditor may reach generally exempt property by resorting to judicial process does not warrant its inclusion as an asset in determining whether the debtor is insolvent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since this Act is not an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations (see Comment (8) to § 4 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305" target="_self">66-3-305</a></cite>, Comment (8)] infra ), it does not preclude the holder of a claim that may be collected by process against property generally exempt as to other creditors from obtaining relief from a transfer of such property that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim. Likewise the holder of an unsecured claim enforceable against tenants by the entirety is not precluded by the Act from pursuing a remedy against a transfer of property held by the entirety that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nonbankruptcy law is the law of a state or federal law that is not part of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code. The definition of an “asset” thus does not include property that would be subject to administration for the benefit of creditors under the Bankruptcy Code unless it is subject under other applicable law, state or federal, to process for the collection of a creditor's claim against a single debtor.

           The definition of “claim” is derived from § 101(4) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(5)]. Since the purpose of this Act is primarily to protect unsecured creditors against transfers and obligations injurious to their rights, the words “claim” and “debt” as used in the Act generally have reference to an unsecured claim and debt. As the context may indicate, however, usage of the terms is not so restricted. See, e.g.  §§ 1(1)(i)(B) and 1(8) [T.C.A. § 66-3-302(1)(A)(ii) and (8)].

           The definition of “creditor” in combination with the definition of “claim” has substantially the same effect as the definition of “creditor” under § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-301(3)]. As under that Act, the holder of an unliquidated tort claim or a contingent claim may be a creditor protected by this Act.

           The definition of “insider” is derived from § 101(28) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(31)]. The definition has been restricted in clauses (i)(C), (ii)(E), and (iii)(D) [T.C.A. § 66-3-301(7)(a)(iii), (7)(B)(v), and (7)(C)(iv)] to make clear that a partner is not an insider of an individual, corporation, or partnership if any of these latter three persons is only a limited partner. The definition of “insider” in the Bankruptcy Code does not purport to make a limited partner an insider of the partners or of the partnership with which the limited partner is associated, but it is susceptible of a contrary interpretation and one which would extend unduly the scope of the defined relationship when the limited partner is not a person in control of the partnership. The definition of “insider” in this Act also differs from the definition in the Bankruptcy Code in omitting the reference in 11 U.S.C. § 101(28)(D) [11 U.S.C. § 101(31)(D)] to an elected official or relative of such an official as an insider of a municipality. As in the Bankruptcy Code (see 11 U.S.C. § 102(3)), the word “includes” is not limiting, however. Thus, a court may find a person living with an individual for an extended time in the same household or as a permanent companion to have the kind of close relationship intended to be covered by the term “insider.” Likewise, a trust may be found to be an insider of a beneficiary.

           The definition of “lien” is derived from paragraphs (30), (31), (43), and (45) of § 101 of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(36), (37), (51), and (53)], which define “judicial lien,” “lien,” “security interest,” and “statutory lien” respectively.

           The definition of “transfer” is derived principally from § 101(48) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(54)]. The definition of “conveyance” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-301(2)] was similarly comprehensive, and the references in this Act to “payment of money, release, lease, and the creation of a lien or incumbrance” are derived from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. While the definition in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act did not explicitly refer to an involuntary transfer, the decisions under that Act were generally consistent with an interpretation that covered such a transfer. See, e.g. , Hearn  45 St. Corp. v. Jano, 283 N.Y. 139, 27 N.E.2d 814, 128 A.L.R. 1285 (1940) (execution and foreclosure sales); Lefkowitz v.

           Subsection (a) is derived from the definition of “insolvent” in § 101(29)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(32)(A)]. The definition in subsection (a) and the correlated definition of partnership insolvency in subsection (c) contemplate a fair valuation of the debts as well as the assets of the debtor. As under the definition of the same term in § 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-302] exempt property is excluded from the computation of the value of the assets. See § 1(2) supra  [T.C.A. § 66-3-302(2)]. For similar reasons interests in valid spendthrift trusts and interests in tenancies by the entireties that cannot be severed by a creditor of only one tenant are not included. See the Comment to § 1(2) supra  [T.C.A. § 66-3-302, Comment (2)]. Since a valid lien also precludes an unsecured creditor from collecting the creditor's claim from the encumbered interest in a debtor's property, both the encumbered interest and the debt secured thereby are excluded from the computation of insolvency under this Act. See § 1(2) supra  [T.C.A. § 66-3-302(2)] and subsection (e) of this section.

Knowledge of the facts rendering the transfer voidable would be inconsistent with the good faith that is required of a protected transferee. Knowledge of the voidability of a transfer would seem to involve a legal conclusion. Determination of the voidability of the transfer ought not to require the court to inquire into the legal sophistication of the transferee.

           Section 2(b) [T.C.A. § 66-3-303(b)] establishes a rebuttable presumption of insolvency from the fact of general nonpayment of debts as they become due. Such general nonpayment is a ground for the filing of an involuntary petition under § 303(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 303(h)(1)]. See also U.C.C. § 1-201(23) [T.C.A. § 47-1-201], which declares a person to be “insolvent” who “has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business.” The presumption imposes on the party against whom the presumption is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of insolvency as defined in § 2(a) [T.C.A. § 66-3-303(a)] is more probable than its existence. See Uniform Rules of Evidence (1974 Act), Rule 301(a). The 1974 Uniform Rule 301(a) conforms to the Final Draft of Federal Rule 301 as submitted to the United States Supreme Court by the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Evidence. “The so-called ‘bursting bubble’ theory, under which a presumption vanishes upon the introduction of evidence which would support a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact, even though not believed, is rejected as according presumptions too ‘slight and evanescent’ an effect.” Advisory Committee's Note to Rule 301. See also 1 J.Weinstein & M.Berger, Evidence 301 [01] (1982).
           <p>
            The presumption is established in recognition of the difficulties typically imposed on a creditor in proving insolvency in the bankruptcy sense, as provided in subsection (a). See generally Levit, The Archaic Concept of Balance-Sheet Insolvency, 47 Am.Bankr.L.J. 215 (1973). Not only is the relevant information in the possession of a noncooperative debtor but the debtor's records are more often than not incomplete and inaccurate. As a practical matter, insolvency is most cogently evidenced by a general cessation of payment of debts, as has long been recognized by the laws of other countries and is now reflected in the Bankruptcy Code. See Honsberger, Failure to Pay One's Debts Generally as They Become Due: The Experience of France and Canada, 54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 153 (1980); J. MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 13, 63-64, 436 (1956). In determining whether a debtor is paying its debts generally as they become due, the court should look at more than the amount and due dates of the indebtedness. The court should also take into account such factors as the number of the debtor's debts, the proportion of those debts not being paid, the duration of the nonpayment, and the existence of bona fide disputes or other special circumstances alleged to constitute an explanation for the stoppage of payments. The court's determination may be affected by a consideration of the debtor's payment practices prior to the period of alleged nonpayment and the payment practices of the trade or industry in which the debtor is engaged. The case law that has developed under § 303(h)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code [<cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 303(h)</cite>(1)] has not required a showing that a debtor has failed or refused to pay a majority in number and amount of his or her debts in order to prove general nonpayment of debts as they become due. See, e.g. , Hill v. Cargill, Inc. (In re Hill), 8 B.R. 779, 3 C.B.C.2d 920 (Bk.D.Minn. 1981) (nonpayment of three largest debts held to constitute general nonpayment, although small debts were being paid); In re All Media Properties, Inc., 5 B.R. 126, 6 B.C.D. 586, 2 C.B.C.2d 449 (Bk.S.D.Tex. 1980) (missing significant number of payments or regularly missing payments significant in amount said to constitute general nonpayment; missing payments on more than 50% of aggregate of claims said not to be required to show general nonpayment; nonpayment for more than 30 days after billing held to establish nonpayment of a debt when it is due); In re Kreidler Import Corp., 4 B.R. 256, 6 B.C.D. 608, 2 C.B.C.2d 159 (Bk.D.Md. 1980) (nonpayment of one debt constituting 97% of debtor's total indebtedness held to constitute general nonpayment). A presumption of insolvency does not arise from nonpayment of a debt as to which there is a genuine bona fide dispute, even though the debt is a substantial part of the debtor's indebtedness. Cf. <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 303(h)</cite>(1), as amended by § 426(b) of Public Law No. 98-882, the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984.

           Subsection (c) is derived from the definition of partnership insolvency in § 101(29)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(32)(B)]. The definition conforms generally to the definition of the same term in § 2(2) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-303].

           Subsection (d) follows the approach of the definition of “insolvency” in § 101(29) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 101(32)] by excluding from the computation of the value of the debtor's assets any value that can be realized only by avoiding a transfer of an interest formerly held by the debtor or by discovery or pursuit of property that has been fraudulently concealed or removed.

          Where a bankruptcy debtor issued quit claim deeds to lenders in lieu of foreclosure to obtain an extension of the date of a foreclosure sale, and the deeds were retrieved from escrow and recorded after the debtor failed to satisfy the mortgage debts before expiration of the period of extension, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-304ol1b" target="_self">66-3-304(b)</a></cite> did not apply to establish that the lenders gave reasonably equivalent value for the deeds for purposes of fraudulent transfer, since recording of the deeds even when consensual, did not by itself effectuate a regularly conducted, non-collusive foreclosure sale.

           Section 3(a) [T.C.A. § 66-3-304] is adapted from § 548(d)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 548(d)(2)(A)]. See also § 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-304(1)]. The definition in Section 3 [T.C.A. § 66-3-304] is not exclusive. “Value” is to be determined in light of the purpose of the Act to protect a debtor's estate from being depleted to the prejudice of the debtor's unsecured creditors. Consideration having no utility from a creditor's viewpoint does not satisfy the statutory definition. The definition does not specify all the kinds of consideration that do not constitute value for the purposes of this Act — e.g., love and affection. See, e.g. , United States v. West, 299 F.Supp. 661, 666 (D.Del. 1969).

           Section 3(a) [T.C.A. § 66-3-304(b)] does not indicate what is “reasonably equivalent value” for a transfer or obligation. Under this Act, as under § 548(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(2)], a transfer for security is ordinarily for a reasonably equivalent value notwithstanding a discrepancy between the value of the asset transferred and the debt secured, since the amount of the debt is the measure of the value of the interest in the asset that is transferred. See, e.g. , Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Co. v. Holy Family Polish Nat'l Catholic Church, Carnegie, Pa., 341 Pa. 390, 19 A.2d 360 (1941). If, however, a transfer purports to secure more than the debt actually incurred or to be incurred, it may be found to be for less than a reasonably equivalent value. See e.g. , In re Peoria Braumeister Co., 138 F.2d 520, 523 (7th Cir. 1943) (chattel mortgage securing a $3,000 note held to be fraudulent when the debt secured was only $2,500); Hartford Acc. & Indemnity Co. v. Jirasek, 254 Mich. 131, 140, 235 N.W. 836, 839 (1931) (quitclaim deed given as mortgage held to be fraudulent to the extent the value of the property transferred exceeded the indebtedness secured). If the debt is a fraudulent obligation under this Act, a transfer to secure it as well as the obligation would be vulnerable to attack as fraudulent. A transfer to satisfy or secure an antecedent debt owed an insider is also subject to avoidance under the conditions specified in Section 5(b) [§ 66-3-306(b)].

           Section 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-304(1)] has been thought not to recognize that an unperformed promise could constitute fair consideration. See McLaughlin, Application of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, 46 Harv.L.Rev. 404, 414 (1933). Courts construing these provisions of the prior law nevertheless have held unperformed promises to constitute value in a variety of circumstances. See, e.g. , Harper v. Lloyd's Factors, Inc., 214 F.2d 662 (2d Cir. 1954) (transfer of money for promise of factor to discount transferor's purchase-money notes given to fur dealer); Schlecht v. Schlecht, 168 Minn. 168, 176-77, 209 N.W. 883, 886-87 (1926) (transfer for promise to make repairs and improvements on transferor's homestead); Farmer's Exchange Bank v. Oneida Motor Truck Co., 202 Wis. 266, 232 N.W. 536 (1930) (transfer in consideration of assumption of certain of transferor's liabilities); see also Hummel v. Cernocky, 161 F.2d 685 (7th Cir. 1947) (transfer in consideration of cash, assumption of a mortgage, payment of certain debts, and agreement to pay other debts). Likewise a transfer in consideration of a negotiable note discountable at a commercial bank, or the purchase from an established, solvent institution of an insurance policy, annuity, or contract to provide care and accommodations clearly appears to be for value. On the other hand, a transfer for an unperformed promise by an individual to support a parent or other transferor has generally been held voidable as a fraud on creditors of the transferor. See, e.g.,  Springfield Ins. Co. v. Fry, 267 F.Supp. 693 (N.D.Okla. 1967); Sandler v. Parlapiano, 236 App.Div. 70, 258 N.Y.Supp. 88 (1st Dep't 1932); Warwick Municipal Employees Credit Union v. Higham, 106 R.E. 363, 259 A.2d 852 (1969); Hulsether v. Sanders, 54 S.D. 412, 223 N.W. 335 (1929); Cooper v. Cooper, 22 Tenn.App. 473, 477, 124 S.W.2d 264, 267 (1939); Note, Rights of Creditors in Property Conveyed in Consideration of Future Support, 45 Iowa L.Rev. 546, 550-62 (1960). This Act adopts the view taken in the cases cited in determining whether an unperformed promise is value.

           Subsection (b) rejects the rule of such cases as Durrett v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 621 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1980) (nonjudicial foreclosure of a mortgage avoided as a fraudulent transfer when the property of an insolvent mortgagor was sold for less than 70% of its fair value); and Abramson v. Lakewood Bank & Trust Co., 647 F.2d 547 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1164 (1982) (nonjudicial foreclosure held to be fraudulent transfer if made without fair consideration). Subsection (b) adopts the view taken in Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Madrid (In re Madrid), 21 B.R. 424 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1982), aff'd on other grounds, 725 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir. 1984), that the price bid at a public foreclosure sale determines the fair value of the property sold. Subsection (b) prescribes the effect of a sale meeting its requirements, whether the asset sold is personal or real property. The rule of this subsection applies to a foreclosure by sale of the interest of a vendee under an installment land contract in accordance with applicable law that requires or permits the foreclosure to be effected by a sale in the same manner as the foreclosure of a mortgage. See G.Osborne, G.Nelson, & D.Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law  83-84, 95-97 (1979). The premise of the subsection is that “a sale of the collateral by the secured party as the normal consequence of default … [is] the safest way of establishing the fair value of the collateral.…” 2 G.Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property, 1227 (1965).

          Even if the court were to assume that the  insurance agency's stock transfer was made by the owner with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the plaintiff, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a1" target="_self">66-3-305(a)(1)</a></cite>, the fact remained that the owner was no longer a defendant in the lawsuit. As to the actual defendant, the insurance agency, the owner's son's status as an insurance agency employee could not, by itself, automatically make the insurance agency a conspirator in a scheme to defraud the plaintiff, and the plaintiff failed to show that the owner's son acted on behalf of the agency when he participated in discussions concerning the underlying transaction. Nippert v. Jackson, 860 F. Supp. 2d 554, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35109 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 15, 2012).

          Beginning in 2005, the owner caused the company to write checks to another entity he controlled that totaled $53,632, and without offering many details, the plaintiff claimed that each of those funds transfers was made in furtherance of a conspiracy between the company, the insurance agency, and the other entity to defraud him. Because the evidence in the record did not establish that any of those transfers was fraudulent, the plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim as to those transfers failed; with the exception of arguing that all of the transfers were made to an insider, the plaintiff failed to show how each of those transfers implicated any of the other factors considered in determining actual intent under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, and there was ample evidence establishing that each of the checks constituted repayments of a loan. Nippert v. Jackson, 860 F. Supp. 2d 554, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35109 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 15, 2012).

          With the exception of arguing that all of the company's transfers were made to an insider, the insurance agency, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-302" target="_self">66-3-302</a></cite>, the plaintiff failed to show how each of the transfers triggered any of the factors that may be considered in determining actual intent under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a" target="_self">66-3-305(a)</a></cite>. However, even with the existence of at least one such factor, the evidence preponderated against a finding that the transfers were made with the actual intent to defraud the plaintiff; indeed, given the evidence offered at trial concerning the checks, it appeared more likely than not that the transfers were made by the company to the insurance agency for a whole host of business reasons, and thus, the transfers were not fraudulent under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a" target="_self">66-3-305(a)</a></cite>(1).

          Business proved the transfer of the company was to the owner's son, and before the transfer, the owner had been sued or threatened with suit, but the son testified that the owner was 69 years old and not in good health, the parties went to an attorney for advice on the transfer, and the statement of evidence did not show that the business presented any contrary evidence, and thus the business failed to prove that the owner transferred the company to his son with the actual intent to defraud the business.

          Doctor, who sought to recover judgment against corporation, alleged that the owner of the corporation was involved in a fraudulent transfer and that he was entitled to judgment against the owner; the owner took $100,000 from the corporation's accounts receivable and deposited it into his personal bank account and he completely liquidated the remaining assets of the corporation during the litigation. The trial court did not err in finding that the owner's actions were not done in good faith; therefore, the trial court properly found that the corporation made a fraudulent conveyance to the owner and it properly assessed the judgment against the owner, personally.

          Debtor could amend answer to add cross-claim for fraudulent transfer because it did not unduly delay, transferee did not allege lack of notice, there was no bad faith, filing of bankruptcy and additional fiduciary responsibilities imposed on debtor were significant changes in circumstances that counterbalanced transferee's argument that too much time had passed, there should not be significant additional burden placed on transferee to prepare defense, allowing amendment was not futile given prospect that debtor was not barred by four year statute of limitations and could step into creditor's shoes to pursue fraudulent transfer, and allowing amendment was in best interests of justice given debtor's fiduciary obligations to creditors.

           Section 4(a)(1) [T.C.A. § 66-3-305(a)(1)] is derived from § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-308]. Factors appropriate for consideration in determining actual intent under paragraph (1) [T.C.A. § 66-3-305(A)(1)] are specified in subsection (b).

           Section 4(a)(2) [T.C.A. § 66-3-305(a)(2)] is derived from §§ 5 and 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former §§ 66-3-305 — 66-3-307] but substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.” The transferee's good faith was an element of “fair consideration” as defined in § 3 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-304], and lack of fair consideration was one of the elements of a fraudulent transfer as defined in four sections of the Uniform Act [former §§ 66-3-305 through 66-3-308]. The transferee's good faith is irrelevant to a determination of the adequacy of the consideration under this Act, but lack of good faith may be a basis for withholding protection of a transferee or obligee under § 8 infra  [T.C.A. § 66-3-309].

           Unlike the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act as originally promulgated, this Act does not prescribe different tests when a transfer is made for the purpose of security and when it is intended to be absolute. The premise of this Act is that when a transfer is for security only, the equity or value of the asset that exceeds the amount of the debt secured remains available to unsecured creditors and thus cannot be regarded as the subject of a fraudulent transfer merely because of the encumbrance resulting from an otherwise valid security transfer. Disproportion between the value of the asset securing the debt and the size of the debt secured does not, in the absence of circumstances indicating a purpose to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, constitute an impermissible hindrance to the enforcement of other creditors' rights against the debtor-transferor. Cf . U.C.C. § 9-311 [T.C.A. § 47-9-311].

           Subparagraph (i) of § 4(a)(2) [T.C.A. § 66-3-305(a)(2))(A)] is an adaptation of § 5 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-306] but substitutes “unreasonably small [assets] in relation to the business or transaction” for “unreasonably small capital.” The reference to “capital” in the Uniform Act is ambiguous in that it may refer to net worth or to the par value of stock or to the consideration received for stock issued. The special meanings of “capital” in corporation law have no relevance in the law of fraudulent transfers. The subparagraph focuses attention on whether the amount of all the assets retained by the debtor was inadequate, i.e. , unreasonably small, in light of the needs of the business or transaction in which the debtor was engaged or about to engage.

           Subsection (b) is a nonexclusive catalogue of factors appropriate for consideration by the court in determining whether the debtor had an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud one or more creditors. Proof of the existence of any one or more of the factors enumerated in subsection (b) may be relevant evidence as to the debtor's actual intent but does not create a presumption that the debtor has made a fraudulent transfer or incurred a fraudulent obligation. The list of factors includes most of the badges of fraud that have been recognized by the courts in construing and applying the Statute of 13 Elizabeth and § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-308]. Proof of the presence of certain badges in combination establishes fraud conclusively — i.e. , without regard to the actual intent of the parties — when they concur as provided in § 4(a)(2) or in § 5 [T.C.A. § 66-3-305(a)(2) or § 66-3-306]. The fact that a transfer has been made to a relative or to an affiliated corporation has not been regarded as a badge of fraud sufficient to warrant avoidance when unaccompanied by any other evidence of fraud. The courts have uniformly recognized, however, that a transfer to a closely related person warrants close scrutiny of the other circumstances, including the nature and extent of the consideration exchanged. See 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences § 307 (Rev. ed. 1940). The second, third, fourth, and fifth factors listed are all adapted from the classic catalogue of badges of fraud provided by Lord Coke in Twyne's Case, 3 Coke 80b, 76 Eng.Rep. 809 (Star Chamber 1601). Lord Coke also included the use of a trust and the recitation in the instrument of transfer that it “was made honestly, truly, and bona fide,” but the use of the trust is fraudulent only when accompanied by elements or badges specified in this Act, and recitals of “good faith” can no longer be regarded as significant evidence of a fraudulent intent.

          The effect of the two transfers described in § 4(b)(11) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1b11" target="_self">66-3-305(b)(11)</a></cite>], if not avoided, may be to permit a debtor and a lienor to deprive the debtor's unsecured creditors of access to the debtor's assets for the purpose of collecting their claims while the debtor, the debtor's affiliate or insider, and the lienor arrange for the beneficial use or disposition of the assets in accordance with their interests. The kind of disposition sought to be reached here is exemplified by that found in Northern Pacific Co. v. Boyd, <cite class="us_code">228 U.S. 482</cite> (1913), the leading case in establishing the absolute priority doctrine in reorganization law. There the Court held that a reorganization whereby the secured creditors and the management-owners retained their economic interests in a railroad through a foreclosure that cut off claims of unsecured creditors against its assets was in effect a fraudulent disposition (id. at 502-05). See Frank, Some Realistic Reflections on Some Aspects of Corporate Reorganization, 19 Va. L.Rev. 541, 693 (1933). For cases in which an analogous injury to unsecured creditors was inflicted by a lienor and a debtor, see Jackson v. Star Sprinkler Corp. of Florida, 575 F.2d 1223, 1231-34 (8th Cir. 1978); Heath v. Helmick, 173 F.2d 157, 161-62 (9th Cir. 1949); Toner v. Nuss, 234 F.S. 457, 461-62 (E.D.Pa. 1964); and see In re Spotless Tavern Co., Inc., 4 F.Supp. 752, 753, 755 (D.Md. 1933).

          Nothing in § 4(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1b" target="_self">66-3-305(b)</a></cite>] is intended to affect the application of § 2-402(2), 9-205, 9-301, or 6-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code [T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c02s47-2-402ol12" target="_blank">47-2-402(2)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c09s47-9-205" target="_blank">47-9-205</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c09s47-9-301" target="_blank">47-9-301</a></cite>, or former § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c06s47-6-105" target="_blank">47-6-105</a></cite>]. Section 2-402(2) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c02s47-2-402ol12" target="_blank">47-2-402(2)</a></cite>] recognizes the generally prevailing rule that retention of possession of goods by a seller may be fraudulent but limits the application of the rule by negating any imputation of fraud from “retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification.” Section 9-205 [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c09s47-9-205" target="_blank">47-9-205</a></cite>] explicitly negates any imputation of fraud from the grant of liberty by a secured creditor to a debtor to use, commingle, or dispose of personal property collateral or to account for its proceeds. The section recognizes that it does not relax prevailing requirements for delivery of possession by a pledgor. Moreover, the section does not mitigate the general requirement of § 9-301(1)(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c09s47-9-301" target="_blank">47-9-301</a></cite>] that a nonpossessory security interest in personal property must be accompanied by notice-filing to be effective against a levying creditor. Finally, like the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act this Act does not pre-empt the statutes governing bulk transfers, such as Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code [former §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c06s47-6-101" target="_blank">47-6-101</a></cite> et seq.]. Compliance with the cited sections of the Uniform Commercial Code does not, however, insulate a transfer or obligation from avoidance. Thus a sale by an insolvent debtor for less than a reasonably equivalent value would be voidable under this Act notwithstanding compliance with the Uniform Commercial Code.

        <p>
         A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.

         A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the debtor was insolvent at that time, and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.

          Where a Chapter 7 debtor transferred real property to her husband and herself as tenants by the entirety, claiming that she transferred the property, because she thought he would be less worried about obtaining a large loan for her benefit if he had an ownership interest in the real property securing the debt, neither the trustee nor the husband were entitled to summary judgment in the trustee's fraudulent transfer claim under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a2" target="_self">66-3-305(a)(2)</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-306" target="_self">66-3-306</a></cite>, because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the value provided by the husband was reasonably equivalent to the value of the property transferred to him, and whether the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer.

          Transfer of debtor's property by quit claim deeds securing a debt was not avoidable under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 544(b)</cite> because the transfer was not constructively fraudulent under either T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305" target="_self">66-3-305</a></cite> or § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-306ol1a" target="_self">66-3-306(a)</a></cite>.

Yet, a civil conspiracy required that the alleged conspirators possessed the specific intent to commit an unlawful act or a lawful act by unlawful means, and since constructive fraud required no intent to deceive, a violation of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-306" target="_self">66-3-306</a></cite> could not form the underlying basis for the plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim.

          Debtor could amend answer to add cross-claim for fraudulent transfer because it did not unduly delay, transferee did not allege lack of notice, there was no bad faith, filing of bankruptcy and additional fiduciary responsibilities imposed on debtor were significant changes in circumstances that counterbalanced transferee's argument that too much time had passed, there should not be significant additional burden placed on transferee to prepare defense, allowing amendment was not futile given prospect that debtor was not barred by four year statute of limitations and could step into creditor's shoes to pursue fraudulent transfer, and allowing amendment was in best interests of justice given debtor's fiduciary obligations to creditors.

           Subsection (a) is derived from § 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-305]. It adheres to the limitation of the protection of that section to a creditor who extended credit before the transfer or obligation described. As pointed out in Comment (2) accompanying § 4 [§ 66-3-305, Comment (2)], this Act substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.”

           Subsection (b) renders a preferential transfer — i.e. , a transfer by an insolvent debtor for or on account of an antecedent debt — to an insider vulnerable as a fraudulent transfer when the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent. This subsection adopts for general application the rule of such cases as Jackson Sound Studios, Inc. v. Travis, 473 F.2d 503 (5th Cir. 1973) (security transfer of corporation's equipment to corporate principal's mother perfected on eve of bankruptcy of corporation held to be fraudulent); In re Lamie Chemical Co., 296 F. 24 (4th Cir. 1924) (corporate preference to corporate officers and directors held voidable by receiver when corporation was insolvent or nearly so and directors had already voted for liquidation); Stuart v. Larson, 298 F. 223 (8th Cir. 1924), noted 38 Harv.L.Rev. 521 (1925) (corporate preference to director held voidable). See generally 2 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences 386 (rev. ed. 1940). Subsection (b) overrules such cases as Epstein v. Goldstein, 107 F.2d 755, 757 (2d Cir. 1939) (transfer by insolvent husband to wife to secure his debt to her sustained against attack by husband's trustee); Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Jirasek, 254 Mich. 131, 139, 235 N.W. 836, 389 (1931) (mortgage given by debtor to his brother to secure an antecedent debt owed the brother sustained as not fraudulent).

           Subsection (b) does not extend as far as § 8(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-309] and § 548(b) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 548(b)] in rendering voidable a transfer or obligation incurred by an insolvent partnership to a partner, who is an insider of the partnership. The transfer to the partner is not vulnerable to avoidance under § 4(b) [§ 66-3-305(b)] unless the transfer was for an antecedent debt and the partner had reasonable cause to believe that the partnership was insolvent. The cited provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Bankruptcy Act make any transfer by an insolvent partnership to a partner voidable. Avoidance of the partnership transfer without reference to the partner's state of mind and the nature of the consideration exchanged would be unduly harsh treatment of the creditors of the partner and unduly favorable to the creditors of the partnership.

           One of the uncertainties in the law governing the avoidance of fraudulent transfers and obligations is the difficulty of determining when the cause of action arises. Subsection (b) clarifies this point in time. For transfers of real estate Section 6(1) [T.C.A. § 66-3-307(1)] fixes the time as the date of perfection against a good faith purchaser from the transferor and for transfers of fixtures and assets constituting personalty, the time is fixed as the date of perfection against a judicial lien creditor not asserting rights under this Act. Perfection typically is effected by notice-filing, recordation, or delivery of unequivocal possession. See U.C.C. §§ 9-302, 9-304, and 9-305 [T.C.A. §§ 47-9-302, 47-9-304, and 47-9-305] (security interest in personal property perfected by notice-filing or delivery of possession to transferee); 4 American Law of Property § 17.10-17.12 (1952) (recordation of transfer or delivery of possession to grantee required for perfection against bona fide purchaser from grantor). The provision for postponing the time a transfer is made until its perfection is an adaptation of § 548(d)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 548(d)(1)]. When no steps are taken to perfect a transfer that applicable law permits to be perfected, the transfer is deemed by paragraph (2) to be perfected immediately before the filing of an action to avoid it; without such a provision to cover that eventuality, an unperfected transfer would arguably be immune to attack. Some transfers — e.g., an assignment of a bank account, creation of a security interest in money, or execution of a marital or premarital agreement for the disposition of property owned by the parties to the agreement — may not be amenable to perfection as against a bona fide purchaser or judicial lien creditor. When a transfer is not perfectible as provided in paragraph (11), the transfer occurs for the purpose of this Act when the transferor effectively parts with an interest in the asset as provided in § 1(12) supra [§ 66-3-302(12)].

           Paragraph (4) requires the transferor to have rights in the asset transferred before the transfer is made for the purpose of this section. This provision makes clear that its purpose may not be circumvented by notice-filing or recordation of a document evidencing an interest in an asset to be acquired in the future. Cf . Bankruptcy Code § 547(e) [11 U.S.C. § 547(e)]; U.C.C. § 9-203(1)(c) [T.C.A. § 47-9-203].

           Paragraph (5) is new. It is intended to resolve uncertainty arising from Rubin v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, 661 F.2d 979, 989-91, 997 (2d Cir. 1981), insofar as that case holds that an obligation of guaranty may be deemed to be incurred when advances covered by the guaranty are made rather than when the guaranty first became effective between the parties. Compare Rosenberg, Intercorporate Guaranties and the Law of Fraudulent Conveyances: Lender Beware, 125 U.Pa.L.Rev. 235, 256-57 (1976).
           <p>
            An obligation may be avoided as fraudulent under this Act if it is incurred under the circumstances specified in § 4(a) or § 5(a) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-305ol1a" target="_self">66-3-305(a)</a></cite> or T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-306ol1a" target="_self">66-3-306(a)</a></cite>]. The debtor may receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for an obligation incurred even though the benefit to the debtor is indirect. See Rubin v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 661 F.2d at 991-92; Williams v. Twin City Co., 251 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir. 1958); Rosenberg, supra at 243-46.

           This section is derived from §§ 9 and 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former §§ 66-3-310 and 66-3-312]. Section 9 of that Act specified the remedies of creditors whose claims have matured, and § 10 enumerated the remedies available to creditors whose claims have not matured. A creditor holding an unmatured claim may be denied the right to receive payment for the proceeds of a sale on execution until his claim has matured, but the proceeds may be deposited in court or in an interest-bearing account pending the maturity of the creditor's claim. The remedies specified in this section are not exclusive.

          <li id="t66c03s66-3-308-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol12">
           The availability of an attachment or other provisional remedy has been restricted by amendments of statutes and rules of procedure to reflect views of the Supreme Court expressed in Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337 (1969), and its progeny. This judicial development and the procedural changes that followed in its wake do not preclude resort to attachment by a creditor in seeking avoidance of a fraudulent transfer or obligation. See, e.g. , Britton v. Howard Sav. Bank, 727 F.2d 315, 317-20 (3d Cir. 1984); Computer Sciences Corp. v. Sci-Tek Inc., 367 A.2d 658, 661 (Del. Super. 1976); Great Lakes Carbon Corp. v. Fontana, 54 A.D.2d 548, 387 N.Y.S. 2d 115 (1st Dep't 1976). Section 7(a)(2) [T.C.A. § 66-3-308(a)(2)] continues the authorization for the use of attachment contained in § 9(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-310(2)], or of a similar provisional remedy, when the state's procedure provides therefor, subject to the constraints imposed by the due process clauses of the United States and state constitutions.

           Subsections (a) and (b) of § 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-312] authorized the court, in an action on a fraudulent transfer or obligation, to restrain the defendant from disposing of his property, to appoint a receiver to take charge of his property, or to make any order the circumstances may require. Section 10, however, applied only to a creditor whose claim was unmatured. There is no reason to restrict the availability of these remedies to such a creditor, and the courts have not so restricted them. See, e.g. , Lipskey v. Voloshen, 155 Md. 139, 143-45, 141 Atl. 402, 404-05 (1928) (judgment creditor granted injunction against disposition of property by transferee, but appointment of receiver denied for lack of sufficient showing of need for such relief); Matthews v.

Moore, 155 Tenn. 359, 362-63, 293 S.W. 541, 542 (1927) (tort creditor granted injunction restraining alleged tortfeasor's disposition of property).

          Where one buys land in good faith, but does not pay a fair consideration, the conveyance may be treated as a fraud in law and the conveyance may be set aside, the property sold, and out of the proceeds the vendee may be repaid what he had paid in good faith for the land, and the balance applied on the debts of the creditors. But this rule does not apply where the purchaser paid in good faith and without notice a fair consideration for the property. First Nat'l Bank v. Wilkins, 11 Tenn. App. 9, 1929 Tenn.

           Subsection (a) states the rule that applies when the transferee establishes a complete defense to the action for avoidance based on Section 4(a)(1) [T.C.A. § 66-3-305(a)(1)]. The subsection is an adaptation of the exception stated in § 9 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § 66-3-310]. The person who invokes this defense carries the burden of establishing good faith and the reasonable equivalence of the consideration exchanged. Chorost v. Grand Rapids Factory Showrooms, Inc., 77 F. Supp. 276, 280 (D.N.J. 1948), aff'd, 172 F.2d 327, 329 (3d Cir. 1949).

           Subsection (b) is derived from § 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 550(a)]. The value of the asset transferred is limited to the value of the levyable interest on the transferor, exclusive of any interest encumbered by a valid lien. See § 1(2) supra  [T.C.A. § 66-3-302(2)].
          </li>
          <li id="t66c03s66-3-309-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol13">
           Subsection (c) is new. The measure of the recovery of a defrauded creditor against a fraudulent transferee is usually limited to the value of the asset transferred at the time of the transfer. See, e.g. , United States v. Fernon, 640 F.2d 609, 611 (5th Cir. 1981); Hamilton Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Halstead, 134 N.Y. 520, 31 N.E. 900 (1892); cf.  Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., 289 U.S. 227 (1932) (transferee's objection to trial court's award of highest value of asset between the date of the transfer and the date of the decree of avoidance rejected because an award measured by value as of time of the transfer plus interest from that date would have been larger). The premise of § 8(c) [T.C.A. § 66-3-309(c)] is that changes in value of the asset transferred that occur after the transfer should ordinarily not affect the amount of the creditor's recovery. Circumstances may require a departure from that measure of the recovery, however, as the cases decided under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and other laws derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth illustrate. Thus, if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce the judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by improvements of the asset transferred or discharge of liens on the property, a good faith transferee should be reimbursed for the outlay for such a purpose to the extent the sale proceeds were increased thereby. See Bankruptcy Code § 550(d) [11 U.S.C. § 550(e)]; Janson v. Schier, 375 A.2d 1159, 1160 (N.H. 1977); Anno., 8 A.L.R. 527 (1920). If the value of the asset has been diminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or fixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the resulting reduction. See Damazo v. Wahby, 269 Md. 252, 257, 305 A.2d 138, 142 (1973). If the transferee has collected rents, harvested crops, or derived other income from the use or occupancy of the asset after the transfer, the liability of the transferee should be limited in any event to the net income after deduction of the expense incurred in earning the income. Anno., 60 A.L.R.2d 593 (1958). On the other hand, adjustment for the equities does not warrant an award to the creditor of consequential damages alleged to accrue from mismanagement of the asset after the transfer.

           Subsection (d) is an adaptation of § 548(c) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 548(c)]. An insider who receives property or an obligation from an insolvent debtor as security for or in satisfaction of an antecedent debt of the transferor or obligor is not a good faith transferee or obligee if the insider has reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred.

          <li id="t66c03s66-3-309-COMMENTSTOOFFICIALTEXTol15">
           Subsection (e)(1) rejects the rule adopted in Darby v. Atkinson (In re Farris), 415 F.Supp. 33, 39-41 (W.D.Okla. 1976), that termination of a lease on default in accordance with its terms and applicable law may constitute a fraudulent transfer. Subsection (e)(2) protects a transferee who acquires a debtor's interest in an asset as a result of the enforcement of a secured creditor's rights pursuant to and in compliance with the provisions of Part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Cf.  Calaiaro v. Pittsburgh Nat'l Bank (In re Ewing), 33 B.R. 288, 9 C.B.C.2d 526, CCH B.L.R. 69,460 (Bk.W.D.Pa. 1983) (sale of pledged stock held subject to avoidance as fraudulent transfer in § 548 of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. § 548]), rev'd , 36 B.R. 476 (W.D.Pa. 1984) (transfer held not voidable because deemed to have occurred more than one year before bankruptcy petition filed). Although a secured creditor may enforce rights in collateral without a sale under § 9-502 or § 9-505 of the Code, the creditor must proceed in good faith (U.C.C. § 9-103 [T.C.A. § 47-9-102(43)]) and in a “commercially reasonable” manner. The “commercially reasonable” constraint is explicit in U.C.C. § 9-502(2) and is implicit in § 9-505. See 2 G. Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property 1224-27 (1965).

           Subsection (f) provides additional defenses against the avoidance of a preferential transfer to an insider under § 5(b) [T.C.A. § 66-3-306(b)].
           <p>
            Paragraph (1)  [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-309ol1f1" target="_self">66-3-309(f)(1)</a></cite>] is adapted from § 547(c)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code [<cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 547(c)</cite>(4)], which permits a preferred creditor to set off the amount of new value subsequently advanced against the recovery of a voidable preference by a trustee in bankruptcy to the debtor without security. The new value may consist not only of money, goods, or services delivered on unsecured credit but also of the release of a valid lien. See, e.g. , In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co., 424 F.2d 722, 724 (2d Cir. 1970); Baranow v. Gibraltor Factors Corp. (In re Hygrade Envelope Co.), 393 F.2d 60, 65-67 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">393 U.S. 837</cite> (1968); In re John Morrow &amp; Co., 134 F.686, 688 (S.D.Ohio 1901). It does not include an obligation substituted for a prior obligation. If the insider receiving the preference thereafter extends new credit to the debtor but also takes security from the debtor, the injury to the other creditors resulting from the preference remains undiminished by the new credit. On the other hand, if a lien taken to secure the new credit is itself voidable by a judicial lien creditor of the debtor, the new value received by the debtor may appropriately be treated as unsecured and applied to reduce the liability of the insider for the preferential transfer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paragraph (2)  [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-309ol1f2" target="_self">66-3-309(f)(2)</a></cite>] is derived from § 546(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code [<cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 547(c)</cite>(2)], which excepts certain payments made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs from avoidance by the trustee in bankruptcy as preferential transfers. Whether a transfer was in the “ordinary course” requires a consideration of the pattern of payments or secured transactions engaged in by the debtor and the insider prior to the transfer challenged under § 5(b) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-306ol1b" target="_self">66-3-306(b)</a></cite>]. See Tait &amp; Williams, Bankruptcy Preference Laws: The Scope of Section 547(c)(2), 99 Banking L.J. 55, 63-66 (1982). The defense provided by paragraph (2) [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-309ol1f2" target="_self">66-3-309(f)(2)</a></cite>] is available, irrespective of whether the debtor or the insider or both are engaged in business, but the prior conduct or practice of both the debtor and the insider-transferee is relevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paragraph (3)  [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-309ol1f3" target="_self">66-3-309(f)(3)</a></cite>] is new and reflects a policy judgment that an insider who has previously extended credit to a debtor should not be deterred from extending further credit to the debtor in a good faith effort to save the debtor from a forced liquidation in bankruptcy or otherwise. A similar rationale has sustained the taking of security from an insolvent debtor for an advance to enable the debtor to stave off bankruptcy and extricate itself from financial stringency. Blackman v. Bechtel, 80 F.2d 505, 508-09 (8th Cir. 1935); Olive v. Tyler (In re Chelan Land Co.), 257 F.497, <cite class="alr">5 A.L.R. 561</cite> (9th Cir. 1919); In re Robin Bros. Bakeries, Inc., 22 F.S. 662, 663-64 (N.D.Ill. 1937); see Dean v. Davis, <cite class="us_code">242 U.S. 438</cite>, 444 (1917). The amount of the present value given, the size of the antecedent debt secured, and the likelihood of success for the rehabilitative effort are relevant considerations in determining whether the transfer was in good faith.

          Debtor could amend answer to add cross-claim for fraudulent transfer because it did not unduly delay, transferee did not allege lack of notice, there was no bad faith, filing of bankruptcy and additional fiduciary responsibilities imposed on debtor were significant changes in circumstances that counterbalanced transferee's argument that too much time had passed, there should not be significant additional burden placed on transferee to prepare defense, allowing amendment was not futile given prospect that debtor was not barred by four year statute of limitations and could step into creditor's shoes to pursue fraudulent transfer, and allowing amendment was in best interests of justice given debtor's fiduciary obligations to creditors.

Co., 565 F.S. 556, 583 (M.D.Pa. 1983) (state statute of limitations held not to apply to action by United States based on Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act).

           Statutes of limitations applicable to the avoidance of fraudulent transfers and obligations vary widely from state to state and are frequently subject to uncertainties in their application. See Hesson, The Statute of Limitations in Actions to Set Aside Fraudulent Conveyances and in Actions Against Directors by Creditors of Corporations, 32 Cornell L.Q. 222 (1946); Annos., 76 A.L.R. 864 (1932), 128 A.L.R. 1289 (1940), 133 A.L.R. 1311 (1941), 14 A.L.R.2d 598 (1950), and 100 A.L.R.2d 1094 (1965). Together with § 6 [T.C.A. § 66-3-307], this section should mitigate the uncertainty and diversity that have characterized the decisions applying statutes of limitations to actions to fraudulent transfers and obligations. The periods prescribed apply, whether the action under this Act is brought by the creditor defrauded or by a purchaser at a sale on execution levied pursuant to § 7(b) [T.C.A. § 66-3-308(b)] and whether the action is brought against the original transferee or subsequent transferee. The prescription of statutory periods of limitation does not preclude the barring of an avoidance action for laches. See § 10 [T.C.A. § 66-3-311 and Comment] and the accompanying Comment infra .

          This section is derived from § 11 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act [former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c03s66-3-313" target="_self">66-3-313</a></cite>] and § 1-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code [T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c01s47-1-103" target="_blank">47-1-103</a></cite>]. The section adds a reference to “laches” in recognition of the particular appropriateness of the application of this equitable doctrine to an untimely action to avoid a fraudulent transfer. See Louis Dreyfus Corp. v. Butler, 496 F.2d 806, 808 (6th Cir. 1974) (action to avoid transfers to debtor's wife when debtor was engaged in speculative business held to be barred by laches or applicable statutes of limitations); Cooch v. Grier, 30 Del.Ch. 255, 265-66, 59 A.2d 282, 287-88 (1948) (action under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act held barred by laches when the creditor was chargeable with inexcusable delay and the defendant was prejudiced by the delay).

        The personal representative is the mere statutory conduit through whom the title of the heirs may pass. Hale v. Darter, 24 Tenn. 79, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1844).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute confers on the personal representative a mere naked power. It constitutes him a mere agent or attorney to execute a conveyance in the case provided for. Bartlett v. Watson, 35 Tenn. 287, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        A personal representative is not authorized to execute a deed where a deed was made to the decedent and another as individuals, and not in trust, in pursuance of a collateral agreement in writing between eleven persons, including among them the grantees, whereby land purchased by the eleven partners was to be conveyed to the grantees in trust for the use and benefit of all the partners, although the partnership was subsequently merged into a chartered corporation, and the deed was made by the personal representative of the decedent to the corporation, especially where there was nothing to show that the members of the partnership ever transferred their rights in the land to the corporation or that they ever demanded the execution of the deed to it. Byrd v. Phillips, 120 Tenn. 14, 111 S.W. 1109, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1907).

       </h4>
       <p>
        The existence of the obligation, or title bond, is indispensable to the exercise of the power, and to the validity of the deed. Hence, in order to make the deed operative, the bond must be produced, or its existence, at the time of the execution of the deed by the personal representative, must be established by the proof. Bartlett v. Watson, 35 Tenn. 287, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1855).

        As against third persons, perhaps, the recital of the obligation, or bond, in the conveyance, if sufficiently full and explicit, would be prima facie sufficient. Bartlett v. Watson, 35 Tenn. 287, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1855).

        The personal representative may protect the personal estate which he represents by making a conveyance in fulfillment of the decedent's contract, if properly demanded, and if he refuses to do this in a proper case, he is liable at common law for damages.

        The heirs of the deceased maker of a written contract or title bond for the conveyance of land must be made parties to a bill to compel the personal representative to make a deed, because the title is in them by descent. Hale v. Darter, 24 Tenn. 79, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1844).
       </p>

        The court of chancery has no power to compel the execution of a deed by a personal representative unless the heirs are made a party. Hale v. Darter, 24 Tenn. 79, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1844).

        Suit for specific performance of contract for sale of land was properly brought against administrator of deceased landowner and also against his heirs who were necessary parties. Brister v.

        After the expiration of seven years from the death of the maker of the contract or title bond, the personal representative has no power to make a deed, and specific performance will not be decreed against the heirs where they rely upon the statute of limitation of seven years. Smith v. Hickman's Heirs, 3 Tenn. 330, 1 Cooke 330, 1813 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1813); Lewis's Ex'rs v. Hickman's Heirs & Adm'rs, 2 Tenn. 316, 2 Tenn. 317, 1814 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1814).

       <p>
        A suit by a creditor against the heirs of a testator to recover real property is not barred by a seven year statute of limitations when a judgment has been recovered against the personal representative of the estate within the seven years if the suit against the heirs is commenced within seven years after recovery of the judgment against the personal representatives. Wooldridge v. Page, 68 Tenn. 325, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1878); Woolridge v. Page, 69 Tenn. 135, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1878).

       <p>
        The ancestor took and in writing agreed to hold the title of land in trust for himself and others, his heirs claiming and holding the land, for seven years after the ancestor's death, are protected, without having had any actual possession of the land, notwithstanding the recognition of such trust by the ancestor's personal representative, having only a naked power to sell the land; and notwithstanding such recognition by the heirs themselves, unless it is equivalent to a valid assumption of the claim or trust on the part of the heirs. Henderson v. Tipton, 88 Tenn. 255, 14 S.W. 380, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Sep. 1889).

        It is not necessary that the contract or title bond of the deceased be registered in order to give validity to the deed of his personal representative. While the personal representative is not bound to make the deed until the title bond is registered, yet if he should do so, the deed is good. Carter v. Parrot, 1 Tenn. 237, 1807 Tenn.

         Trial court erred in ruling for a landowner in his action against an adjacent landowner to quiet title to a strip of land, which the parties'  referred to as the interlock, because the landowner's deed to the interlock was champertous and thus, void; the adjacent landowner's act of enclosing a portion of the interlock in a fence constituted actual possession of that portion of the interlock, and the adjacent landowner held the entire interlock under color of title because the metes and bounds description of the land conveyed to him contained the interlock, which meant that he was in constructive possession of the entire interlock when a purchaser purportedly conveyed it to the landowner.

        <p>
         At common law, maintenance was an officious intermeddling in a suit that in no way belonged to one, by maintaining or assisting either party, with money or otherwise, to prosecute or defend it, and signified the maintenance of a suit or quarrel to the disturbance or hindrance of right. But this rigid doctrine, as it was held at an early period, has been greatly modified in modern decisions, so that a man may maintain the suit of his near kinsman, servant, or poor neighbor, out of charity and compassion, with impunity. Sherley v. Riggs, 30 Tenn. 53, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1850); Hayney v. Coyne, 57 Tenn. 339, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 430 (1872).
        </p>
        <p>
         At common law, if a suit was founded upon a champertous contract, such suit would be dismissed upon the champerty appearing, but not merely because there was a champertous contract, with relation to its prosecution, between the plaintiff and his attorney, or between the plaintiff and another layman. Robertson & Hobbs v. Cayard, 111 Tenn. 356, 77 S.W. 1056, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1903); Staub v. Sewanee Coal, Coke & Land Co., 140 Tenn. 505, 205 S.W. 320, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1918).

        <p>
         By the repeal of the champerty laws contained in §§ 3176-3184 of the Code of 1896, the state changed its policy on that subject. Heaton v. Dennis, 103 Tenn. 155, 52 S.W. 175, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1899).
        </p>
        <p>
         The question whether the repeal of former champerty laws operated to revive the common law of champerty is reserved, and it is held to be clear that the repeal did not leave in force a penalty which existed only by virtue of the repealed statutes. Robertson & Hobbs v. Cayard, 111 Tenn. 356, 77 S.W. 1056, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1903).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the repeal of the former champerty law, a suit will not be dismissed by reason of a champertous contract between plaintiff and his attorney or a third person. Staub v. Sewanee Coal, Coke & Land Co., 140 Tenn. 505, 205 S.W. 320, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1918).

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         The object and policy of the champerty statute is that those in actual possession of land shall not be molested by suits founded upon pretended or dormant claims, unless such suits shall be instituted and conducted, bona fide, by the proper owners, upon whom the law has cast the title, for their own proper benefit and at their own proper risk and costs. Williams v. Hogan, 19 Tenn. 187, 1838 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1838); Ruffin v. Johnson, 52 Tenn. 604, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 291 (1871); Lenoir v. Mining Co., 88 Tenn. 168, 14 S.W. 378, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1889). See Todd v. Cannon, 27 Tenn. 512, 1847 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1847).
        </p>
        <p>
         The object is to prevent fraud and oppression in the buying up of outstanding titles of a doubtful and disputed character, whereby to harass those in possession, who are often poor and ignorant, and unable to protect themselves against a rich and powerful antagonist. Chairs v. Hobson, 29 Tenn. 354, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1849). See Sims's Lessee v. Cross, 18 Tenn. 460, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1837).
        </p>
        <p>
         The champerty statutes prohibit the sale of a pretended interest in real property. Burnette v. Pickel, 858 S.W.2d 319, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993), appeal denied, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 265 (Tenn. July 6, 1993).

         Sound policy does not require the champerty statutes to be extended upon doubtful construction. McCoy's Lessee v. Williford, 32 Tenn. 642, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 99 (1853).
        </p>
        <p>
         This statute makes utterly void every sale or grant of land adversely held without regard to the length of adverse possession and without regard to whether the vendor's title is valid or invalid where the vendor is out of possession at the time of making the deed. Blair v. Gwosdof, 46 Tenn. App. 314, 329 S.W.2d 366, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (1959).

        </p>
        <p>
         In a suit by a grantee to recover the purchase price paid the grantor, the fact that grantee elected to contest the suit filed by the persons who held the land adversely at the time of the conveyance could not change the fact that the deed was champertous and void when executed or to extend the limitation within which the action for recovery of the purchase price must be brought. Kitchen-Miller Co. v. Kern, 170 Tenn. 10, 91 S.W.2d 291, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (1936).

        <p>
         Champerty cannot be predicated in a deed void for uncertainty, vagueness, and insufficiency of description, so that it identifies no particular tract or parcel of land; and a possession under such deed will protect the possessor only to the extent of his actual possession or enclosures, and a conveyance of the land by a third person will be champertous only to the extent of the actual possession or enclosures.

         Where the adverse claimant has kept up, on the land for about 20 years or more, a house, stable, and lot fenced and cattle were kept thereon, cabins built, coal openings made, and kept up; such possession is held to be open, obvious, notorious, continuous, and adverse. Savage v. Bon Air Coal, Land & Lumber Co., 2 Tenn. Ch. App. 594 (1902).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the defendant, holding title to the land in controversy under a prior unregistered deed, attempted to defeat complainant's title under a subsequent and registered deed, upon the ground that defendant's adverse possession at the time of the execution of such subsequent deed rendered it champertous, such occupancy was not sufficiently open and adverse to render the deed, under which complainant claimed, void for champerty, where it appeared that defendant's occupation consisted merely of a bridge extending a few feet over the land, and also the piling of some refuse lumber thereon, without showing how long the lumber remained thereon, or whether it was there when such subsequent deed was executed. Campbell v. Home Ice & Coal Co., 126 Tenn. 524, 150 S.W. 427, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1912). See also Gernt v. Floyd, 131 Tenn. 119, 174 S.W. 267, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1915).
        </p>
        <p>
         The adverse possession, in order to make a conveyance void for champerty, must at least be as high in character as the adverse possession necessary to give title by its continuance under the statute of limitations. Gernt v. Floyd, 131 Tenn. 119, 174 S.W. 267, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1915), approving Green v. Cumberland Coal & Coke Co., 110 Tenn. 35, 72 S.W. 459, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1903); Campbell v.

        </p>
        <p>
         Where a tract of land was capable of cultivation in ample part, and the possession consisted of intermittent cuttings of timber and the erection of an unenclosed and unlocked lumber shack for use as “bachelor quarters” during the logging season only, which structure even was not openly or notoriously occupied at the date of the alleged champertous conveyance, there was no such adverse possession as would make a conveyance by the owner champertous. Gernt v. Floyd, 131 Tenn. 119, 174 S.W. 267, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1915). See also Savage v. Bon Air Coal, Land & Lumber Co., 2 Tenn. Ch. App. 594 (1902); Campbell v.

         A person claiming land, without any color or assurance of title describing the boundaries to which he claims, is in possession only to the extent of his actual possession; and a sale and conveyance of the tract of land by a person not in possession is champertous only to the extent of the actual possession, and is valid as to the remaining portion of the tract conveyed.

         Where a person holds, under assurance or color of title, the adverse possession of a smaller tract within the boundaries of a larger one, a sale and conveyance of the larger tract, without excluding the smaller one, is champertous only to the extent of the smaller tract, and is valid as to the other portion of the larger tract.

         Where there is an actual adverse possession of some part of the tract of land held under an assurance of title, the possessor has such constructive possession of the rest of the tract superior and adverse to that which results merely from the ownership of the legal title as renders a conveyance of land so held, made by the real owner out of possession void for champerty, as to the whole tract, and not merely to the extent of the actual possession.

         It does not require any length of adverse possession, even by a disclaiming tenant, to make a sale and conveyance of land, or of any interest therein, or a lease thereof champertous when the land is so adversely possessed by another. The fact that the land is adversely held is enough, and that fact occurs in the case of a tenant as soon as his disclaimer is known to the landlord. Bullard v. Copps, 21 Tenn. 409, 1841 Tenn.

         trial court properly quieted title to the disputed property to the plaintiffs based on an oral boundary agreement between the parties'  predecessors in interest because, aside from a maple tree, all three surveyors disputed the meaning and the location of the key reference points forming the original boundary, and there was no testimony as to the condition of a fence at the time of the conveyance to the plaintiffs, which was key to the defendant's champerty claim.

         When the conveyance is void for champerty, the title remains in the grantor, so as to enable him to maintain an action of ejectment upon it, and the void deed cannot be set up by a third person to the prejudice of his title; and, therefore, he may sue and recover the land, though such recovery inures to the benefit of the purchaser, by way of estoppel against the grantor; or the purchaser may maintain an action of ejectment, joining a count on the demise of the grantor, and in this mode recover the lands conveyed to him.

         Where the grantor and grantee in a champertous deed join as complainants in an ejectment bill in chancery to recover, in the name of the grantor, for the use and benefit of the grantee, the land so conveyed, which bill shows upon its face the champertous character of the sale and conveyance, the court will refuse the relief, and dismiss the bill.

        <p>
         Separate counts are necessary for the several plaintiffs in an action of ejectment, where there is a champertous deed between the plaintiffs; and it is not decided in any of the cases that a recovery would be allowed even at law, where there is a joint count showing the champerty between the parties so joined. It is doubtful whether the rule allowing the grantor to recover in ejectment at law from a third party the land conveyed by his champertous deed ever had an application to a case where the pleadings disclosed where the true title was vested by the champertous deed. Lenoir v. Mining Co., 88 Tenn. 168, 14 S.W. 378, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1889). See Williams v. Hogan, 19 Tenn. 187, 1838 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1838); Cole v. Stewart's Heirs, 49 Tenn. 510, 1871 Tenn.

        <p>
         Where the grantor files his ejectment bill in chancery to recover the land so conveyed, but does not show in his bill the champertous deed, it cannot be set up by way of defense to defeat his suit though it be shown that the suit is, in fact, prosecuted in the name of the champertous grantor for the use and benefit of the champertous grantee, and at the latter's cost and expense.

         The grantor in a champertous deed may disregard it, and in his own name sue in ejectment to recover the land from a third party; and, if the defendant proves the existence of such conveyance, the grantor may show its champertous character, and consequent invalidity in avoidance, and he may do this without specially pleading the invalidity of such conveyance.

         An action at law cannot be maintained against the grantor in a champertous deed for the breach of his covenant of the warranty of title; and if the fact of the adverse possession at the time of the execution of the deed appears in the declaration, a demurrer thereto will be sustained. Williams v. Hogan, 19 Tenn. 187, 1838 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1838); Waters v. Hutton, 85 Tenn. 109, 1 S.W. 787, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1886); Rich v. Scales, 116 Tenn. 57, 91 S.W. 50, 1905 Tenn.

         The true rule in chancery should be that if the land adversely held was really sold and taken into the account in estimating the price, the vendor ought not to be allowed to retain that part of the purchase money represented by the lost land, and that chancery should entertain a bill for compensation in such case, upon the ground that the sale and conveyance, to the extent that it was thus champertous, is void. But, if the purchaser knew at the time that the land was adversely held, and that, too, by a paramount title, and this part of the land was not really intended to be sold or estimated in fixing the price, then the vendor ought not, in equity, to be liable upon his covenant or otherwise. Bradley v. Dibbrell, 50 Tenn. 522, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 108 (1871); Ruffin v. Johnson, 52 Tenn. 604, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 291 (1871); Williams v. Burg, 77 Tenn. 455, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1882); Waters v.

         Where at the time of the execution of a warranty deed the land was in the adverse possession of others under color of title, the deed was champertous and void so that the grantee had no right of action on the covenant of warranty but could maintain a suit in equity for recovery of the purchase price if it had no actual knowledge of the adverse possession at the time it took the deed and if the suit was brought within the period of limitation after discovery of the champertous nature of the transaction.

        <p>
         The assignment of a bid, made after the sale has been set aside and the biddings reopened, and after another sale has been made, is the sale of a “pretended claim,” and is illegal, though the decree setting aside the sale and reopening the biddings was entered at the next term, nunc pro tunc; and such assignee's appeal from the decree refusing to allow him to become the purchaser, and confirming the sale to the purchaser under the reopened biddings, will be dismissed.

         Landowner's action against an adjacent landowner to quiet title to a strip of land, which the parties'  referred to as the interlock, had to be dismissed because the landowner's deed to the interlock was champertous and thus, void; the adjacent landowner's act of enclosing a portion of the interlock in a fence constituted actual possession of that portion of the interlock, and the adjacent landowner held the entire interlock under color of title because the metes and bounds description of the land conveyed to him contained the interlock, which meant that he was in constructive possession of the entire interlock when a purchaser purportedly conveyed it to the landowner.

         Law of champerty did not apply because the church legally purchased the property in 1974 and, thus, the church was the rightful owner of the property, although it did not record its deed.

         Trial court erred in ruling for a landowner in his action against an adjacent landowner to quiet title to a strip of land, which the parties'  referred to as the interlock, because the landowner's deed to the interlock was champertous and thus, void; the adjacent landowner's act of enclosing a portion of the interlock in a fence constituted actual possession of that portion of the interlock, and the adjacent landowner held the entire interlock under color of title because the metes and bounds description of the land conveyed to him contained the interlock, which meant that he was in constructive possession of the entire interlock when a purchaser purportedly conveyed it to the landowner.

        Devises in this state, without words of inheritance or the use of the term “heirs,” always passed the devisor's entire estate in the land, and operated to pass a fee simple estate, if the devisor owned such estate in the land, unless the contrary intent plainly appeared in the will.

        The purpose of this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c01s66-1-101" target="_self">66-1-101</a></cite> was to abolish the common law rule requiring words of inheritance as an indispensable prerequisite to the creation of an absolute estate in fee simple.

        Since the passage of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c01s66-1-101" target="_self">66-1-101</a></cite> and this section, a grant to “A” or to “A and his heirs” means one and the same thing and vests in the grantee the same quantum of interest.

        The vestiture of title “in Mary Hamby,” and the vestiture of title “in Mary Hamby and her heirs,” would be, in legal effect, precisely the same; and either would purport to vest in Mary Hamby an absolute title in fee.

        The entire “terms of the instrument” may be considered in order to ascertain the estate actually intended to be vested in the grantee. Beecher v. Hicks, 75 Tenn. 207, 1881 Tenn.

        In determining what estate the grantor intended to convey, the deed as a whole is to be considered and the intention of the grantor gathered by giving all the words used their appropriate meaning.

       <p>
        The use of the word “assigns” in the granting clause and habendum of a deed imports an intention to give the grantee the power to sell and dispose of the property, and, therefore, creates a fee simple estate in the grantee.

        The first clause in a deed when in conflict with a subsequent clause, and the last clause in a will when in conflict with a preceding clause, must prevail; but this is only where there is an irreconcilable repugnance, and both clauses in the deed or will cannot stand. There is no such repugnance where the last clause in a deed does no more than extend and enlarge the first clause. Meredith v. Owen, 36 Tenn. 223, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1856); Frank v.

        Where the premises convey a life estate, and the habendum enlarges such estate to an absolute estate, the habendum is not repugnant to the premises, because it only extends and enlarges the estate given by the premises.

        Courts refuse to cut down an estate already granted in fee or absolutely, when the supposed terms of limitation are to be found in some subsequent portion of the will, and are not, in themselves, clear, unmistakable and certain, so that there can be no doubt of the meaning and intention of the testator.

       </p>

        If the expression in the will is doubtful, the doubt is resolved against the limitation and in favor of the absolute estate, and clause in will of childless wife bequeathing to her husband all her property, real and personal, “to be used by him for his support and comfort during his life” conferred absolute estate upon the husband.

        One who makes a deed conveying all his right, title, estate, and interest in certain described lands, or who uses equivalent words, necessarily refers to his title papers, and the deed conveys whatever interest those title papers show that he has; and where his title papers do not convey a title to him in fact and law, but only purport to do so, the effect would be the same, that is, the deed would carry whatever force or effect such assurance has under our statutes of limitation.

        Conveyances by executory devisees and contingent remaindermen may be operative to pass or convey the after acquired estate, interest, or title, if there be a general warranty of title, because such warranty operates as an estoppel to deny the title of the warantee.

        The deed of conveyance of land by the executory devisees in the estate, who are ascertained and named, or the deed by the contingent remaindermen, operates to pass their present and future estate or interest acquired upon the happening of any contingency provided for in the will or deed, unless a contrary intent appears. The grantee steps into their shoes, taking their chances for future interests as well as their present estate. Bruce v. Goodbar, 104 Tenn. 638, 58 S.W. 282, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1900).

        The express conveyance or release of either the homestead or dower in a deed of trust or mortgage leaves the right to the one not so expressly conveyed or released unaffected, for the express conveyance of one is the exclusion of the other.

        The wife's right to homestead was not defeated by the fact that her husband made to her a voluntary conveyance of the homestead property, which conveyance was subsequently set aside at a suit by the husband's creditors, as the conveyance was merely fraudulent in law; thus her application for assignment of homestead was not barred, after remand to execute the decree, there being no question of homestead made in the original pleadings.

        A devise or conveyance of the rents and profits, or the income of the land, is equivalent to a devise or conveyance of the land itself; and, if unlimited, there is vested in the devisee or grantee an absolute fee-simple title to the land, without the use of the term “heirs,” or other words of inheritance, notwithstanding no express power of alienation is conferred upon the devisee or grantee. However, the devise or conveyance of the rents and profits may be for life of the devisee or grantee, and then there is vested in him only a life estate in the land; and such devise or conveyance of the rents and profits may be in remainder, and in that case, there is vested in the devisee or grantee a remainder estate in the land.

        The rule that a devise or grant of the rents and profits of land is equivalent to a devise or grant of land itself only applies where no active trust is interposed, for, in such case, the devisee or grantee takes only the equitable estate which is not subject to levy and sale under execution at law.

        While a conveyance of land to a mother and her children, without qualifying words, will generally vest the title in the mother and her then living children as tenants in common, to the exclusion of after born children, a slight indication will induce the courts to adopt the other construction. To effectuate this purpose the mother will be converted into a tenant for life, and the children into remaindermen, the remainders vesting in the children living when the instrument became effective, and the estate opening upon the subsequent birth of children so as to embrace them; or else the mother will be held to be a trustee for herself and her then living children as well as her after born children.

Benton v. Pope, 24 Tenn. 392, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1844); Bearden v. Taylor, 42 Tenn. 134, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1865).

However, where there is a trust by deed or will, or a remainder is conveyed to present and future children of a certain person, or there is a postponement of the division or enjoyment of the property until they all come into being, the after born children will take with the children in being when the deed or will creating such estate shall become effective.

        Where a life estate or other particular estate is conveyed or devised to one, with an executory limitation or remainder over to another, and an absolute, unlimited, or unqualified power of disposition of the whole property or estate is given the first taker, it is a rule of property, regardless of the evident intention, that an executory limitation or remainder over, dependent upon the nondisposition of the first taker, is void, and an absolute estate is vested in the first taker; but, where the power of disposition given the first taker is contingent, limited, or qualified, the executory limitation or remainder over becomes effective when the property has not been disposed of within or according to the power; or where the power of disposition arises, by operation of law, as the mere incident to or consequence of the fee simple estate devised, the subsequent limitation over by way of executory devise is valid.

        It is a rule of property that an unlimited power of disposition gives the first taker an absolute estate, though in contravention of the actual or evident intention it is otherwise if the power of disposition is limited or contingent. McGavock v. Pugsley, 59 Tenn. 689, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1874); Pool v. Pool, 78 Tenn. 486, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1882); McKnight v. McKnight, 120 Tenn. 431, 115 S.W. 134, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1908).

       <p>
        Though the owner of a life estate, empowered to sell the property, thought that she owned the fee and conveyed in fee simple under that impression, without specifically intending to exercise the power to sell and convey, her deed was a sufficient execution of the power, since a grantor parts with all title she may or can convey, unless a contrary intention appears. Young v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 101 Tenn. 311, 47 S.W. 428, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1898); Matthews v. Capshaw, 109 Tenn. 480, 72 S.W. 964, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 88, 97 Am. St. Rep. 854 (1902).

        The power of disposition to be implied from the mere ownership has no application to the rule that unlimited power of disposition vests absolute estate in first taker. Scruggs v. Mayberry, 135 Tenn. 586, 188 S.W. 207, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 197 (1915).

        A devise or bequest of property to one, with a provision that upon his death it shall go to and descend to his children, vests an absolute estate in the first taker, with a conditional limitation over, in the nature of an executory devise to his children upon his death, and if he dies leaving any children, they will take the property under the will.

        A son's devise of land to his widowed mother “to and for her own use and benefit absolutely, provided that she does not marry again,” with limitation over to another in the event of her remarriage, does not invest her with an absolute estate in fee, but with a contingent estate in fee, determinable upon her remarriage. The estate did not become absolute in the mother, because the power of disposition was not given to her, either expressly or by necessary implication, by superadded words, as required by the rule. The limitation over is valid, and takes effect upon the mother's remarriage. Overton v. Lea, 108 Tenn. 505, 68 S.W. 250, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1901).

Overton v. Lea, 108 Tenn. 505, 68 S.W. 250, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1901); Bradford v. Leake, 124 Tenn. 312, 137 S.W. 96, 1912D Am. Ann. Cas. 1140, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1910).

        Where the testator devised a life estate to his daughters, with remainder in fee to their children, and in default of children by them, then to the testator's children who should then be living, the remainder was vested in such of the testator's grandchildren, children of the daughters, as were in existence when the will became effective and contingent in the case of any daughter who at that time was without children.

        Under a devise or bequest of property to one, to be held by trustees for his use and benefit during his natural life, and at his death to be equally divided among his children, the gift becomes absolute upon his death with no children, for the testator did not, in that event, die intestate as to the remainder, so that the same would go to his heirs and distributees under the statutes of descent and distribution.

        A deed conditioned that the grantee shall support the grantor passes title immediately, provision for a reversion to grantor, and breach, notwithstanding. The remedy of the grantor is in equity for enforcement of a lien on the realty and not for a rescission, even where there is a total breach. Goodman v. Skeleton, 2 Tenn. Ch.

        There was a statutory presumption that the 1921 deed conveyed to the grantee the entirety of the grantors'  interest, and while defendants attempted to rebut that presumption by claiming the deed showed an intention to grant a mere easement for railroad purposes, the use of the phrase right of way in the descriptive clause was merely intended to describe rather than to limit the use of the railroad corridor conveyed in the granting clause.

        The statutory provisions disclose a clear legislative intent to reduce the forms of conveyance to their simplest elements, and to give the largest meaning to granting words, unless limited by the instrument itself. Daly v. Willis, 73 Tenn. 100, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1880); Hanks v. Folsom, 79 Tenn. 555, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1883). See Fogarty v. Stack, 86 Tenn. 610, 8 S.W. 846, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1888); Teague v. Sowder, 121 Tenn. 132, 114 S.W. 484, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1908); Southern Iron & Coal Co. v. Schwoon, 124 Tenn. 176, 135 S.W. 785, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Successor developer validly succeeded to the rights of a prior developer because the deed between the developers identified the real property at issue and conveyed that property with the appurtenances, estate, title and interest thereto, as the deed stated the successor took title to the real property subject to a declaration, which, in turn, clearly (1) spoke to the development of the real property owned at the time by the prior developer, (2) referred to the impending creation of a charter, bylaws, a homeowners'  association, and a board, and (3) identified the “developer” as the prior developer “and its successors and assigns.” Hughes v. New Life Dev. Corp., 387 S.W.3d 453, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Nov. 19, 2012).
       </p>

         2. Form of Conveyance.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        A deed written by the grantor himself, and containing his signature in the usual granting clause, namely, “I, A B, have sold, and do hereby sell and convey,” would be good, if actually delivered to the grantee as the deed of the grantor. Saunders v. Hackney, 78 Tenn. 194, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 163 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        A quitclaim deed is a form of conveyance; and like other deeds, it conveys whatever interest the grantor has in the land, unless otherwise specially limited by its terms. Campbell v. Home Ice & Coal Co., 126 Tenn. 524, 150 S.W. 427, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1912); Manhattan Sav. Bank & Trust Co. v. Bedford, 161 Tenn. 187, 30 S.W.2d 227, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an instrument contained a recital of the consideration, the retention of a lien to secure deferred payments, the conveying clause, the covenants of seizin, possession, against incumbrances and general warranty, and it was executed, acknowledged for registration and registered in the form and manner prescribed for deeds of conveyance, it had all the essentials for the conveyance of a present interest and estate against the contention that the instrument was a will. Smith v. Prichard, 22 Tenn. App. 321, 122 S.W.2d 829, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 34 (1938).

       <p>
        Agreement to execute and deliver a deed at some time in the future that would convey an interest in the property in question was not an expression of the debtor's present and actual intent to convey an interest in the property. Limor v. Daniel (In re Gee), 166 B.R. 314, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 2142 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1993).
       </p>

         4. —Description of Property.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Because the description contained in the deed failed to identify a particular tract of land, extrinsic evidence was not admissible to supply the location of the land in question, and thus the description was insufficient under Tennessee law. CC Holdings (Tenn.), Inc. v. Tennessee Gas Transp., Inc., 169 B.R. 643, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1177 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deed of trust referred necessarily to some existing tract of land, and its terms could be applied to that one tract only. The outcome therefore, had to be the same as in ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. v. Southern Security Federal Credit Union, 372 S.W.3d 121 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2011): the deed of trust sufficiently designated the land intended to be mortgaged with reasonable certainty as required under Tennessee law. Jahn v. FirstBank (in re Jones), — B.R. —, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 3972 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. Sept. 23, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because an appellate court was unable to determine whether a deed conveyed a tract of land to the grantees, the court remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of whether the tract was included in a referenced estate. If the trial court determined that tract was, in fact, included in the estate, then the property description was adequate to convey the tract to the grantees. Valentine v. Holt, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 25 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2020).

        The words “bargained and sold” may operate as a conveyance of land. Hanks v. Folsom, 79 Tenn. 555, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1883); Southern Iron & Coal Co. v. Schwoon, 124 Tenn. 176, 135 S.W. 785, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1911).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        No particular form or appropriate words are essential to indicate the grantor's intention, for it is sufficient if the deed, however short and inartfully drawn it may be, contains words showing it to be the intention of the maker to pass an estate from himself to the other party. Jackson v. Dillon's Lessee, 2 Tenn. 261, 1814 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1814).
       </p>
       <p>
        The same words may be construed as an agreement to convey, or as operating as an actual conveyance, according to the intention of the parties to be gathered from the context. Hanks v. Folsom, 79 Tenn. 555, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the vendor accepted the cash payment on land and, at the request of the agent for both parties, signed the deed to the grantees paying the consideration, which deed had been prepared by the common agent, it was immaterial whether the vendor knew the exact names of the grantees or not, since she clearly intended to convey to the customers produced by the agent. Gill v. McKinney, 140 Tenn. 549, 205 S.W. 416, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1918), overruled in part, Robinson v. Trousdale County, 516 S.W.2d 626, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (Tenn. 1974), superseded by statute as stated in, Third Nat'l Bank v. Knobler, — S.W.2d —, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 655 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 21, 1988), overruled on other grounds, Robinson v.

       <p>
        It is not essential to its validity to express any consideration in a deed; and it is not necessary that it be grounded upon a valuable consideration, if it be supported by a good consideration. Jackson v. Dillon's Lessee, 2 Tenn. 261, 1814 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1814); Taul v. Campbell, 15 Tenn. 318, 15 Tenn. 319, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1835); Whitby v. Whitby, 36 Tenn. 473, 1857 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        The recital of a consideration in a title bond is not essential to its validity. Whitby v. Whitby, 36 Tenn. 473, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1857), overruled in part, Blair v. Brownson, 197 S.W.3d 681, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 603 (Tenn. 2006); Perry v. Central S.R.R., 45 Tenn. 138, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1867); White v. Blakemore, 76 Tenn. 49, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1881).

       <p>
        It is sufficient, although the name of the signer does not appear in the body or operative parts of the deed, and the pronoun “I” is, by an evidently clerical error, omitted in one place, but the omission is supplied by the context and other recitals and parts of the deed.

        This section was enacted for the protection of ordinary agents and attorneys from personal liability upon the contracts of their principals, when executed in accordance with the statute, which is in accord with the ancient common law in Comb's Case, 9 Coke's Rep., which protects all trustees alike from personal liability when the face of the paper itself shows clearly that they do not intend to bind themselves personally. Wyatt v. Davidson, 1 Shan. 613 (1876).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is not to limit the mandatory forms of execution of an instrument by an agent to those specified, but is intended to protect agents from personal liability on instruments executed in their fiduciary capacities. Bush v. Cathey, 598 S.W.2d 777, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 385, 11 A.L.R.4th 881 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        To authorize the execution of a deed in the name of another, the authority must be by deed; and no previous parol assent or subsequent adoption will bind the party, unless the deed be acknowledged and redelivered. Turbeville v. Ryan, 20 Tenn. 113, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 27, 34 Am. Dec. 622 (1839); Napier v. Catron, 21 Tenn. 534, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1841); Boyd v. Dodson, 24 Tenn. 37, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1844); Smith v. Dickinson, 25 Tenn. 261, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 75, 44 Am. Dec. 306 (1845); Mosby v. Arkansas, 36 Tenn. 324, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1857); McNutt v. McMahan, 38 Tenn. 98, 1858 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        To authorize an agent to execute a deed in the name of another as his principal the authority must be by deed or by writing of equal formality with a deed. Lowe v. Wright, 40 Tenn. App. 525, 292 S.W.2d 413, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 156 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

        A deed, showing on its face that it is executed by the grantor as attorney in fact, but signed by attorney's name only, conveys the title of his principal. McCreary v. McCorkle, 54 S.W. 53, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 105 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the plain meaning of the statute would seem to indicate that the instrument on its face must reflect the agency when executed by an agent who simply writes the name of the principal, the act of a husband in affixing his wife's initials to a counter-offer at her request was well within the spirit of the statute. Bush v. Cathey, 598 S.W.2d 777, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 385, 11 A.L.R.4th 881 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

        A deed binds a corporation, though not signed by the corporate name, where it purports on its face to be the deed of the corporation, recites in the testimonial clause that the corporation has caused its corporate seal and the names of its president and secretary to be attached thereto, and which in fact bears the corporate seal, and is signed by its president and secretary in their official capacities. Rawlings v. New Memphis Gaslight Co., 105 Tenn. 268, 60 S.W. 206, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 76, 80 Am. St. Rep. 880 (1900); Turner v. Kingston Lumber & Mfg. Co., 106 Tenn. 1, 58 S.W. 854, 1900 Tenn.

        The deed of a private corporation is ineffectual to pass legal title to realty where it recites no authority for its execution and is signed by an individual as president without affixing a corporate seal, and which purports to be acknowledged by him personally, only. Garrett v. Belmont Land Co., 94 Tenn. 459, 29 S.W. 726, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1895).

        A deed signed in his own name by an attorney in fact is good notwithstanding he did not sign the name of his principal thereto, the deed showing on its face the capacity in which he was acting. McCreary v. McCorkle, 54 S.W. 53, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 105 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a deed is executed by a trustee, and it appears on its face that it was executed by him in the character of trustee, the principle of this section applies, though deed be signed and acknowledged as an individual only.

        Trial court should not have answered a jury question during deliberations as to whether, if the decedent's adult stepchild had a power of attorney, could the stepchild sign a will and deed for the decedent in the affirmative or negative, and it should not have given a supplemental instruction concerning instruments to real property that were signed by an agent or attorney for a principal, but, instead, should have merely instructed the jury to render a verdict based on the jury instructions previously given. However, the error was harmless. Johnson-Murray v. Burns, 525 S.W.3d 625, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2017).

        The statute abolished the old English modes of conveyance, and excluded all modes other than that by deed, and has formed a common law on the subject in this state, which cannot be disregarded. Upon this statute, all our registry acts are grounded, and registration is substituted for the livery of seizin and for the attornment of the tenants on the land. Hampton's Lessee v.

        Trial court correctly concluded that appellant abandoned its interest, if any, in the separated mineral interests underlying a portion of appellee's property, and that the separated mineral interests reverted to appellee as appellant failed to show a use of the property in the 20 years preceding the filing of its statement of claim in 2008 because, if any payments were made during the statutory period, the payments could not constitute “royalties” as there was no dispute that no oil, gas, or minerals were ever produced by appellant from appellee's property; and there were no payments made at any time during the relevant period that could possibly constitute the payment of rentals regarding appellee's property.

        This part applies only with respect to transfers by sale, exchange, installment land sales contract or lease with option to buy residential real property consisting of not less than one (1) nor more than four (4) dwelling units, including site-built and nonsite-built homes, whether or not the transaction is consummated with the assistance of a licensed real estate broker or salesperson. The disclosure statement referenced in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c05s66-5-202" target="_self">66-5-202</a></cite> is not a warranty of any kind by a seller and is not a substitute for inspections either by the individual purchasers or by a professional home inspector. The disclosure required by this part shall be provided to potential buyers for their exclusive use and may not be relied upon by purchasers in subsequent transfers from the original purchaser who received the property disclosure. The required disclosure shall be given in good faith by the owner or owners of property that is being transferred and shall be subject to the requirements of this part.

        A real estate licensee representing an owner of residential real property as the listing broker has a duty to inform each such owner represented by that licensee of the owner's rights and obligations under this part. A real estate licensee representing a purchaser of residential real property or, if the purchaser is not represented by a licensee, the real estate licensee representing an owner of residential real estate and dealing with the purchaser has a duty to inform each such purchaser of the purchaser's rights and obligations under this part. If a real estate licensee performs those duties, the licensee shall have no further duties to the parties to a residential real estate transaction under this part, and shall not be liable to any party to a residential real estate transaction for a violation of this part or for any failure to disclose any information regarding any real property subject to this part. However, a cause of action for damages or equitable remedies may be brought against a real estate licensee for intentionally misrepresenting or defrauding a purchaser. A real estate licensee will further be subject to a cause of action for damages or equitable relief for failing to disclose adverse facts of which the licensee has actual knowledge or notice. “Adverse facts” means conditions or occurrences generally recognized by competent licensees that significantly reduce the structural integrity of improvements to real property, or present a significant health risk to occupants of the property.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person with a physical disability shall be permitted to terminate a rental lease relative to such person's primary residence without incurring penalties or being obligated to pay rent after ceasing to occupy the property if such person is accepted as a resident of a public housing facility, unless the person's current landlord has made significant modifications to the residence to address issues of accessibility for persons with a physical disability. The person with a physical disability who terminates a rental lease pursuant to this section shall present written evidence of the public housing facility acceptance to the rental leaseholder and the rental leaseholder shall provide written acknowledgement of the lease termination to the lessee. For the purposes of this section, a “person with a physical disability” means a person who meets the standard for being “permanently and totally disabled” under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.71.html#t71c04s71-4-1102" target="_blank">71-4-1102</a></cite>.

       Land purchased under execution sale subject to redemption is not held like mortgaged property as security, and loss before redemption is that of the purchaser. Hawkins v. Jamison, 8 Tenn. 83, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1827).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of redemption is not a statute of limitation, but it is treated and classified as a law of property, and not of remedy. Reynolds v. Baker, 46 Tenn. 221, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1869); Trim v. McPherson, 47 Tenn. 15, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1869).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory right of redemption is not an equitable estate or equity of redemption in the sense of the equitable estate or equity of redemption remaining in a mortgagor, for the sale and conveyance under a judgment or decree vests the whole estate in the purchaser, and nothing remains to the debtor save the statutory right of redemption, which is strictly a right of repurchase. The statutory right, from the supposed analogy between it and the equity of redemption of a mortgagor, has been sometimes spoken of as an equitable right or equitable estate. Reynolds v. Baker, 46 Tenn. 221, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1869); Smith v. Taylor, 79 Tenn. 738, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 132 (1883); Ewing v. Cook, 85 Tenn. 332, 3 S.W. 507, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 50, 4 Am. St. Rep. 765 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of redemption given by statute to both the judgment debtor and his judgment creditors (and creditors by debts acknowledged by deed as provided by statute) is not an equitable right, but a legal right to be exercised as prescribed by statute. Reynolds v. Baker, 46 Tenn. 221, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1869); Ewing v. Cook, 85 Tenn. 332, 3 S.W. 507, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 50, 4 Am. St. Rep. 765 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute is the only authority for redemption and for advancing bid. It is not a question of equity, but of strict law. Rogers v. Tindall, 99 Tenn. 356, 42 S.W. 86, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of redemption from execution sale is personal to debtor and does not depend upon actual ownership of land at time of sale since the right is predicated on the sale of the judgment debtor's interest in the land whatever that might be. Shea v. Rucker, 167 Tenn. 550, 72 S.W.2d 551, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1933).

       Where commissioner of insurance and banking (now commissioner of commerce and insurance) instituted proceedings against insurance company on the grounds that such company was insolvent but where there was no matured indebtedness of record against such company sale of real property of such insurance company under court authority was not a sale of real property for debt so as to subject such sale to the requirements of this section that such property be sold subject to a two year right of redemption since the proceedings under which such sale arose were by an officer of the state to enforce a police measure enacted for the protection of the insuring public and not by a debtor. State ex rel. Tobin v. Independent Life Ins. Co., 171 Tenn. 13, 100 S.W.2d 228, 1936 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1937).

      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory right to redeem within two years from sale is not a statute of limitations but a law of property, it is not a cause of action at law or in equity, to perfect the right requires no action at law or in equity, but merely a tender of the money. Hunt v. Liles, 35 Tenn. App. 173, 243 S.W.2d 149, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 132 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of redemption formerly allowed where property was sold for taxes was not an equity of redemption in the sense of the law of mortgages, because the whole estate passed by the sale to the purchaser leaving in the taxpayer a right to repurchase by tendering the money. Hunt v. Liles, 35 Tenn. App. 173, 243 S.W.2d 149, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 132 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A necessary condition to the right to redeem is that there must have been a sale at which a purchaser took title and the redemptioners take through him. Cannon Mills, Inc. v. Spivey, 208 Tenn. 419, 346 S.W.2d 266, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no valid sale no right to redeem existed as a result thereof. Cannon Mills, Inc. v. Spivey, 208 Tenn. 419, 346 S.W.2d 266, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a bankruptcy debtor issued deeds to properties in lieu of foreclosure to obtain an extension of a scheduled foreclosure date, the recordation of the deeds after the debtor failed to satisfy the mortgage debt before expiration of the period of extension did not impermissibly clog the debtor's redemption rights under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c08s66-8-101" target="_self">66-8-101</a></cite>, since there was no non-consensual sale of the properties for debt to implicate such rights, and the date of the foreclosure sale was extended rather than the maturity dates of notes.

       The debtors' waiver of the equity of redemption in a deed of trust effectively waived the statutory right of redemption granted in title 66, chapter 8. Swift v. Kirby, 737 S.W.2d 271, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 958 (Tenn. 1987); Nichols v. Springfield Production Credit Asso., 737 S.W.2d 277, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 964 (Tenn. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The expression “equity of redemption” by common usage throughout the period from 1820 to date has been sufficiently pervasive to include within its meaning the statutory right of redemption granted in title 66, chapter 8 and its use fulfills the requirement of an express waiver required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c08s66-8-101ol13" target="_self">66-8-101(3)</a></cite>.

       No rule exists in Tennessee validating a waiver of the equity of redemption in a mortgage or deed of trust, the effectiveness of which is limited to the period between default and consummation of a foreclosure sale. Swift v. Kirby, 737 S.W.2d 271, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 958 (Tenn. 1987).

      </p>
      <p>
       The right of redemption does not exist in the land of a decedent, sold under a decree of court for the payment of his debts. Love v. Williams, 70 Tenn. 226, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 162 (1879); Maxwell v. Smith, 86 Tenn. 539, 8 S.W. 340, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1888).

       Where, in a divorce case, certain lands of the husband, for the purpose of providing alimony for the wife, are ordered to be sold, and the proceeds, or a certain proportion of them, are decreed to be paid to the wife as her alimony, no right of redemption exists, though the decree is silent as to exemption, because such sale was not for a debt. A decree for alimony becomes a debt only when it is for a specific sum to be paid by the husband as a personal obligation or liability. White v. Bates, 89 Tenn. 570, 15 S.W. 651, 1890 Tenn.

       The right of redemption, whether existing under statute and in consequence of judicial or sheriff's sale, or under mortgage or deed of trust, is an estate or interest in the land, which may be sold, assigned, or devised, and it will descend to the debtor's heirs. The conveyance may be absolute or as a security for debt; and a conveyance of the entire interest or estate in the land, or of the land simply, without more, operates to convey only the right of redemption, and conveys such right, though it be not named by apt words.

      <p>
       The right of redemption, existing in judicial sales and foreclosure sales under mortgages and deeds of trust, is obligatory in the federal courts. The redemption in sales under mortgages and deeds of trust exists by implied contract under the law, unless it be expressly or by necessary implication cut off by the provisions of the instrument, and the federal courts must enforce the contract.

       Where the right of redemption is wrongly cut off by the decree of the federal court, a bill of review will lie to reverse such decree, and so will an appeal, but a bill of review, filed after the expiration of the redemption period, without any tender of the redemption money within such time, and without any such tender made in and accompanying the bill, seeking to let the original decree stand, and to let the sale stand, but seeking a declaration of the court that the order foreclosing the right of redemption be reversed, will not avail anything.

      <p>
       The sheriff's deed relates to the sale in all cases, and relates to the levy in some cases, and relates to the judgment when the judgment is a lien on the land, and vests the purchaser with the legal title, at least from the date of the sale. The deed relates to the levy on which it is based, so as to overreach and nullify all conveyances and other levies made subsequent to such levy, but for the purpose of vesting the legal title in the purchaser, it relates only to the date of the sale, from which date, and not before, the statutes of limitations may become operative in favor of or against the debtor or purchaser, or those claiming under them respectively, as the one or the other may be holding the actual possession and claiming adversely against the other out of possession. Garner's Lessee v. Johnston, 7 Tenn. 23, 7 Tenn. 24, 1822 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1822); Porter's Lessee v. Cocke, 7 Tenn. 29, 7 Tenn. 30, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1823); Farquhar v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The debtor's possession after the sale, whether the sheriff's deed has been taken or not, is consistent with the title of the purchaser, under whom he is presumed to hold as quasi-tenant at will, and does so hold until actual disclaimer, and a sale and conveyance by the purchaser under the execution sale, made before the disclaimer and adverse holding, is not champertous. When the disclaimer is made, the debtor's possession becomes adverse, and the statutes of limitations begin to run against the purchaser and those claiming under him. Mitchell v. Lipe, 16 Tenn. 179, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1835); Vance's Heirs v. Johnson, 29 Tenn. 214, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1849); Keaton v. Thomasson's Lessee, 32 Tenn. 138, 1852 Tenn.

       A cause of action does not arise until there has been a refusal to accept the tender, and from that point only does a statute of limitations begin to operate and until tender and refusal the debtor had no right of action against the purchaser.

       Where the right of redemption exists in the sales of land, made under decrees of the chancery court, the time allowed for redemption is computed from the date of the confirmation of the report of sale. Henderson v. Lowry, 13 Tenn. 239, 13 Tenn. 240, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1833); Lowry v. McGhee, 16 Tenn. 242, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1835); Wood v. Morgan, 23 Tenn. 371, 1843 Tenn.

LEXIS 532 (Tenn. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       In computing the time allowed for redemption, the day of the sale must be excluded. This is done upon the principle that time will be so computed as to save the right intended to be favored by the law, or to be secured by the parties to a contract. Jones v. Planters' Bank, 24 Tenn. 619, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 147 (1845); Elder v. Bradley, 34 Tenn. 247, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1854).

      <p>
       Where the purchaser, upon his refusal of the debtor's request for an extension of the redemption period, informed the debtor that the time of redemption would expire on a certain day subsequent to the true time, and agreed that the redemption might be made on or before that day, the right of redemption continued until and inclusive of that day. Pearson v. Douglass, 60 Tenn. 151, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 426 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the party entitled to redeem is misled by the sheriff's false return of the date of sale, he may redeem at any time within the two years from such false date, although the return is, without his knowledge, and by permission of the court, afterwards amended and changed to the true date, and especially is this the rule where the act of the purchaser in a sense was the cause of it. Alexander v. Bailey, 70 Tenn. 636, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 210 (1879).

       The period for redemption does not begin to run until the sale is completed by valid decree confirming the sale and divesting and vesting title. Tennessee Marble & Brick Co. v.

       The agreement for extension, made by the purchasing creditor upon the request of the debtor, will not operate as a legal estoppel, preventing the defendants in an action of ejectment by the purchaser of the land at execution sale from relying upon defects in the purchaser's title, because of defects in the proceeding under which the land was sold; for any question raised by the fact that the execution debtor, the ancestor of the defendants, applied to the creditor to purchase the land and give the debtor further time to redeem, and that the creditor agreed, and purchased accordingly, is a matter exclusively of equitable cognizance.

The tender took away the power of sale, and the sale made thereafter did not operate to bar the equity of redemption so waived in the deed of trust; and the possession of the purchaser, taken under such sale, was wrongful, and renders him liable for the rents.

Ball v. Stanley, 13 Tenn. 199, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 136, 26 Am. Dec. 263 (1833); Cooley v. Weeks, 18 Tenn. 141, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1836); Noe v. Hodges, 22 Tenn. 162, 1842 Tenn.

       The tender must be in legal tender money, if objection is made to the tender of any other kind of money, though it be equal in value to the legal tender money. Lowry v. McGhee, 16 Tenn. 242, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1835).

       The tender in redemption is sufficient where a more formal tender is prevented by the purchaser refusing to remain until the money can be counted out and offered to him, as where the debtor tenders the money, invites him into a public office for the purpose of counting it and paying it to him, but he refuses to receive it unless a condition he had no right to make was complied with, and abruptly turns off.

       A redemption bill alleging that complainant was ignorant of the amount due to the purchaser, and offering to pay it into court when the amount is ascertained, and praying that it be ascertained, and, if not paid, that the land be sold for its satisfaction, is sufficient, though no tender was made before the filing of the bill.

       Where the bill to redeem alleges that the redemption money was tendered, and offers to pay it into court, and shows other grounds of equity besides the question of tender alleged to have been made, it is error to dismiss the bill for failure to pay the redemption money into court upon an order directing it, made upon motion of defendant before answering the bill, for complainant is entitled to an answer and investigation of the facts charged in the bill.

       The objection to a bill upon the ground that the redemption money did not accompany the bill, and was not brought into court, as offered to be done, if tenable, is a matter of demurrer, and is waived if not taken advantage of by demurrer. Polk v. Mitchell, 85 Tenn. 634, 4 S.W. 221, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1887); Rogers v. Tindall, 99 Tenn. 356, 42 S.W. 86, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1897).

       The tender does not, of itself, divest the legal title out of the purchaser or the last redeeming creditor and vest it in the debtor or his creditor proposing to redeem, so as to entitle him to recover the land by ejectment. The remedy is by a bill in chancery tendering the redemption money, which must be paid into court with the filing of the bill, or at least before any decree of redemption is made, and must be paid in subject to the order of the defendant. A decree ordering the land to be sold to raise the redemption money is erroneous. Hawkins v. Jamison, 8 Tenn. 83, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1827); Elliot v. Patton, 12 Tenn. 9, 12 Tenn. 10, 1833 Tenn.

       The right of a trustee under debtor's deed of trust to redeem from a purchaser or redeeming creditor does not prevent the redemption thereof by some other judgment creditor, or creditor by debt acknowledged by deed, otherwise standing in a position to redeem, nor does such trustee's right prevent a redeeming creditor's advancement of his own bid within 20 days, especially where there was no priority existing under such deed of trust barring such redemption or advancement by such other creditors.

       Where land was sold under a deed of trust, and a judgment creditor, wishing to redeem by an agreement between all the parties, becomes the purchaser by paying the debtor a consideration and by advancing to the purchasing creditor the amount of his bid and debt, and the conveyance is effected by the purchasing creditor conveying the land back to the original debtor owner, who conveys to the third party so purchasing the equity of redemption and furnishing the redemption money, the transaction being an entire and continuous one, in consummation of the previous agreement of the parties, the mere momentary and transitory seizin of the original debtor owner, as the conduit through which the title passes, vests in him no interest or title to which a judgment lien may attach. In the absence of actual fraud, such transaction is not fraudulent in law as against other creditors. Huffaker v. Bowman, 36 Tenn. 89, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1856); Birdwell v.

       The statute barring the equity of redemption in chancery sales of land, made on the prescribed credit, was intended to benefit both the debtor and the creditor. It was intended to benefit the debtor by exposing to sale his property under such circumstances as to make it bring approximately its value, by giving time for payment to the purchaser, and it was intended to benefit the creditor by an assurance that an absolute sale will more nearly pay his debt, because buyers will give more for an absolute estate than for a contingent one.

       The equity of redemption is a favorite of the chancery court, and, to cut it off, the statute must be strictly pursued. Therefore, in order to make a decree operative and effective in destroying the right of redemption, three things must distinctly appear in it, namely as follows: (1) That the complainant made application in his bill for a sale on credit prescribed in the statute to bar the equity of redemption, and this fact so recited in the decree must also appear in the bill; (2) The specific land to be sold must be described in the decree of sale; and (3) The decree must direct that the sale be made on a credit, stating the time, which must not be less than six months nor more than two years, and the decree must in explicit terms cut off or bar the equity of redemption. Unless these facts appear in the decree, the sale will, on appeal, be set aside and a resale ordered. Burrow v. Henson, 34 Tenn. 658, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (1855); Cherry, Caldwell & Co. v.

       Where the decree of sale requires a cash payment, and bars the equity of redemption, it is not erroneous where the proof in the record at the time the decree was rendered shows that the requirement of the cash payment would not interfere with the obtaining of a full and fair price, and it is so adjudged in the decree; but the requirement of the cash payment shall not in any case exceed the amount of the costs and reasonable counsel fees, where the equity of redemption is cut off. The requirement of a cash payment will not be improper or erroneous, if the debtor or his counsel agreed to it, and the decree is based expressly upon such agreement. The application for such cash payment should be made in the bill, and its propriety should be shown by the proof; for the defendant may oppose the order requiring such cash payment. McBee v. McBee, 48 Tenn. 558, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1870); Hodges v. Copley, 58 Tenn. 332, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 267 (1872); Hughes Bros. Mfg. Co. v. Conyers, 97 Tenn. 274, 36 S.W. 1093, 1896 Tenn.

       Where the trust deed authorizes a sale for cash, free from the equity of redemption, and a foreclosure bill is filed by the beneficiary, the court may decree a sale for cash and free from the equity of redemption, because the terms of the chancery sale under a mortgage or deed of trust must conform to the contract of the parties.

       The statute giving the right of redemption to the debtor gives a similar right to his creditors. The inducement prompting the creation and bestowal of these two rights are different. The one is to enable the debtor to regain his land, and the other is to enable the creditor to secure his debt. These two rights of redemption exist independently of each other, and the one right is in no manner affected by the other. The redemption rights of the debtor and his creditors are distinct and independent rights in each to acquire the legal title of the purchaser, or last redeeming creditor, without in any manner obstructing the rights of the other. Bledsoe v. McCorry, 68 Tenn. 320, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1878); McClean v. Harris, 82 Tenn. 510, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1884).

       If the debtor himself exercises the right of redemption, and thus gets the title back in himself, the right of redemption by his creditors is gone, because entirely unnecessary, as the land is immediately subject to levy, but the debtor's assignment of his right of redemption, or his sale and conveyance purporting to convey the absolute title, without any previous redemption by himself, does not defeat the right of his creditors to redeem the land until such assignee or purchaser exercises the right.

       The purchaser may receive partial payments from the debtor, or demand the full amount in one payment. If the partial payments made within the prescribed time repay the purchase money, with interest and other lawful charges, the redemption is complete, but if such payments do not so repay such sum, the purchaser, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, becomes debtor to him whose land he has purchased for the amount of the partial payments, for such indulgence cannot be construed as a waiver of his title acquired by the purchase, and its conversion into a mortgage.

       A purchasing creditor in a legal condition to advance his own bid, or to redeem from another redeeming creditor, cannot, by bill in chancery, subject the debtor's right of redemption to the satisfaction of the balance of his debt. The statutes have prescribed a simple and economical mode of procedure for the redemption of land by the debtor and his creditors. Herndon v. Pickard, 73 Tenn. 702, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 201 (1880); Weakley v. Cockrill, 74 Tenn. 270, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 246 (1880); Templeton v. Mason, 107 Tenn. 625, 65 S.W. 25, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1901).

       Land was sold to a judgment creditor, who within 20 days appeared before the clerk and master to advance his bid, the official made and signed an entry, under the sheriff's return, on the docket to the effect that the creditor raised the bid to cover the balance of cost and debt. This entry was not a compliance with the statute and was ineffectual. The statute must be strictly followed, and applies to all judgment creditors alike. The entry was not equivalent to the receipt required, not being assigned by the creditor, and was not definite or determinate as to the amount advanced. Rogers v. Rogers, 35 S.W. 890, 1895 Tenn. Ch.

       The right of the purchasing creditor to advance his own bid is continuous and exclusive for the whole 20 days, at least until once exercised within such period, as against the debtor proposing to redeem as well as against a bona fide creditor, with a legally ascertained debt, proposing to redeem; and, if such right is exercised at any time within that period, it will render nugatory a previous tender in redemption, whether made by the debtor or his judgment creditor, or by a creditor having a debt acknowledged by deed. Hawkins v. Jamison, 8 Tenn. 83, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1827); Cooley v. Weeks, 18 Tenn. 141, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1836); Killibrew v. Elliott, 30 Tenn. 442, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 149 (1850); Hill v.

Woods v. McGavock, 18 Tenn. 133, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1836); Chester v. Greer, 24 Tenn. 26, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1844); Battle v. Shute, 40 Tenn. 547, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1859).

      </p>
      <p>
       The purchasing creditor entitled to advance his bid must be such a creditor at the time he makes the purchase, and he cannot, after his purchase, acquire, by purchase and assignment, judgments or decrees or such acknowledged debts, and advance his bid with them.

       A surety upon a debt secured by the principal debtor's deed of trust and who purchases the land at the trustee's sale, is not a creditor of such principal debtor by “debt acknowledged by deed,” so as to be entitled to advance his bid as a purchasing creditor. Such surety could only become the creditor of such principal debtor, because of the suretyship, by the payment of the debt, which fact of indebtedness should have been acknowledged by deed. Settle v.

       Where a subsequent mortgagee became the purchaser, at a sale under an execution issued upon a judgment that was a prior lien on the land, at a sum equal to the judgment debt and costs, and within 20 days advanced his bid to a certain sum by crediting the mortgage debt with the sum advanced, and thereafter the administrator of a creditor secured by a deed of trust prior to the mortgage, but inferior to the judgment lien so enforced by the execution sale, caused the trustee to sell the land, and became the purchaser thereof, and, within the redemption period, tendered to the execution purchaser and subsequent mortgagee the amount of his original bid at the execution sale, which was refused, with the claim that he was entitled, not only to that sum, but also to the amount of his advance bid, and upon a bill filed by the administrator to enforce the redemption, the court held that he was entitled to enforce the redemption, but on account of particular circumstances the supreme court gave the execution purchaser so advancing his bid the option to pay to the administrator the debt secured by the deed of trust, with interest, or to convey the land to the trustee upon the payment of the sum bid at the execution sale, with interest.

       A creditor secured by a deed of trust and purchasing at the sale thereunder is not prevented from advancing his bid, within the 20 days, by the fact that, subsequent to the execution of the deed of trust and before the sale thereunder, the makers of the deed of trust became bankrupts, and their equity of redemption passed to the assignee in bankruptcy, because such advance bid made by the purchasing creditor is to be treated as if it were his original bid. However, no other redemption can be made by such debtors or their creditors; but the assignee in bankruptcy may redeem from such purchasing creditor by tendering and paying to him the amount of his original bid and advance bid within the 20 days. Toombs v. Palmer, 51 Tenn. 331, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 170 (1871).

       Where the creditor purchases the land for a certain sum, and, thereafter, within the 20 days, he undertakes to advance his bid by procuring the sheriff to make a false return of sale to him at a price equal to the amount of the judgment debt and costs, a sum more than thrice the amount of the original bid, the sheriff's return may be impeached, and such advance will be held to be a fraud upon the redemption right of the debtor, and, where the purchasing creditor associated with himself a third person, who was not a creditor of the indebted landowner, as a joint purchaser with himself, by directing and procuring the sheriff's deed to be made to them jointly, such third party acquired no right to the land that he could assert after the purchasing creditor allowed the debtor to redeem the land, though the redemption period had expired, but such third party is entitled to reimbursement alone upon the principle that the complainant seeking equity must do equity, because the excess over the original bid advanced for the land inured to his benefit by extinguishing the balance of the judgment against him.

      A bona fide creditor, who redeems from the purchaser at the sale, shall hold the property subject to redemption by the original debtor, or any other of the original debtor's creditors, upon the same terms on which it was redeemable in the hands of the first purchaser or any person claiming under that purchaser; that is to say, by the party proposing to redeem paying or tendering to the person holding the land the amount of money paid or credited by that purchaser, with interest at the current composite prime rate as published by the federal reserve board as of the date of purchase per annum thereon, and also agreeing to pay to the debtor the further sum of ten percent (10%) or more on the sum bid for the land when sold, or crediting the debtor with that amount or more on the debt owing to the purchaser by the debtor, or with a sum equal to ten percent (10%) or more upon the judgment of the creditor, at the election of the creditor.

       The redeeming creditor is substituted to the place of the purchaser, and is, by operation of law, the assignee of the purchaser's bid, and acquires no better title than the purchaser acquired. Keeling v. Heard, 40 Tenn. 592, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 175 (1859); Edwards v. Ervin, 2 Shan. 510 (1877); McClean v. Harris, 82 Tenn. 510, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1884); Ewing v.

      <p>
       When the right of redemption is once exercised by the debtor or his assignee, no creditor can thereafter redeem. Reaves v. Bank of Hartsville, 64 S.W. 307, 1900 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 182 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1900); Fite v. Wood, 194 Tenn. 308, 250 S.W.2d 543, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 430 (1952).

       Until the right of redemption is exercised by judgment debtor or his assignee any bona fide creditor has the right under this section to redeem the land from the purchaser at the execution sale. Fite v. Wood, 194 Tenn. 308, 250 S.W.2d 543, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 430 (1952).

       The redeeming creditor, whose tender in redemption has been accepted by the purchaser, must actually make the payment or give the credit as a condition precedent to the effectuation of the redemption. Elliot v. Patton, 12 Tenn. 9, 12 Tenn. 10, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1833); Cooley v. Weeks, 18 Tenn. 141, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1836); Hill v. Walker, 46 Tenn. 424, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1869); Hurt v.

       One is a bona fide creditor by judgment in favor of himself and wife, and is entitled to exercise the right of redemption from a purchaser or holder of the land, by the payment or tender of the redemption money, and by crediting such judgment as required by statute, for he has the right to collect such judgment, and he might be treated as the agent of his wife, if necessary, in such case.

       Where judgment creditors join in the redemption of land, the one advancing the redemption money, or more than his share, must be reimbursed before there is any money to be applied to their judgments credited and advanced, after which any balance will be applied proportionately to their judgments, and, if, after satisfying the judgments, there should be any balance, they will share in the same jointly, and the reimbursement must be made before the creditors of the other redeeming creditor can receive anything. Withers v. Pemberton, 43 Tenn. 56, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1866); Pearl v. Pearl, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 206 (1873); Brown v. Bigley, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 618 (1878).

       Where a judgment debtor dies after the sale of his land for the payment of another judgment, it is not necessary for the judgment creditor to revive his judgment against the heirs, in order to be entitled to redeem the land from the purchaser. Bledsoe v. McCorry, 68 Tenn. 320, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1878); Puckett v. Richardson, 74 Tenn. 49, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 210 (1880); Hudson v. Conway, 77 Tenn. 410, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       A creditor by debt acknowledged by deed need not, after the debtor's death, obtain judgment against the personal representative, and take other proceeding by scire facias, or otherwise, against the heirs, to entitle him to redeem the debtor's land sold subject to redemption.

       The redeeming creditor, after paying the money to the purchaser or holder of the land, must, by some positive act, give the debtor the required credit. The statute does not prescribe any mode in which the credit must be given to the debtor. Section <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c08s66-8-107" target="_self">66-8-107</a></cite> prescribed the mode of giving the credit, where the purchaser advances his own bid, but this provision is not held to be applicable in redemption by a creditor, for the question is reserved. However, it is stated that the mode, prescribed in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c08s66-8-107" target="_self">66-8-107</a></cite> should be adopted and pursued by the redeeming creditor, as the safer course. Hill v. Walker, 46 Tenn. 424, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1869); Hurt v. Brien, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 443 (1873); Burton v. Robinson, 68 Tenn. 364, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The receipt of a redeeming creditor, purporting to give the judgment debtor the required credit, filed with the clerk, without personal or actual notice to the debtor, must contain on its face sufficient information to be operative to give him notice that the credit is given to him on certain judgments in the redemption of certain land, so as to enable him to redeem the land, otherwise the redemption will not be operative against the debtor, and recoveries in ejectment against such debtor's tenants will be set aside, and the title divested out of such redeeming creditor and vested in the debtor, and such redeeming creditor will be accountable for rents, but will be entitled to credit for the redemption money so paid, with interest, and costs. Instances of receipts held to be void. Hurt v. Brien, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 443 (1873).

       A judgment creditor, who has purchased or redeemed his debtor's lands and who has taken the sheriff's deed therefor, but who has not advanced his bid within the time and upon the terms prescribed, cannot hold the land against his debtor, or the assignee of his debtor's right of redemption, upon payment or tender of the amount of his bid, with interest and costs, because of unsatisfied judgments held by him against the redeeming debtor or his assignee, but he will be compelled to submit to the redemption, and will not be permitted, after such tender, to withhold the legal title from the debtor or his assignee, as security for other unsatisfied judgments he may hold against the debtor or his assignee. Ewing v. Cook, 85 Tenn. 332, 3 S.W. 507, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 50, 4 Am. St. Rep. 765 (1886); Rogers v. Tindall, 99 Tenn. 356, 42 S.W. 86, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1897).

       Where the redeeming creditor acquires no title to the land, for the reason that the purchaser acquired no title, because the judgment upon which the execution issued was previously extinguished by payment, he may recover the redemption money from such purchaser, especially where he was the plaintiff in the judgment. Keeling v. Heard, 40 Tenn. 592, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 175 (1859); Edwards v. Ervin, 2 Shan. 510 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the purchaser acquired no title, for the reason that the judgment of condemnation, though pronounced, was not entered of record, but was omitted from the entry of the justice's papers on the minutes, and not on account of the judgment debtor's defective or imperfect title to the land, a creditor who is induced to redeem upon the misrepresentations of such party that the proceedings were regular, may recover the redemption money so paid by him, and he is not barred of a recovery by the rule of caveat emptor. Neal v. Read, 66 Tenn. 333, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 138 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a sale of separate and distinct lots, or parcels of land, in gross for an aggregate sum, be considered as absolutely void or only voidable by the debtor, his creditors cannot safely redeem the land, because they cannot assume that the debtor may not afterwards elect to treat the sale as void, and thus defeat their title. Mount, Hall & Co. v. Hall & Hall, 3 Shan. 568 (1875); Cooke, Settle & Co. v. Walters, 70 Tenn. 116, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 193 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule of caveat emptor applying to purchasers at execution sales of lands applies to the redemption made by a creditor, and the last redeeming creditor has no right to recover the money paid by him, whether there was failure of title because there was no title in the debtor, or because the proceedings were so defective as not to pass his title, where there were valid and subsisting judgments upon which the sales and previous redemptions were based, and where there was no fraud or misrepresentation. Edwards v. Ervin, 2 Shan. 510 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the title has failed, the last redeeming creditor is entitled to have the satisfaction of his own judgment against the debtor set aside, as well as the judgment upon which the original sale was made, and the judgments of all previously redeeming creditors against the common debtor whose supposed land was so attempted to be sold and redeemed, and to have the judgments revived for his benefit. Edwards v. Ervin, 2 Shan. 510 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a necessary condition of the right to redeem there must be a sale at which the purchaser took title and the redemptioners take through him. Cannon Mills, Inc. v. Spivey, 208 Tenn. 419, 346 S.W.2d 266, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1961).

       The creditor, for the payment of whose debt the debtor's land was sold, cannot enforce a redemption from the purchaser who became such at his solicitation, and under a promise from him not to redeem the land, and who, by such promise, repeated after the purchase, was induced to expend considerable sums in improvements.

       A purchasing or redeeming creditor has a continuous right during the whole 20 days in which to advance his bid, and he cannot be forced to do so at an earlier day, by another creditor proposing to redeem the land from him. If another creditor makes a tender in redemption within the 20 days, his action would be rendered nugatory by a subsequent advance made within the 20 days. The right of advancement is continuous during the 20 days, whether exclusive or not, and, if made within that time, displaces and annuls any tender made by another creditor, whatever may be the rights of other creditors acquired by tenders during that period.

The waiver of the right of redemption in such deed of trust was effective only upon a sale lawfully made, and was not barred by the trustee's sale, made after the refusal of a proper tender to the secured creditor, and, upon a redemption enforced in chancery at the suit of the debtor's heirs and administrator, the purchaser under the deed of trust, though a third person, will be compelled to account for the rents accruing while the land was in his possession, to be credited on the secured debt, the payment of the amount of which complainants were required to make as a condition of vesting the title in them.

Hunt v. Liles, 35 Tenn. App. 173, 243 S.W.2d 149, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 132 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).

       The statute is imperative that the debtor's payment or tender in redemption must be made within the prescribed time, otherwise he forfeits the benefit provided for him, and the title of the purchaser becomes absolute, and this is so, even where the annual rental value of the land is greater than the amount required for redemption, especially where the debtor stands by and takes no active step to enforce his right until after expiration of the redemption period.

       In the absence of a contract, express or implied, and for a stronger reason, where the debtor disclaims or repudiates the purchaser's title, the latter cannot maintain an action against the former for the recovery of rents until he recovers the possession of the land by ejectment, when he may sue for mesne profits.

       A bill to enforce redemption was properly dismissed where it was based upon the fact that the debtor went to the house of the purchaser, with the redemption money, for the purpose of exercising the right of redemption, three days before the expiration of the redemption period, and again the day before the expiration of such period, the purchaser being casually absent on both occasions, but somewhere in the neighborhood and in the county, and without any fraudulent purpose to defeat the redemption, and no further effort was made to redeem the land. The redemption money should have been paid to the clerk. Rothwell v. Gettys, 30 Tenn. 135, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the purchaser of land sold under an execution resides out of the county in which the land lies, a judgment creditor of the debtor whose land was sold may pay the redemption money to the clerk, and, upon doing so within the time prescribed by law and depositing a receipt as required by law for the requisite credit on the judgment, the redemption may be effected. Anderson, Green & Co. v. Ryan & Co., 69 Tenn. 658, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 151 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The debtor whose land has been sold may always make certain his redemption by paying the redemption money to the clerk of the court under judgment or decree of which the land was sold, and, in other cases, to the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the land lies, and, in this way, the peril of deciding an actual or possible controversy between the purchaser and a claimant under him by transfer or otherwise as to which is entitled to the redemption money may be avoided, although the redemption money may in all cases be paid to the purchaser or to the rightful claimant under him, but this is done at the peril of the party attempting to redeem, and, if he should pay the money to the wrong party, the redemption would not be made effective. Hitt v. Caney Fork Gulf Coal Co., 124 Tenn. 334, 139 S.W. 693, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1911).

       The clerk of a court cannot receive anything but money in redemption of land, and his receipt of a check on a bank for the required amount, marked “good,” though received as money, but not paid was not sufficient to authorize a redemption. Lytle v. Etherly, 18 Tenn. 389, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1837); Farnsworth v. Howard, 41 Tenn. 215, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1860).

        The general assembly finds that the use of solar energy can help reduce reliance on depletable energy resources such as oil, natural gas and coal, and that solar energy development should, therefore, be encouraged. Further, that as the use of solar energy systems increases, the possibility of future shading of such systems by buildings or vegetation will also increase. Therefore, the general assembly declares that solar easements may be established to allow the owner of a solar energy system to negotiate for assurance of continued access to sunlight. The general assembly further finds that encouragement and protection of solar energy systems is a valid objective which counties and municipalities may consider in promulgating zoning regulations.

       This section was enacted to provide for those cases where no acceleration option had been given by the contract, a situation formerly quite common when purchase money was secured by vendor's liens, as distinguished from the more modern use of securing the debt by mortgage in trust deed form. Lawman v. Barnett, 180 Tenn. 546, 177 S.W.2d 121, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 321, <cite class="alr">153 A.L.R. 772</cite> (1944).

       The statute does not apply where the vendor has negotiated some of several notes which are outstanding. Green v. Jarvis, 42 S.W. 165, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 36 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute by its terms is limited to vendor's liens and does not include mortgages and trust deeds. Lawman v. Barnett, 180 Tenn. 546, 177 S.W.2d 121, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 321, <cite class="alr">153 A.L.R. 772</cite> (1944).

       It is the general rule that all parties having an equitable or legal right in the subject of litigation should be made parties, and it is directly held that this rule applies to suits to enforce the vendor's lien. Steele v. Satterfield, 148 Tenn. 649, 257 S.W. 413, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       While subsequent purchasers are not always necessary parties to a suit by a vendor to enforce the vendor's express lien, it is always necessary to make them parties defendant, if they are to be bound by the decree, so as to authorize a writ of possession to issue against them where they have gone into possession before the commencement of the suit. Steele v. Satterfield, 148 Tenn. 649, 257 S.W. 413, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1923).

       A vendor who contracts to execute a deed for land, after payment by the vendee of the notes, given for the purchase price, is not required to tender a deed before or in suit brought to enforce his vendor's lien and collect the notes.

       It was error to sell all of a tract of 135 acres for the satisfaction of one of a series of notes, which one, alone, was due, where it did not appear that the land could not be divided without material injury, nor that the vendee had so directed.

       Where there has been default at date of maturity on two of three notes for purchase price of land, and the third has become payable under right of holder to declare it due and payable because of default on the previous notes, the entire debt is due and payable, and the vendor's lien is enforceable on the entire tract.

       An order of sale is not vitiated because the exact amount has not been ascertained, if the amount can be arrived at from mathematical calculation; such as the calculation of interest on a note which is set out in the decree. Tomkins v. Roscoe, 2 Shan. 255 (1877).

       A decree for sale of land for enforcement of vendor's lien may be rendered without any formal personal recovery for amount due, where it recites and adjudges the amount due on the notes given for the purchase price, and orders the land to be sold, if this ascertained sum is not paid within a specified time.

       The trust deed providing for a sale for satisfaction of installments of a mortgage debt that are mature at the time, in a court foreclosure of its lien, will be decreed for the satisfaction of only matured installments, subject to continuing lien for subsequent installments. Alleged prejudicial effect of so selling in that purchasers would be slow to bid on the property at the first sale, cannot affect the rule. Fox v. River Heights, Inc., 22 Tenn.

       Where in a cause for the foreclosure of a mortgage lien, there is a retention of jurisdiction to decree as to defaults on nonmatured installment notes, the chancery court was authorized to decree and confirm a sale for installments which subsequently became delinquent without any filing of an amended or supplemental bill praying therefor.

        The mechanics' and materialmen's lien statute is to be construed liberally in favor of employees. First Nat'l Bank v. Prairie Corp., 547 F. Supp. 14, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14720 (E.D. Tenn. 1982).

       <p>
        If the supplier fails to comply with the requirements of title 66, ch. 11, the supplier has no materialmen's lien against the owner's property; it is impermissible to circumvent these sections by allowing recovery against the “principal” under an agency theory upon showing only that the contractor had authority to purchase materials, although not on credit. Edmond Bros. Supply Co. v. Boyle & Adams, 44 S.W.3d 530, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 737 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2001).

Durkan Patterned Carpet, Inc. v. Premier Hotel Dev. Group (In re Premier Hotel Dev. Group), 270 B.R. 234, 2001 Bankr. LEXIS 1576 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 2001).

        From the use of the words “in direct privity of contract” in one section of the statute and “in contractual privity” in another section, it is fair to assume the legislature did not intend the two phrases to have the same meaning. Diaz Constr. v. Indus. Dev. Bd. of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2015).

        This section contemplates that the delivery of materials giving rise to a furnisher's lien may be made to a contractor or subcontractor at a place other than the site of the improvement, if delivery is made with the intent that the materials will be later delivered without intermingling by the contractor or subcontractor to the job, and if they are later so delivered and used on the improvement.

        Where a race-car simulator was installed by plaintiff construction company as part of improvements it made to defendant's commercial property, plaintiff filed a notice of mechanic's lien against the property owner under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c11s66-11-101" target="_self">66-11-101</a></cite>, et seq. in the amount of $ 70,583 for labor and/or material furnished to the leasehold; the trial court erred by awarding plaintiff a judgment against the simulator to satisfy its mechanic's lien. A secured party properly filed a financing statement and perfected its security interest in the simulator prior to the attachment of plaintiff's interest as a lien creditor. Metro Constr. Co., LLC v.

        A road is neither a building, structure, erection, alteration, demolition, or excavation; therefore, complainant is not entitled to a lien upon the land of defendants for construction of a road leading to the residence of the defendants, the road not being an “improvement.” Britt v.

        Where there was no evidence that lumber was delivered by the supplier to the job site, that it was ever used in fabrication of window panels delivered to the job site or that it was specially selected and prepared for the job, there was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could satisfy a reasonable mind that the lumber was incorporated into the improvement, and thus the supplier had no lien against the property.

        The rule is that the statute must be strictly construed as to the parties who are entitled to the mechanic's lien, and the existence of the lien must be clearly established by proof of the facts necessary to constitute the lien, but when the existence of the lien is determined, and the party claiming the same is determined to be entitled to it, the statute will be liberally construed as regards the subject matter to which the lien should attach, and as to the remedy for its enforcement.

        Where the lessor by agreement allowed the lessee to make certain improvements on the leased premises, and agreed to contribute a certain sum towards the costs thereof, and accordingly paid the sum, the contractor making the improvements, under a contract with the lessee alone, has no lien upon the property of the lessor as the owner of the fee.

        Where lessee of real property was free to select the contractor, make change orders without consulting lessors, and deal independently with the contractor, the lessor did not maintain sufficient control over the lessee's actions to establish an agency relationship which would enable the contractor to claim a lien on lessor's property for the unpaid balance due on the work.

        Under a revised version of the lien statutes, a contractor's lien took “effect from the time of the visible commencement of operations,” which was in February 2007. Under either version of the statute, given that the date of visible commencement of operations was prior to a lender's recording of its Deed of Trust, the lender would have been aware that another party's lien could take priority over its Deed of Trust, and its substantive rights were not impaired by the liberal application of the amended lien statutes.

        The mechanic's lien binds the land as a proceeding in rem, as against the owner's subsequent conveyance or other disposition of it, and as against subsequent adverse proceedings by attachment or otherwise. Furguson v. Ellis, 25 Tenn. 268, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1845); Weller &amp; Bell v. McNabb, 36 Tenn. 422, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1857); Burr v. Graves, 72 Tenn. 552, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 63 (1880); Green v.

        A sale by owner of the property does not prevent enforcement by suit of lienor if commenced within the year allowed. Furguson v. Ellis, 25 Tenn. 268, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1845).

Furguson v. Ellis, 25 Tenn. 268, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1845). See Weller & Bell v. McNabb, 36 Tenn. 422, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1857).

        Pursuant to one article of the architect agreement, the architectural firm was permitted to proceed in accordance with the law to comply with lien notice or filing deadlines, and the applicable law allowed the firm to bring a lien enforcement action up to one year after the improvement was complete; the notice of completion stated the date of October 21, 2008, and the firm filed suit within the one-year statute of limitations, such that the suit was timely.

       <p>
        Where the contract is entire, the statute of limitation begins to run against the lien when the building is substantially finished, and is treated by all the parties as completed, though something unimportant, or not of the essence of the contract may remain undone. Luter & Daniel v. Cobb, 41 Tenn. 525, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 100 (1860).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case of materialman, the time for acquiring the lien by filing notice begins to run from the delivery of the last materials. Bristol-Goodson Elec. Light & Power Co. v. Bristol Gas, Elec. Light & Power Co., 99 Tenn. 371, 42 S.W. 19, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1897); Voightman & Co. v. Southern R. Co., 123 Tenn. 452, 131 S.W. 982, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1910).

       <p>
        Where a materialman furnishes material, part of which the owner's inspector, after the delivery thereof, rejected as defective, the fact that the materialman thereafter furnished additional materials to be used in the place of the alleged defective materials, and so used, did not extend the time for his acquiring a lien for his materials previously furnished under the original contract, but the time for acquiring such lien began to run from the delivery of the last material under the original contract. Voightman & Co. v. Southern R. Co., 123 Tenn. 452, 131 S.W. 982, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1910).

        The lien is lost if the lienor fails to cause the attachment to be issued and levied within one year after the accrual of his right, and the mere commencement of suit in time, followed by the issuance and levy of the attachment after the expiration of one year will not preserve the lien. Ragon v. Howard, 97 Tenn. 334, 37 S.W. 136, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 148 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is sufficient to prevent loss of mechanic's lien if the bill against the owner is filed and the attachment is levied within the year, and other parties, without the issuance of another attachment, may be thereafter brought in by an amended and supplemental bill to test priorities.

        A bona fide purchaser of land may successfully contest the claim of a creditor of the vendor, by virtue of a mechanic's lien fixed by attachment and judgment before a justice of the peace (now general session judge), by showing that the lien debt had been paid before the sale and judgment, and that the lien was lost by a failure to register the judgment as required by a statute then in force.

        Where claims of furnishers of labor and materials exceeded the contract price and some furnishers of labor and materials had been paid in full, but others had not, the formula to be used to determine the pro rata share of each lien claimant is to divide the total contract price by the total lienable claims, both paid and unpaid, for material and labor used in constructing the improvement in accordance with the original contract, and the percentage thus determined is applied to each outstanding claim.

        No particular form of written notice is prescribed by the statute, it only being provided that the mortgagee have written notice of the same before the work is begun and consent thereto. Neely v. Clarence Saunders Co., 169 Tenn. 30, 81 S.W.2d 390, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1935).

        Where mortgagee registered trust deed notes payable to bearer and before maturity negotiated notes to bank as collateral for preexisting indebtedness, notice to mortgagee of contract executed between mortgagor and holder of mechanic's lien for labor performed on real estate secured by notes was not notice to bank as a holder in due course, and holder of mechanic's lien was not entitled to priority over bank. Neely v. Clarence Saunders Co., 169 Tenn. 30, 81 S.W.2d 390, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1935).

        A mortgagee who sees a written contract between mortgagor and lien holder has “written notice” of the contract. Neely v. Clarence Saunders Co., 169 Tenn. 30, 81 S.W.2d 390, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1935).

       <p>
        The mechanic's lien is inferior to that of a mortgage where the materials for which the lien is asserted were furnished after the registration of the mortgage and without notice to the mortgagee, though upon a contract with the mortgagor, made prior to the mortgage. Rawlings v. New Memphis Gaslight Co., 105 Tenn. 268, 60 S.W. 206, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 76, 80 Am. St. Rep. 880 (1900). See Reid v. Bank of Tennessee, 33 Tenn. 262, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1853); Pride v.

        Where a college sold a lot and agreed to lend money for the construction of a building thereon, and the lot was actually conveyed and a trust deed executed by the grantee and registered, the lien of the college under the trust deed was superior to the lien of materialmen subsequently furnishing materials, although a contract was entered into between the purchaser and the college for the construction of the building, such contract being entered into in order to obtain a bond to protect the college. Kingsport Brick Corp. v. Bostwick, 145 Tenn. 19, 235 S.W. 70, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mechanic's lien is subordinate to that of a mortgagee, if the lien of the mortgagee is of record prior to the time the mechanic's lien attaches, unless the mortgagee has written notice of the contract with the mortgagor before the work is begun and the materials furnished and consents thereto. Kingsport Brick Corp. v. Bostwick, 145 Tenn. 19, 235 S.W. 70, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1921). See Parker-Harris Co. v. Tate, 135 Tenn. 509, 188 S.W. 54, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 44, 1916F L.R.A.

        A lien for materials furnished is superior to the lien of a mortgage registered after the delivery of the materials was commenced under a contract with the owner. Bristol-Goodson Elec. Light & Power Co. v. Bristol Gas, Elec. Light & Power Co., 99 Tenn. 371, 42 S.W. 19, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1897); Thomas v. Setliffe, 160 Tenn. 689, 28 S.W.2d 344, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        An original vendor's lien was retained, in registered deed, against the owner. Thereafter a trust deed was taken to secure the purchase money, but, before it was registered, materials for improvement of the property were furnished the owner. The furnisher's lien had priority over trust deed and purchaser thereunder. Thomas v. Setliffe, 160 Tenn. 689, 28 S.W.2d 344, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the furnisher began furnishing materials before the execution and recordation of the mortgage, nothing further appearing, the furnisher has the superior lien. McDonnell v. Amo, 162 Tenn. 36, 34 S.W.2d 212, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1931).

        A mortgagee who is a party defendant to a suit for the enforcement of a mechanic's lien, and whose mortgage is subordinated to the mechanic's lien, may contest, on appeal, the existence and regularity of the mechanic's lien, although the owner and mortgagor, by failing to appeal, has waived any right to complain, so far as he is concerned.

        A furnisher taking machinery in payment, loses his priority over a mortgagee thereafter advancing money, even though the title to the machinery fails, and it is replevined by its legal owner. Garrett v. Adams, 39 S.W. 730, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 6 (Tenn. Ch. App. Mar. 1, 1897).

       <p>
        In determining the priority of lien of a party lending money under a deed of trust and that of materialmen, it was wholly immaterial whether the party lending the money had advanced the entire amount at the time the material was furnished, if the obligation to advance the money existed. Kingsport Brick Corp. v. Bostwick, 145 Tenn. 19, 235 S.W. 70, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1921).

        The lien is paramount to attorney's lien for fees, where the owner of land, after the lien had attached thereto, made a general assignment of all his property for the benefit of his creditors, and thereafter a bill was filed by the assignee, for the purpose of selling the property and adjusting liens and claims of creditors, and contesting the lienor's claim, which the lienor, through his own counsel, successfully asserted over the assignee's resistance. Steger v. Arctic Refrigerating Co., 89 Tenn. 453, 14 S.W. 1087, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 70, <cite class="lra">11 L.R.A. 580</cite> (Tenn. Dec. 1890).

        Where a mechanic furnishes materials under a contract made with the owner who has only a bond for title from his vendor upon payment of the purchase money still unpaid, such mechanic is only entitled to enforce his lien against the vendee's equity, unless the vendor has waived his lien by acts and declarations.

        The mechanic's lien is superior to the vendor's lien, where, as an inducement to the sale and conveyance of the land, the vendor stipulated that certain buildings and improvements should be erected thereon by the vendee, according to certain plans and specifications, and at a fixed minimum price, and agreed to advance and lend a certain sum to the vendee for this purpose, the last instalment of which was not to be paid until the land was cleared of all liens other than the vendor's lien, and where the mechanic's lien was created in making the stipulated improvements.

       Where the lienor's contract is in writing, and has been acknowledged, or in lieu of acknowledgment is sworn to by the prime contractor as to its execution by the owner, it may be recorded in the lien book in the register of deeds of the county where the real property, or any part of the affected real property, lies. Subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers for value shall be deemed to have notice of the lien so long as the recorded contract sets forth the contract price and describes the real property with reasonable certainty.

        In order to preserve the priority of the lien provided by this chapter as of the date of its attachment, as concerns subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers for a valuable consideration without notice of the lien, though not as concerns the owner, the lienor, who has not recorded the lienor's contract pursuant to § 66-11-111, is required to record in the office of the register of deeds of the county where the real property, or any part affected, lies, a sworn statement of the amount for, and a reasonably certain description of the real property on, which the lien is claimed. The recording party shall pay filing fees, and shall be provided a receipt for the filing fees, which amount shall be part of the lien amount. Recordation is required to be done no later than ninety (90) days after the date the improvement is complete or is abandoned, prior to which time the lien shall be effective as against the purchasers or encumbrancers without the recordation. The owner shall serve thirty (30) days' notice on prime contractors and on all of those lienors who have served notice in accordance with § 66-11-145 prior to the owner's transfer of any interest to a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer for a valuable consideration. If the sworn statement is not recorded within that time, the lien's priority as to subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers shall be determined as if it attached as of the time the sworn statement is recorded.

        Subsequent trivial repairs, made after the completion of the building, such as stopping a leak in the roof, will not arrest the running of the statute of limitation. Dunn v. McKee, 37 Tenn. 657, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 89 (1858); Luter & Daniel v. Cobb, 41 Tenn. 525, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 100 (1860).

        Mere trivial imperfections, requiring corrective adjustments do not prevent a construction project from being substantially complete for lien purposes, and the correction of such imperfections is not a furnishing of labor or materials for which a charge may be made or a lien claimed.

       <p>
        In action by owner, seeking to bring in all lien claimants, and to pay them pro rata because the amount of outstanding claims exceeded the contract price, the burden was on plaintiff to show the contract price and that after paying all other valid liens on the property, there was not enough of the contract price remaining to satisfy the claim of the particular defendant.

        The right to enforce a mechanic's lien is a statutory right. Jordan v. Deitz, 201 Tenn. 77, 296 S.W.2d 866, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 468 (1956), superseded by statute as stated in, Paschall's, Inc. v. Dozier, 219 Tenn. 45, 407 S.W.2d 150, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 505 (1966).

LEXIS 468 (1956)) so that in a suit to enforce a mechanic's lien by one who is not in privity of contract with the landowner, the contractor is no longer a necessary and indispensable party to the suit.

         4. Procedure before Lower Court.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        No form of procedure for enforcing the lien, before justices of the peace (now general sessions courts), is prescribed by statute, and the proceedings must be according to the course of the common law, as near as possible. There must be a suit brought by the party seeking to enforce the lien, and an attachment sued out against the property, upon which the lien is claimed, simultaneously with the issuance of the warrant. Warner v. A.H. Yates & Co., 118 Tenn. 548, 102 S.W. 92, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (Tenn. Apr. 1907).

        The provision in this section authorizing the owner who has been compelled to pay the subcontractors, mechanics, or materialmen in discharge of their liens on the property, to take judgment over by motion against the contractor upon his indemnity bond, does not render the statute unconstitutional, for it does not subject the contractor to liability without his day in court, because notice is required by necessary implication.

        Mechanic's lien laws are not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that they create liens that may take precedence over the rights of others that would otherwise prevail. Cole Mfg. Co. v.

        It is common knowledge to all lawyers that over a period of years, and especially during a building boom, there are hardly enough precautions that can be taken by the lender of money or the property owner to protect himself against improper application of funds paid in certain instances to certain unscrupulous contractors or those doing business on a shoe string. It was probably by reason of this fact that this section was adopted by the general assembly at the instance of the reputable contractors and others of the state. State v.

        A statute of this nature is intended to make the payments to the contractor trust funds for payment of labor and materials and to afford protection against contractors who receive money for construction or repair of buildings and divert it to other uses prior to payment of claims for labor, materials or other charges in connection with the work on the building.

        Although the classic misapplication of contract payments undoubtedly occurs when the owner of real property pays money to a contractor for improvement of the payor's property, the language of this section does not restrict application of the statute to owner-payors. State v. Patterson, 755 S.W.2d 815, 1984 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 2848 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section makes the misapplication of construction funds a criminal offense; it does not create an express or technical trust for purposes of establishing a fiduciary relationship or obligation within the meaning of 11 U.S.C.A. § 523(a)(4).

       </h4>
       <p>
        The gist of the offense charged under this statute is that a person exercising a contractual relation shall obtain funds for a specific purpose and shall divert those funds to his own use, leaving outstanding obligations for which a creditor would have a lien upon the property owned by the payor of such funds. This very closely approaches embezzlement. State v. Overton, 193 Tenn. 171, 245 S.W.2d 188, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1951); Daugherty v. State, 216 Tenn. 666, 393 S.W.2d 739, 1965 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not divide the offense created into degrees depending upon the amount misappropriated by the party charged. It makes him guilty of a felony irrespective of the amount so misappropriated. State v. Overton, 193 Tenn. 171, 245 S.W.2d 188, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 343 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, at time contractor received funds from real estate owner, there were amounts of money for which he was liable for materials furnished in performance of the contract, it was a violation of this section for him to retain a portion of such funds for labor performed by himself under the contract. Miller v. State, 206 Tenn. 103, 332 S.W.2d 179, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 348 (1960).

        Although payment made by contractor to supplier was first applied, on instructions from the contractor, to the account for defendant's house, where the funds from which the contractor made such payment where the proceeds from a loan received on another lot it was not improper for the contractor to request and the supplier to transfer such credit from defendant's account to the account for the lot on which the loan was secured.

       </p>

        While several states have statutes explicitly making funds paid to a contractor a trust for the benefit of laborers and materialmen, Tennessee only has this section which imposes criminal liability for misapplication of contract payments before debts to subcontractors have been satisfied. Sequatchie Concrete Service, Inc. v. Cutter Laboratories, 616 S.W.2d 162, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 424 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prevent construction payments from becoming part of a bankrupt contractor's property in the absence of a state builders trust fund statute, courts generally will set up either an equitable lien or a constructive trust for subcontractors who possess valid mechanics liens or inchoate liens that are still capable of becoming valid within the prescribed state statutory time limits and requirements. Sequatchie Concrete Service, Inc. v. Cutter Laboratories, 616 S.W.2d 162, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 424 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constructive trusts will be established to ensure that direct payments from the landowner to the materialmen or laborers either pursuant to a prior agreement or in exchange for an agreement not to file a lien are not held to be voidable preferences under the federal bankruptcy act. Sequatchie Concrete Service, Inc. v. Cutter Laboratories, 616 S.W.2d 162, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 424 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).

        The fact that a bankrupt contractor's eligibility for pretrial diversion was at one time apparently contingent upon his restitution for an obligation from which he had been discharged in bankruptcy does not establish a prima facie case of bad faith on the part of the prosecution in attempting to prosecute the contractor under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c11s66-11-138" target="_self">66-11-138</a></cite> for misapplication of contract payments.

Were any trust deemed created under the statute, such a trust would clearly be only a trust ex maleficio, arising only upon occurrence of the unlawful act of misapplication. This statute does not create an express or technical trust necessary to establish a fiduciary relationship within the contemplation of <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 523(a)</cite>(4) (1979).

        In dispute between internal revenue service and material supplier to debtor over rights in balance due under a construction contract, because Tennessee law does not impose a trust on construction funds for the benefit of mechanic or material lienors, contractor's subcontract with debtor did not include a retainage provision, and supplier had no contract with contractor who hired debtor, IRS's lien attached to the balance due the debtor. Therefore, the funds were not excludable from the bankruptcy estate. Hayes v. First Am. Nat'l Bank (In re Serv. Corp. of Am.), 115 B.R. 602, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 1332 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1990).

        Debtors (contractors) violated the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by representing that a county impact fee was required and by accepting payment from the creditors for an unnecessary fee that debtors never paid.

        T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c11s66-11-139" target="_self">66-11-139</a></cite> only applies to the lienor's claim for a lien and not to the claim for the debt. Where the statute says no “recovery may be allowed thereon, in the discretion of the court” it refers back to the beginning of the section to “any action to enforce the lien.” Dotson v. Gaidos, 736 S.W.2d 119, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2801 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).

        Contractor did not willfully and grossly exaggerate the contractor's lien claim because, (1) at trial, the contractor's motion to reduce the claim was granted, and (2) a project owner showed no resulting harm.

        This section provides that the mere use alone of proceeds by a contractor for any purpose other than payment of labor and materials on the project constitutes prima facie evidence of intent to defraud; to the extent that this statutory presumption conflicts with federal law, it cannot be considered in the context of determining dischargeability in bankruptcy.

        Although T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c11s66-11-140" target="_self">66-11-140</a></cite> created a prima facie case of intent to defraud where debtors (contractors) used creditors'  retainer to pay other bills and personal expenses, that did not suffice for a finding of nondischargeability under the Bankruptcy Code. However, facts that supported a finding of a false representation or false pretenses by debtors also supported a finding of fraudulent intent, as debtor wife knew when she reassured creditors that the retainer would be set up in house for the creditors'  project that her statement was not true because they never did business that way. Poole v. Batson (In re Batson), 568 B.R. 281, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 549 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. Feb. 28, 2017).

        Subcontractor was denied damages because the evidence did not preponderate against the finding that the general contractor did not intend to defraud the subcontractor as the balance of the general contractor's operating account, following fund transfers, exceeded the amount of any payment that was allegedly owed to the subcontractor during the vast majority of the life of the subcontract.

        Even if a supplier does not have actual knowledge of the source of funds offered as payment by a contractor, the supplier may still be required to properly allocate the payments if it has knowledge of facts from which it reasonably should know the source.

       <p>
        When a contractor uses progress payments to pay his supplier, whom he owes for other materials as well as for materials used on the job generating those payments, then those payments must be applied to the debts for materials used on that job, because the contractor owes a duty to the owner to pay that debt. The result does not depend on whether the supplier knew or had reason to know the source of the money used as payment. Alside Supply Center v. Vinson, 802 S.W.2d 632, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 682 (Tenn.

        Subcontractor's lien notices were sufficient, as required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c11s66-11-145" target="_self">66-11-145</a></cite>, because a home builder was both the owner and general contractor of a project. Williamson County Ready Mix, Inc. v. Pulte Homes Tenn. Ltd. P'ship, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 800 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a project owner, a prime contractor, remote contractors, and an employer in a subcontractor's action to enforce a mechanic's lien because subsection (a) required the subcontract to notify both the owner and the prime contractor of the project of nonpayment; as the entity in charge of the overall project, the prime contractor had to be given the opportunity to resolve the subcontractor's claim of nonpayment by the employer. Diaz Constr. v. Indus. Dev. Bd. of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subcontractor did not substantially comply with the notice requirements because it failed to notify the prime contractor of its claim; notification of the proper parties goes right to the heart of the purpose of the statute, which is to give the owner and prime contractor an opportunity to resolve payment issues in a timely fashion. Diaz Constr. v. Indus. Dev. Bd. of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2015).

       <p>
        Only reasonable interpretation of the statute is that the legislature intended remote contractors to give notice to the prime contractor upstream from them. Diaz Constr. v. Indus. Dev. Bd. of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        From the use of the words “in direct privity of contract” in one section of the statute and “in contractual privity” in another section, it is fair to assume the legislature did not intend the two phrases to have the same meaning. Diaz Constr. v. Indus. Dev. Bd. of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2015).

       Where one is employed by the landowner as his agent and manager of his farm, for a stipulated annual salary, such agent and manager has a lien on the crops produced and in his possession for the payment of his salary, without any contract therefor; and where there is a written contract giving such lien, it need not be registered.

       A contract by a laborer with a landowner to farm on the shares does not create a partnership, but they are tenants in common and each may sell or mortgage his respective interest. Mann v.

       An agreement, on the part of one who is to do the labor, to manage the land of another on shares, is not a lease, but a contract for the payment of services rendered, by a part of the crop raised. Mann v. Taylor, 52 Tenn. 267, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 261 (1871).

       An agreement to give a part of the crop, in consideration of the labor of tillage, is as much a hiring as an undertaking to pay in money. McCutchin v. Taylor, 79 Tenn. 259, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1883).

       Under a contract by which it was agreed that the landlord should furnish the tenant his supplies, and should retain possession and control of the crop, and sell it, and should pay one half of the proceeds to the tenant, after paying himself, for the supplies furnished, the rights of the tenant's mortgagee, even without notice of the terms of the contract, must be postponed to those of the landlord under the contract. This was not a lien created, but was a part of the contract determining the rights of the parties. Meacham v. Herndon, 86 Tenn. 366, 6 S.W. 741, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1887).

       At common law, innkeepers had a lien upon the baggage brought upon the premises by guests, whether it belonged to the guests or third persons, where they had no notice or knowledge of adverse ownership; but such lien did not exist in favor of boardinghouse keepers. Nance v. O. K. Houck Piano Co., 128 Tenn. 1, 155 S.W. 1172, 1914D Am. Ann. Cas. 834, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1913).

       The lien of a boardinghouse keeper on a piano brought into her house and held by the boarder under a conditional sale, in which the vendor retained the title to secure the purchase price, is superior to that of such vendor, where the boardinghouse keeper had no notice or knowledge of such rights of such vendor.

       Whether unlicensed keepers of hotels, boardinghouses, and lodginghouses can enforce the lien, where a subsequent revenue statute declares such business a privilege, and taxes it, and forbids its pursuit without license and payment of the tax, is questionable.

        Statutory lien of mechanic who repaired automobile on order of conditional vendee was inferior to right of conditional vendor since the mere fact that automobile is in need of repairs did not subordinate the rights of conditional vendor in the automobile to the rights of the mechanic claiming under a statutory lien. Shaw v. Webb, 131 Tenn. 173, 174 S.W. 273, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 96, L.R.A. (n.s.) 1915D1141 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the conditional vendor had parted with possession, the placing of the automobile in the possession of the conditional purchaser should not be considered as a consent in advance to the subordination of the title retained for security for the payment of the purchase price. Such seller's intent, if any, to permit repairs and a consequent lien attaching to his interest should be manifested in the note contract. Shaw v. Webb, 131 Tenn. 173, 174 S.W. 273, 1914 Tenn.

       This lien is inferior to the lien created by registered mortgage, where the livery stable keeper subsequently keeps and feeds the horse, without actual knowledge of the mortgage, and before its maturity, under a contract made with the mortgagor in possession according to the terms of the mortgage, without the knowledge of the mortgagee that the horse is being so kept and fed.

      <p>
       The lien is not lost because the owner is permitted to use his horse temporarily, where it is well understood that the possession will in a short time be restored; and the lien is superior to the lien of an execution levied upon the horse while so temporarily in the owner's possession and use.

       The lienor offering to sell the horse to pay the lien debt will not be treated as guilty of a conversion, where it appears that the act of offering to sell was not in defiance of the owner's title, but only an irregular mode of attempting to enforce his lien.

       The lien on the offspring is superior to the right of a mortgagee to whom the female is conveyed, and whose mortgage is registered, before the young is dropped, for all persons must take notice of the lien at their peril.

       The ground of the attachment is the lien for the price of the season, and the allegation in the affidavit for the attachment that the offspring had been fraudulently conveyed to the defendant is merely an averment that the deed is void in law as against the plaintiff's preexisting lien, and the allegation, being unnecessary, may be treated as surplusage.

        A court of equity may enforce a statutory lien by attachment of property or otherwise impounding it, which is a proceeding quasi in rem, where the statute creating the lien provides no method of enforcing it.

        The method of enforcement of all statutory liens on personal property, where no method of enforcing the same is provided by the statute creating the lien, is by original attachment. Potter v. Foster, 16 Tenn. App. 336, 64 S.W.2d 520, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 9 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lienholder has no statutory lien on the proceeds from the sale of the lien-subject property, and the statute addresses only enforcement of a statutory lien; accordingly, the statute is not a statutory vehicle for the lienholder to reach the proceeds from the sale of the lien-subject property, and it neither provides for nor excludes other remedies that may be available to the lienholder to reach the proceeds from the sale of the lien-subject property. Embraer Aircraft Maint. Servs. v. AeroCentury Corp., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 729 (Tenn. Nov. 27, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute states only that a statutory lien on personal property, where the lien statute does not specify a method of enforcement, may be enforced by original attachment of the lien-subject property itself; it does not address how a creditor might reach the proceeds from the sale of the lien-subject property, and it does not indicate whether there are other remedies possibly available to the creditor who holds the statutory lien.

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Registration of a deed is prima facie evidence of its execution and delivery. Butterfeild v. Miller, 195 F. 200, 1912 U.S. App. LEXIS 1362 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1912).

        2. Subscribing Witnesses.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The words “subscribing witnesses,” used in this section, mean that the persons who witness a deed must either have seen the maker sign or heard him acknowledge his signature, and they must themselves sign as witnesses in the presence of the maker by his request or assent, or if they sign as witnesses in the absence of the maker they must have been specially requested by him to do so. Tate v. Lawrence, 58 Tenn. 503, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 294 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a deed was signed by the maker in the presence of two sons of the bargainee who were not asked to and did not witness it until after the death of the bargainee when they took the unacknowledged, unwitnessed deed to the county clerk's office where they put their names as witnesses to the deed and then proved its execution and had it registered, the registration was void. Tate v. Lawrence, 58 Tenn. 503, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 294 (1872).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The probate of a deed by one witness will not authorize its registration, and a certified copy of such deed so proved and registered is inadmissible in evidence. Batte v. Stone, 12 Tenn. 167, 12 Tenn. 168, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1833).
      </p>
      <p>
       Execution of deed was not established under this section where according to the certificate only one of the subscribing witnesses appeared before the clerk. Lamons v. Mathes, 33 Tenn. App. 609, 232 S.W.2d 558, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 119 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).

      </h4>
      <p>
       An instrument will not be considered legally registered unless it has been acknowledged by the maker or approved by two (2) subscribing witnesses; and where there are no subscribing witnesses, the validity of an attempted registration depends upon the validity of the notary's acknowledgment. Haynes v. State, 213 Tenn. 447, 374 S.W.2d 394, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1964).
      </p>

       An instrument will not be considered legally registered unless acknowledged by the maker or properly witnessed. Howard v. United States, 566 S.W.2d 521, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1978).
      </p>

United States, 566 S.W.2d 521, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1978); Copas v. Tidwell, 601 S.W.2d 708, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 470 (Tenn. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attempted registration of instrument creating restrictive covenants, which contained no acknowledgment whatsoever, was invalid. Patterson v. Cook, 655 S.W.2d 955, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 593 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of an acknowledgment is to authenticate an instrument so that it can be validly registered. In re Spears, 39 B.R. 91, 1984 B.R. LEXIS 5882 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. Apr. 13, 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deed of trust was improperly acknowledged, as the defect in the acknowledgement, the omission of the official notary seal from the acknowledgement certificate, was a fatal flaw rendering the instrument null and void as to subsequent creditors and bona fide purchasers. In re Crim v. EMC Mortg. Corp., 81 S.W.3d 764, 2002 Tenn. LEXIS 339 (Tenn. 2002).

       No special form for a will is required and no particular form of words need be used in making the request of witnesses to attest a will. Howell v. Brown, 7 Tenn. App. 380, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 56 (1928).

       Under this section and the requirement of the mechanic's lien statute that statement of amount due mechanic's lien claimant must be supported by affidavit, without which it will not be entitled to registration, claim of one filing statement, not entitled to be registered because not verified, will be denied. McDonnell v. Amo, 162 Tenn. 36, 34 S.W.2d 212, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1931).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Neither the wife of the grantor nor the wife of the grantee is a competent subscribing witness to the deed from or to her husband, because she may not be competent to testify in a suit between the parties concerning the same, for the subscribing witnesses must be competent to testify in a court of justice about the matter involved. The statute making husband and wife competent witnesses, except as to matter occurring between them by virtue of or in consequence of the marital relation, is self limiting upon its face to “civil actions in the courts,” and does not extend the competency to become a subscribing witness, and has no reference to subscribing witnesses to either deeds or wills, and their probate is not in the purview of the law and clearly not in the legislative mind. Third Nat'l Bank v. O'Brien, 94 Tenn. 38, 28 S.W. 293, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1894); Pope v. Merchants' Trust Co., 118 Tenn. 506, 103 S.W. 792, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1907).

       When the certificate is in proper form, its every statement is given great weight. Unsupported testimony of husband and wife cannot overturn notary's statement as to separate acknowledgment by wife. Erwin Nat'l Bank v. Riddle, 18 Tenn. App. 561, 79 S.W.2d 1032, 1934 Tenn.

       Deputy clerk, if legally appointed, even by parol, though not qualified, is an officer de facto; his official acts as such, so far as they affect the rights of third persons and the public, are as effectual and valid as if performed by an officer de jure. Atkinson v. Micheaux, 20 Tenn. 312, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1839); Farmers & Merchants' Bank v. Chester, 25 Tenn. 458, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1846); Bates v. Dyer, 28 Tenn. 162, 1848 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       County clerks, as well as the clerks of all other courts of this state, have authority and power to appoint deputies who are vested with all the powers and authority of the principal clerks, and whose acts are the acts of the principal clerks. Martin v. Porter, 51 Tenn. 407, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 182 (1871); Kelley v. Story, 53 Tenn. 202, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 345 (Tenn. Oct. 4, 1871); Harris v. State, 100 Tenn. 287, 45 S.W. 438, 1897 Tenn.

      <p>
       A certificate of acknowledgment to deeds, signed by the deputy clerk, without naming the principal, is good; and while an acknowledgment made before the deputy cannot be truthfully certified as having been made before the principal clerk, yet the certificate made by the deputy, in the name of the principal, whose name is signed thereto by the deputy, though the deputy's name nowhere appears in the certificate and is not attached to it, is valid. Beaumont v. Yeatman, 27 Tenn. 542, 1847 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1847); Tipton v. Jones, 57 Tenn. 564, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 263 (1873); Ament v. Brennan, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 431 (1873); Cooper v.

      </p>
      <p>
       A deed of trust, made to a trustee, to secure a debt due to the county clerk, is not a deed by nor to him, and may be properly acknowledged before his deputy. Tipton v. Jones, 57 Tenn. 564, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 263 (1873); Cooper v. Hamilton Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 97 Tenn. 285, 37 S.W. 12, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 141, <cite class="am_st_r">56 Am.

       The acknowledgment of a deed of trust or trust assignment before a deputy clerk who is a beneficiary therein is irregular, but not void. Reed Fertilizer Co. v. Thomas, 97 Tenn. 478, 37 S.W. 220, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 169 (1896).

       If a notary takes an acknowledgment to a deed outside the county for which he is appointed, the same is void. Bostic v. Haynie, 36 S.W. 856, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 12 (1896).

       The fact that a mortgage is acknowledged before a notary who is stockholder, director, and manager of the mortgagee corporation does not render the mortgage void, in the absence of fraud, though the court will lend a ready ear to evidence of undue advantage, fraud, or oppression arising out of such relationship.

       The object of the Code was to prescribe a uniform rule for the authentication of all instruments required to be registered by our laws, irrespective of whether they were made and acknowledged or proved within or without the limits of this state; and the certificate of acknowledgment or probate taken to deeds out of the state must accord with and follow substantially the forms prescribed by our statutes, it matters not what is the state of the law on the subject in the state where the probate of a deed is made, and the same need not be certified.

       Tennessee's registration system is one of positive law, founded on general grounds of public policy, and cannot be disregarded. It exacts from courts of chancery obedience as implicit as from courts of law, and it must be expounded and enforced in both alike. Garnett v. Stockton, 26 Tenn. 84, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1846); Brogan v. Savage, 37 Tenn. 689, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 99 (1858); Henderson v. McGhee, 53 Tenn. 55, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 317 (1871).

       The phrase “with whom I am personally acquainted” in such a certificate means a knowledge independent and complete in itself, and existing without other information, and it imports more than a slight or superficial knowledge.

      <p>
       The form of certificate of acknowledgment, essential to a valid registration of the instrument, is prescribed, and is not left to the discretion of the probating officer. Newton Fin. Corp. v. Conner, 161 Tenn. 441, 33 S.W.2d 95, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 27, <cite class="alr">72 A.L.R. 1286</cite> (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       The form for a certificate of acknowledgment, which is essential to the valid registration of a deed, must substantially comply with the statutory language of this section; the language is prescribed and a probating officer has little if any discretion to vary the form of the certificate. If the probating officer does not substantially comply with the statutory form of acknowledgment, the deed is deemed null and void as to existing or subsequent creditors of, or bona fide purchasers from, the makers without notice. In re Anderson, 30 B.R. 995, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18003 (M.D. Tenn. 1983).

       If the substance of the authentication required by law is in the certificate, the unintentional omission of the prescribed words shall not make the authentication invalid. Davis v. Bogle, 58 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (1872); Willingham v. Potter, 131 Tenn. 18, 173 S.W. 434, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate of acknowledgment is not fatally defective where it clearly states that the “within named bargainor(s)” were personal acquaintances of the notary and in addition, the bargainors appeared before the notary and acknowledged the execution of the trust deed. In re Grable, 8 B.R. 363, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 3876 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires that the notary's acknowledgment expressly state that he was “personally acquainted” with the grantor, and the statement by the notary that the grantor “personally appeared before” him is not a sufficient substitute therefor. In re Anderson, 30 B.R. 995, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18003 (M.D. Tenn. 1983).

        5. Equivalent Words.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While it is always safer and better to use the precise words of the statute, yet words of equivalent signification may be substituted for the words prescribed in the statute. The words “with whom I am acquainted” are equivalent to the words “with whom I am personally acquainted,” especially where the certificate shows that the bargainor personally appeared before the officer taking and certifying the acknowledgment. Anderson v. Bewley, 58 Tenn. 29, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 223 (1872); Davis v. Bogle, 58 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (1872); Hunt v. Harris, 59 Tenn. 243, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “specified” may be substituted in the certificate for the word “contained” in the statute, for it quite as comprehensively and accurately expresses the idea designed to be conveyed, as the word used in the statute. Davis v. Bogle, 58 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (1872); Currie v. Kerr, 79 Tenn. 138, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words in the certificate, placed upon the deed itself, “acknowledged the above signatures to be theirs, placed there for the purposes herein specified,” show a substantial acknowledgment of the execution of the instrument, and their substitution for the statutory form “acknowledged that they executed the within instrument for the purposes therein contained,” is a sufficient compliance with the statute, and the certificate is sufficient and valid. Davis v. Bogle, 58 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (1872); Currie v. Kerr, 79 Tenn. 138, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1883); Hughes v. Powers, 99 Tenn. 480, 42 S.W. 1, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the certificate of acknowledgment, the words “who are personally known to me” are equivalent to the statutory words “with whom I am personally acquainted,” for to be “personally acquainted with” and to “know personally” are equivalent phrases. Kelly v. Calhoun, <cite class="us_code">95 U.S. 710</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">24 L. Ed. 544</cite>, 1877 U.S. LEXIS 2226 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the words, “for all the purposes therein expressed,” is sufficient. Hughes v. Powers, 99 Tenn. 480, 42 S.W. 1, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       A certificate that the officer taking the acknowledgment “is satisfied” of the identity of the acknowledger is not equivalent to the statutory language and is insufficient. Newton Fin. Corp. v. Conner, 161 Tenn. 441, 33 S.W.2d 95, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 27, <cite class="alr">72 A.L.R. 1286</cite> (1930).

      <p>
       The certificate of acknowledgment must show that the officer taking the same is acquainted, or personally acquainted, with the bargainor making the acknowledgment; and without such showing, the certificate of acknowledgment is a nullity, and so is the registration of the instrument. Peacock v. Tompkins, 20 Tenn. 135, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1839); Garnett v. Stockton, 26 Tenn. 84, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1846); Johnson v. Walton, 33 Tenn. 258, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1853); Brogan v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The omission to show the officer's personal acquaintance with the bargainor is one of a matter of substance, and is an omission of one of the most important requirements against fraud contained in the form prescribed by the statute. Such omission is not cured by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c26s66-26-113" target="_self">66-26-113</a></cite> curing the unintentional omission of words if the substance of the authentication is in the certificate. Johnson v. Walton, 33 Tenn. 258, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1853); Fall v. Roper, 40 Tenn. 485, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 137 (1859); Harrison v. Wade, 43 Tenn. 505, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1866); Kelly v.

Fly, 137 Tenn. 358, 193 S.W. 117, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1917); Jefferson County Bank v. Hale, 152 Tenn. 648, 280 S.W. 408, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1926); Granger v. Webster, 162 Tenn. 459, 36 S.W.2d 883, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (Dec. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of showing of officer's personal acquaintance with bargainor in the certificate, where the acknowledgment is taken and certified in another state, is fatal. Bone v. Greenlee, 41 Tenn. 29, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1860); Mullins v. Aiken, 49 Tenn. 535, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1871); Kelly v. Calhoun, <cite class="us_code">95 U.S. 710</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">24 L. Ed. 544</cite>, 1877 U.S. LEXIS 2226 (1877); Henderson v. Ish, 3 Shan. 84 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of the phrase “for the purposes therein expressed” was a fatal defect. Literer v. Huddleston, 52 S.W. 1003, 1898 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 174 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       A certificate of acknowledgment reciting that the officer was personally acquainted with the acknowledger, and that she acknowledged the foregoing deed to be her act and deed for the purposes therein contained, is, when considered in connection with the deed, sufficient, though it omits the statutory words “the within named bargainor.” Willingham v. Potter, 131 Tenn. 18, 173 S.W. 434, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1914); Stockton v. Murray, 25 Tenn. App. 371, 157 S.W.2d 859, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 119 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the omission from the certificate of the phrase “for the purposes therein contained” was fatal to the registration of the instrument before passage of Acts 1919, ch. 48, such words are not necessary since its passage. Roysdon v. Choate, 15 Tenn. App. 295, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 96 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       An acknowledgment omitting the notary's statement that he was personally acquainted with the makers of the acknowledgment or that they had been known to him was defective. Savings, Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. McLain, 18 Tenn. App. 292, 76 S.W.2d 650, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 32 (1934); In re Anderson, 30 B.R. 995, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18003 (M.D. Tenn. 1983); In re Airport-81 Nursing Care, Inc., 29 B.R. 501, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6536 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1983); In re Airport-81 Nursing Care, Inc., 36 B.R. 370, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 6427 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission in acknowledgment was below the standard of care required of an attorney preparing instruments for conveyance of real property, giving rise to liability for the damages sustained by nonclients. Collins v. Binkley, 750 S.W.2d 737, 1988 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (Tenn. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Omission of the date on which it was executed does not invalidate a certificate of acknowledgment. Walker v. Midland Mortg. Co. (In re Medlin), 201 B.R. 188, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1279 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1996).

      <p>
       It is well known that many notaries are elected without regard to qualification of applicants and without adequate knowledge of punctuation, and the court will feel justified in supplying a comma in a certificate when to do so will establish that the notary did his duty, and, at the same time, eliminates a superfluous statement; that the notary is “personally acquainted” with a person who is not a party to the instrument. A comma inserted will give the certificate full effect. Calloway v. Witt, 21 Tenn. App. 74, 105 S.W.2d 123, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 9 (1937).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where caption of certificate named Hawkins County, and the notary was commissioned in Sullivan County, and deed conveyed land in Sullivan County and was registered there, and all parties resided there, and certificate recited that acknowledgment was taken “at office,” certificate was not invalid.

       A certified copy of the deed, as registered, is prima facie evidence of the truth of its contents, and the acknowledgment of its execution by the grantor is an acknowledgment of its execution on the day it bears date.

       The statutes prescribed no form for the certificate of probate or authentication upon proof of witnesses, and only provided that the certificate shall be varied so as to adapt it to the various modes of proof prescribed. A certificate, upon the instrument, “that R. P. Bateman appeared before me and made oath that he is well acquainted with the handwriting of B. F. Brown, and that the signature of said Brown, one of the subscribing witnesses to the within, is in his own handwriting,” was held to be a sufficient form. Sharp v. Hunter, 47 Tenn. 389, 1870 Tenn.

      <p>
       The certificate of proof of the handwriting of a subscribing witness is valid, without showing his death or other incapability declared in the statute, if it be otherwise sufficient, for the statute does not require the clerk to certify to the death or statutory incapacity of the subscribing witness, or to examine other witnesses on that point. It would be regular and proper that he should do so, but his certificate is not void if he omit it. Sharp v. Hunter, 47 Tenn. 389, 1870 Tenn.

       The most satisfactory evidence of the proper probate of an instrument, made under this section, is a certified copy of the court records. Where a certified copy of the court record is not given, but the probate is attempted to be shown by the clerk's statement, there must be a record statement, or a statement of facts shown by the record, showing the character of the instrument, by naming the parties and giving some general description of the property, and showing the execution of the deed by the proof of the subscribing witnesses, whose names should be stated. Numerous examples of sufficient and insufficient records and certificates appear in the cases cited. Malone's Lessee v. Stevens, 10 Tenn. 520, 1831 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1831); Greer's Heirs v.

       Where a deed of conveyance of land is lost or destroyed before its registration, chancery has jurisdiction, upon proper allegations and proof, to establish the same, and thus make the evidence of the title a matter of record, even after the death of the grantor. Hord v. Baugh, 26 Tenn. 576, 1847 Tenn. LEXIS 25, 46 Am. Dec. 91 (1847); Montgomery v. Kerr, 46 Tenn. 199, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 50, 98 Am. Dec. 450 (1869); Anderson v. Akard, 83 Tenn. 182, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court has jurisdiction, by decree, to establish and probate instruments where the same, in consequence of the death or incapability of the subscribing witnesses, cannot be probated in the ordinary way, and where the maker refuses to acknowledge the same; and the chancery decree comes in the place of the ordinary probate, and authorizes the registration of the instrument.

       When the attesting or subscribing witnesses to a deed, will, or other instrument are dead or reside beyond the limits of the state, and without jurisdiction of the court, secondary evidence is admissible to prove the instrument by proving the handwriting of the maker and such witnesses.

       <p>
        A sale of personalty, with delivery to the purchaser, is valid without the reduction of the contract to writing, and, if it be reduced to writing, it need not be registered, for registration of such contract is not required by law, and could neither add to nor detract from the validity of the contract. The writing is merely the best evidence of the contract. Tatum v. Jameson & Johnson, 21 Tenn. 298, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1841); Buson v. Dougherty, 30 Tenn. 50, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1850); Williams v.

        An agreement for the conveyance of a crop to be raised and gathered is such an agreement for the conveyance of personal estate that it would, without registration, be void as to creditors or subsequent purchasers for value. Jones v. Chamberlin, 52 Tenn. 210, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 252 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        A written agreement to sell the growing timber on land at so much per cord, to be paid for as fast as used, is a contract for the sale of personal property, the title to which does not pass until it shall be used or received by the purchaser; and, therefore, such contract is a proper instrument for registration; and as it concerns an interest in land, its registration is notice to the world, and a purchaser of such land takes it subject to such prior registered contract. N. Y. & E. T. Iron Co. v. Greene County Iron Co., 58 Tenn. 434, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 282 (1872); Childers v. Wm. H. Coleman Co., 122 Tenn. 109, 118 S.W. 1018, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1909).

        Where purchaser of an automobile had the bill of sale made in his sister's name but did not register the bill of sale, the title passed directly to the sister and was never in the purchaser and the only person who could take advantage of the failure to register the bill of sale would be a creditor or bona fide purchaser of the seller.

        When a chattel mortgage is executed and duly recorded in another state, where the property then is, and where the mortgagor resides, and is valid under the laws of that state, the mortgagee, under the rule of comity, has the better right, upon subsequent removal of the property to this state, as against a levying or attaching creditor of, or an innocent purchaser from, the mortgagor in this state to which the property has been removed, although the mortgage is not recorded in this state; notwithstanding the mortgagor is permitted, under the terms of the mortgage, to retain possession until default; but, such comity should not be extended to cases wherein it appears that the mortgagee consented to such removal, or, having knowledge thereof, does not, within a reasonable time, assert his rights, so as to protect him against encumbrances put upon the property, or against purchases made in this state, after the removal has been made to it.

        Claimant indicated that he had no obligations under the loan documents due to the “Reconveyance” that he filed with the Shelby County Register. He argued that the effect of the Reconveyance was to transfer the property, free and clear of liens, to himself; however, under Tennessee law, he did not have the authority to file a document attempting to release the lien or mark it satisfied, and the Reconveyance had no legal effect.

        This is a penal statute, because it fixes the exact sum to be recovered against the one in default in an action of debt or qui tam; and the statute being penal and not remedial, must be strictly construed. Kitts v. Kitts, 136 Tenn. 314, 189 S.W. 375, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 133 (1916); Phillips v. Cottage Grove Bank & Trust Co., 8 Tenn. App. 98, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 114 (1928).

        T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c25s66-25-102" target="_self">66-25-102</a></cite> is penal, not remedial, in nature and must be strictly construed. In re Cox, 57 B.R. 290, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6802 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1986).

       <p>
        Considering the context in which the phrase “the party instituting suit” is used and the general purpose of the statute, the phrase “the party instituting suit” includes a party asserting a counterclaim; so filing or asserting a counterclaim might be described as instituting a suit or a countersuit. Vinings Bank v. Homeland Cmty. Bank, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 327 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2019).

        In addition to providing a mechanism for obtaining a release of a deed of trust, the purpose of the statute is to penalize the holder of any debt secured by real property who fails to enter a proper release of record after having been fully paid; given that purpose, there is no basis for distinguishing between claims asserted in complaints and claims asserted in counterclaims.

        Where the widow of the deceased lien debtor became the possessor of the entire tract of land under the law awarding her a homestead and dower, she cannot recover against the holder of the debt the penalty for his failure and refusal to satisfy of record the lien retained in the deed to her husband, because she is neither the “owner” nor the “purchaser.” Kitts v.

        New lender was entitled to recovery of its attorney's fees, expenses, and costs because despite the new lender being a defendant in a mortgagee's declaratory judgment action, the new lender's counterclaim for the statutory penalty entitled it to an award of attorney's fees; the amounts paid by the lender satisfied a loan, and despite receiving the payoff and written requests from the lender as required, a Georgia state-chartered bank nnever recorded or provided a release.

       Right to future rents being an incident to an estate in the land, assignment thereof, including rents to accrue beyond a period of three years from its date is within the application of this section, and, as to persons other than the parties thereto, their heirs and representatives, and persons with actual notice, is effective only from the date of its registration.

      <p>
       Since, under the registration laws, a lease, operating to convey the record owner's right to the use and income of land for a period of not more than three years, is valid without registration, his assignment of rent or income for a similar period is likewise unaffected by the registration laws, though such rent is payable under a registered lease for a term of over three years.

       As between the contracting parties, the registration of the vendor's title papers does not constitute constructive notice to the purchaser as to the state of the title of the vendor. Registration is only constructive notice as to third parties; but the purchaser may, as between himself and his vendor, rely upon the representations of his vendor as to his title, and he will not be bound, as between himself and his vendor, by the registered title of which he has not actual notice.

       Registration is constructive notice to a prospective purchaser, and if he fails to search the records, he is guilty of gross negligence, and cannot rely upon the plea of innocent purchaser, as against other claimants of the property, whose rights are shown by a properly registered instrument.

       Where a married woman, under a registered instrument, holds a part of the land mortgaged, but without actual knowledge of the existence of such paper, either by her or the mortgagee, and without intention of fraud on the part of herself or the mortgagee, she joins her husband in a mortgage of the land, joining also in the words of conveyance and of covenant, it was held that the registration of the instrument under which she claimed was notice not only to other persons, but also notice to her, and that, consequently, her interest as a thing legally known to her, but actually unknown, passed under the mortgage. Fogg v. Yeatman, 74 Tenn. 575, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 295 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       The registration of a chattel mortgage does not operate as constructive notice to an auctioneer, broker, or factor, who, in the regular course of his business, receives and sells the mortgaged chattels for the mortgagor, on commission, and pays over to him the proceeds, without actual notice of the mortgage. Frizzell v. Rundle &amp; Co., 88 Tenn. 396, 12 S.W. 918, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 61, <cite class="am_st_r">17 Am. St. R. 908</cite> (1890); Embry v. Galbreath, 110 Tenn. 297, 75 S.W. 1016, 1903 Tenn.

       Where the holders of a certificate of convenience and necessity under the federal Motor Carrier Act mortgaged the certificate and subsequently sold it to a trucking company whose president was informed of the mortgage before the sale, the mortgage was good against the trucking company without registration. Brown v. Smith, 32 Tenn. App. 622, 225 S.W.2d 91, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 112 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       When anything appears which would put a man of ordinary prudence upon inquiry, the law presumes that such inquiry was actually made and therefor fixes the notice upon him as to all legal consequences, and whatever is sufficient to put a person upon inquiry is notice of all the facts to which the inquiry will lead when prosecuted with reasonable diligence and in good faith. Texas Co. v. Aycock, 190 Tenn. 16, 227 S.W.2d 41, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 413, 17 A.L.R.2d 322 (1950).

       Defendant who purchased property under a deed reciting that purchase was subject to a lease had actual notice of lease and its contents including option to buy at specified price even though lease was not recorded.

       A reference in prior deeds conveying water lines stating that it is conveyed “together with” all interests which conveyors have in a contract or ordinance with a city, permitting the installation and maintenance of the system and regulating water flow, did not constitute actual notice or equivalent sufficient to impute knowledge to an otherwise bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer of the city's alleged water rights since it implies rights rather than burdens. Johnson City v. Milligan Utility Dist., 38 Tenn. App. 520, 276 S.W.2d 748, 1954 Tenn. App. LEXIS 138 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1954).

       “Owner's Consent to Pledge of Collateral” was null and void as to a new lender because it lacked actual notice of the agreement; the new lender did not have inquiry notice because nothing in a Georgia state-chartered bank's deed of trust indicated or suggested that further inquiry was necessary, and there was no proof that the bank ever referenced the Owner's Consent in any of its communications with the mortgagor and his brother prior to the closing of the new loan.

       Despite the church's failure to record their deed, the conveyance was binding on the seller, a bank, and the bank no longer owned the disputed property after the sale. Thus, the bank retained no interest in the property that the church was required to quiet and the law of champerty was inapplicable. Milledgeville United Methodist Church v.

       This statute deals with priority among parties claiming under written instruments. It gives a bona fide purchaser without notice no priority of title over one acquiring title by adverse possession before enactment of law requiring registration of the assurance of title. Roysdon v. Terry, 4 Tenn. App. 638, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 214 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).

       In this easement case, appellees granted the hunters an easement for ingress and egress, which was described, depicted, and recorded prior to appellants'  purchase of their property, which was notice for purposes of the statute, and thus appellees had no duty to disclose the recorded easement to appellants. Butler v. Pitts, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 110 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence preponderated against a finding that appellees'  reliance on the misrepresentation in the warranty deed was reasonable; the deed of trust was recorded in 2000, placing all on constructive notice of an encumbrance on the real property, and the true facts were readily available through a simple search of the public record. Because appellees failed to prove an essential element of their claim for intentional misrepresentation, the award of damages was reversed. Erwin v. Great River Rd. Supercross, LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 545 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 1, 2020).

       A deed becomes effective as against the maker's creditors from the date of the noting thereof for registration, although it may remain in the register's office, without being in fact registered, for a long period, and until after the maker's creditors have attached the land conveyed.

       An unregistered deed is void as to the grantor's subsequent creditors where he, without any agreement with the grantee and without his knowledge, delivered the deed to the register, with instructions not to record it until further notice or instructions, which were never given, and himself continuing as the ostensible owner of the property, although the register inadvertently noted the deed for registration. Turberville v. Fowler, 101 Tenn. 88, 46 S.W. 577, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the noting of a deed for registration is made the equivalent of registration, it will not have that effect where the noting is inadvertently done by the register, contrary to the instructions of the party having control of the deed. Turberville v. Fowler, 101 Tenn. 88, 46 S.W. 577, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1898).

      <p>
       When ditto marks are used in the noting of an instrument for registration, they will be read as a repetition or reproduction of the words immediately above them. While the noting, in which ditto marks are used, is held to be valid, the practice is strongly disapproved. Hughes v. Powers, 99 Tenn. 480, 42 S.W. 1, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1897).

      <p>
       Where a deed is noted for registration, and then withdrawn from the register's office, before its registration by the party beneficially interested, or his agent, it loses the benefit of the noting, and will only take effect from the date of its return to the register's office and its renoting. Hughes v. Powers, 99 Tenn. 480, 42 S.W. 1, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1897); Turberville v. Fowler, 101 Tenn. 88, 46 S.W. 577, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1898); Thompson v.

       An instrument properly noted for registration, but actually registered in the wrong book, takes effect as a duly registered instrument from the time it was so noted. Swepson v. Exchange & Dep. Bank, 77 Tenn. 713, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the noting stands for a full and accurate registration of the instrument, while it remains in the office unregistered, the noting has performed its office when actual registration of the instrument has taken place. A defective registration cannot be aided by the effect given by statute to the noting before actual registration. Southern Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Rodgers, 104 Tenn. 437, 58 S.W. 234, 1900 Tenn.

       Registration is constructive notice only as to what appears upon the face of the instrument as registered, and if the property is misdescribed, the registration is a mere nullity. Baldwin v.

       The registration of a deed operates as notice to others only so far as it is correctly registered, and a defective registration cannot be aided by the effect given by statute to the noting before actual registration. The grantee is affected with the consequences of a defectively registered deed. Southern Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Rodgers, 104 Tenn. 437, 58 S.W. 234, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1900).

       Registration of a deed in a county at a time when the land conveyed thereby was no longer a part of such county was wholly ineffective to give notice. Kobbe v. Harriman Land Co., 139 Tenn. 251, 201 S.W. 762, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (1917).

       A registered deed imparts the same notice to the creditor as it imparts to a purchaser as this section only relieves a creditor from the effect of notice of an unregistered instrument. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Kingston Bank & Trust Co., 172 Tenn. 335, 112 S.W.2d 381, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1938).

       The registration of a deed is necessary to make it binding upon existing or subsequent creditors of, or bona fide purchasers from the grantor. Adrian v. Brown, 29 Tenn. App. 236, 196 S.W.2d 118, 1946 Tenn. App. LEXIS 68 (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee law is well settled that the omission of “with whom I am personally acquainted” or similar words constitutes a fatal defect in the acknowledgment of the deed and causes the deed to be null and void as to creditors and bona fide purchasers without notice. In re Anderson, 30 B.R. 995, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18003 (M.D. Tenn. 1983).

       An attaching creditor who records a notice of lis pendens has priority over a bona fide conveyee whose deed is not recorded until after the registration of the lis pendens notice. W. & O. Constr. Co. v. IVS Corp., 688 S.W.2d 67, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3187 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The dismissal of the trust company's claims against the credit corporation was proper where trust deeds and notes had priority over unrecorded trust deeds and notes; the property securing the trust deeds had been sold to a bona fide purchaser for value, and as a matter of law was beyond the reach of the parties. Bankers Trust Co. v. Collins, 124 S.W.3d 576, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 471 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 1256 (Tenn. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Creditor bank's interest in a deed of trust was entitled to priority only as to debtor husband's survivorship interest, where the notarization of debtor wife's signature did not evidence an intent to authenticate and acknowledge her signature, entitling trustee in bankruptcy to avoid the bulk of the secured interest under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 554(b)</cite>. In re Bushee, 319 B.R. 542, 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 2133 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 2004).

       Ownership of a property was established through the deed recorded first, rather than the original deed that was recorded second, because the conveyance for the deed that was recorded first was supported by consideration, while the original deed was misplaced and was not found and recorded until well after the conveyance that was recorded first.

       A purchaser claiming under a deed containing a clause excluding older and better title would not be burdened with the duty of making inquiry or investigation for prior conveyance outside of and beyond the registration books in the absence of actual notice communicated from some other source, for purchasers claiming under deeds which contain exclusion clauses are purchasers the same as those claiming under deeds without such clauses.

       Where in proceeding in chancery alleging a fraudulent conveyance creditors who had not obtained a judgment obtained a levy of attachment on a farm where the deed conveying the property had been probated but not registered, the rights of the parties were not determined by this section but by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c12s29-12-101" target="_blank">29-12-101</a></cite> allowing creditors to file bill in chancery to set aside fraudulent conveyances without having first obtained a judgment at law. Therefore it was not necessary for such creditors to first reduce their claims to judgment and the creditors obtained a lien superior to the unrecorded deed even though they may have had knowledge of the conveyance, and their lien was subject to be defeated only by failure to establish the debt or the fraud.

       “Owner's Consent to Pledge of Collateral” was null and void as to a new lender because it lacked actual notice of the agreement; the new lender did not have inquiry notice because nothing in a Georgia state-chartered bank's deed of trust indicated or suggested that further inquiry was necessary, and there was no proof that the bank ever referenced the Owner's Consent in any of its communications with the mortgagor and his brother prior to the closing of the new loan.

       Land held under an unregistered title bond is subject to levy and sale under execution or attachment against the vendor, and to the judgment lien, as the property of the vendor; but it cannot be levied on and sold under an execution or attachment at law against the vendee, because there is no legal title in him, and only an equitable title, which can be subjected to the payment of his debts by proper proceedings in chancery. Lane v. Marshall, 48 Tenn. 30, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1870); Charles v. Taylor, 48 Tenn. 528, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1870); Lyle v. Longley, 65 Tenn. 286, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 346 (1873); Daniel v.

       Land sold by unregistered deed is liable to execution for debts of the vendor, so long as the deed remains unregistered, though the debt was contracted after the execution of the deed, and with knowledge thereof. Malone v. Brown, 46 S.W. 1004 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       While land held under an unregistered deed may be levied upon against the vendor and vendee, respectively, yet very different results follow in the two cases. As to the execution and attachment creditors of the grantor, a deed is null and void for lack of registration, but it is otherwise as to the creditors of the grantee. The rights of the creditors of the grantee are not fixed by our registration laws, but depend upon rules established independent of these laws. The grantee's creditors would secure, by such levy, only such interest as the grantee actually had in the land at the date of the levy. Bryant v. Bank of Charleston, 107 Tenn. 560, 64 S.W. 895, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1901). See Hood v. Hogue, 131 Tenn. 421, 175 S.W. 531, 1916D Ann. Cas. 383, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1914).

       Where judgment lien attached to property before deed conveying such property was recorded and such lien was enforced by execution within the prescribed time although the levy of the execution did not take place until after the recording of such deed, the title of the purchaser at the execution sale was acquired pursuant to the judgment lien and was therefore superior to the title conveyed by the deed.

       A bona fide purchaser will take free of a prior unrecorded deed or contract only if the bona fide purchaser did not have notice of it. A bankruptcy trustee is not bound by his own personal knowledge or a creditor's knowledge of a prior unrecorded contract or transfer by the debtor, <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 544(a)</cite>(3); however, the trustee is treated as having notice if, under Tennessee law, the facts would put a purchaser on notice.

      Any such instrument entitled to registration which is not duly registered prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days following the death of the maker of any such instrument shall be null and void as to innocent purchasers for a present valuable consideration from such person or persons as would, but for the execution of the instrument by the decedent, succeed to the rights of the decedent to such property in respect to which such unrecorded instrument was executed; provided, that the holder or any person entitled to the benefit of any such unrecorded instrument shall have a right of action against any such transferors for the reasonable value of any such property transferred, to the extent of the interest of the holder in the property, if brought within one (1) year of the recording of the instrument made by such transferors, if the instrument by which the transfer is made is required to be recorded for the protection of the purchaser under the laws of this state, otherwise the action shall be brought within one (1) year from the consummation of such sale or transfer.

       Where trust deed was recorded after execution of contract for sale of land which was not recorded but before execution and recording of warranty deed executed pursuant to such contract, a trustee's deed executed upon foreclosure under such trust deed and recorded after execution and recording of the warranty deed, conveyed good title to grantee under the trustee's deed since recording of trust deed was notice to purchaser.

       In a dispute regarding priority between two recorded deeds of trust after borrowers'  default, judgment in favor of assignee bank was improper as the credit union's registration of its deed of trust with its release provision constituted notice to the world as to what would be required for release; further, the credit union did not misadvise the assignee bank as to what action would be required before the credit union would release its deed of trust, but on the contrary, the credit union in registering its deed of trust provided the assignee bank with complete and accurate information as to the matter of inquiry.

       The provision has retrospective effect and renders deed executed before the statute came into effect and registered for 20 years admissible in evidence though acknowledgment be defective. Perry v. Clift, 54 S.W. 121, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1899).

       Under this section no distinction is made between a void acknowledgment and a defective acknowledgment in applying the presumption that a deed has been registered upon lawful authority when it has been registered 20 years or more, as all inquiry of the subject of probate is cut off and the presumption becomes absolute and conclusive after 20 years from the date of registration.

       Although it may appear upon the face of the papers that the instrument was not properly acknowledged or probated, registration for 20 years creates a conclusive presumption of authority for registration. Webb v. Den, <cite class="us_code">58 U.S. 576</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">15 L. Ed. 35</cite>, 1854 U.S. LEXIS 541 (1854); Green v. Goodall, 41 Tenn. 404, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1860); Kobbe v.

      <p>
       Registration for 20 years only cures defects and omissions in the certificate authenticating instruments for registration, and the failure of the register to register the certificate. Such registration does not render valid and effective a deed or instrument not made in conformity to law. King v. Nutall, 66 Tenn. 221, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1874); Jenkins v. Jenkins, 11 Tenn.

       Registration for the required period under this section cuts off all inquiry, even where the certificate of privy examination of a married woman was fraudulently obtained, and made without her acknowledgment. Seephenson v. Walker, 67 Tenn. 289, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 374 (1874).
      </p>

       A deed of conveyance of land registered for more than 20 years is valid and admissible in evidence though the probate taken before a justice of the peace of another county is unauthorized, null and void.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a deed has been registered for 20 years in the county where the land lies, the terms of the probate are immaterial, and the entire absence of probate is immaterial, because the single fact of registration for 20 years protects the deed with an absolute and indisputable verity.

       A deed registered upon a defective probate becomes effective as a registered deed 20 years after its such registration; and a deed of reconveyance registered upon a defective probate becomes effective likewise; and a subsequent deed of the reconveying grantor, made to a third party, and registered upon a defective probate, becomes effective 20 years after its such registration; so that the grantee under the reconveyance will obtain the title as against such third party under his such subsequently registered deed.

       Where the registration of a deed of conveyance of land, made upon a defective certificate of acknowledgment or probate, has by lapse of 20 years, become a valid registration, a purchaser thereafter is affected with constructive notice by reason of such registration; and while the general rule is that the purchaser is not required to go out of the line of title to ascertain whether each successive holder of the title had made any deed before he acquired title, yet he must see whether each such holder has conveyed after he acquired title, and he must follow that line to the limit to which it leads, and be held to notice of what is thereby shown.

       Where a search of title would have shown that the testator had conveyed the entire tract of land to a grantee who reconveyed it to the testator by a deed prior registration of which became effective under this statute, before the subsequent registration of the deed to a third person, subsequently made by the first grantee and the reconveying grantor, became effective under this statute, a devisee of an undivided interest in the land under the testator's will was not affected with constructive notice of the want of title in the grantee and reconveying grantor because the deed of reconveyance to the testator became effective before the subsequent conveyance to the third party; and such devisee was not affected by the fact that the original grantee was estopped to claim a devise of another undivided interest in the land because of his general warranty deed to the third party.

       While a married woman's power of attorney, even with the joinder of her husband, was void, her deed, executed through the intervention of an attorney in fact and registered for more than 20 years in the county where the land lies, is valid and admissible in evidence.

       The registration of a power of attorney for 20 years renders its proper execution and original validity conclusive, but leaves open to contest the title of the principal and the questions as to the revocation of the power, or its termination otherwise, before the deed was made.

       Where a power of attorney has been registered for 20 years, and a deed has been executed by the attorney in fact under such power, a presumption arises that the power of attorney was properly registered, and that it was valid, and this presumption is indisputable, either by persons sui juris or those under disability.

       An unregistered deed over 30 years old is admissible in evidence, without proof of its execution, where it is found in the proper custody, and is free from suspicion as to its genuineness. As an ancient document, its due execution is presumed, and the subscribing witnesses, though living and present, need not be called to establish that fact; and it is not necessary to show that possession of the land was held under the deed. Woods v. Bonner, 89 Tenn. 411, 18 S.W. 67, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1890). See Applegate v. Lexington &amp; Carter County Mining Co., <cite class="us_code">117 U.S. 255</cite>, <cite class="s_court">6 S.

       The general rule is that a private deed over 30 years old may be admitted in evidence, as an ancient document, without proof of its execution, if it comes from the proper custody, though it is not necessary that it come from the best custody, for it is sufficient if it be in a custody that is reasonable, probable, and natural.

      Every instrument authorized by law to be registered and proved or acknowledged, and registered prior to October 16, 1839, may be read in evidence:

       Although the certificate only states that the deed was duly proved, without naming the subscribing witnesses by whom it was so proved; and in such case, the court shall presume that it was duly proved by all the subscribing witnesses, and the probate and registration shall be good, leaving it to the adverse party to disprove the fact;
      </li>
      <li id="t66c26s66-26-111ol12">
       Although the certificate is not and does not purport to be a transcript from the court minutes, if the certificate states enough to authorize the instrument to be registered; and in this case it shall be presumed that the entry on the minutes authorized the certificate by the clerk, unless the contrary be shown;
      </li>
      <li id="t66c26s66-26-111ol13">
       Although the certificate does not mention the term or style of the court at or in which the instrument was proved or acknowledged; and in this case, it shall be presumed that the instrument was proved or acknowledged in the court of which the person giving the certificate was clerk, and the certificate and registration shall be good, unless the contrary be shown;
      </li>
      <li id="t66c26s66-26-111ol14">
       Although the clerk, in the clerk's entry on the minutes and in the clerk's certificate on the document, has omitted to describe or mention the property; and in such case, the probate or acknowledgment and the registration shall be good;
      </li>
      <li id="t66c26s66-26-111ol15">
       Although the certificate only states that the deed was duly acknowledged, but not by whom; in which case, the instrument shall be presumed to have been acknowledged by the maker, and the acknowledgment and registration shall be good; and

       No such probate or acknowledgment shall be void for want of sufficient certainty therein, if enough is contained on the face of it to identify the instrument to which it applies.

       The provision validating or curing imperfect or defective certificates of acknowledgment or probate is not unconstitutional, though retrospective, because it affects the remedy and not the right. Hughes v. Cannon, 21 Tenn. 589, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1841); Matthewson v. Spencer, 35 Tenn. 513, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1856).

      <p>
       This section did not affect the rights of parties established by decree of court before its passage, and the supreme court decided the rights as they existed under the law when the decree below was rendered. Subsequent legislation curing defective probates and registrations cannot affect rights under decrees thereon previously rendered, because the change of law between the trial in the lower court and the appeal to the supreme court does not change the rights of the parties. Gaines v. Catron, 20 Tenn. 514, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1840); Garnett v. Stockton, 26 Tenn. 84, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1846).

       The substance of the authentication required by law in the certificate of acknowledgment or probate is indispensable to cure the unintentional omission of the prescribed words. Davis v.

      <p>
       If the substance of the authentication required by law is in the clerk's certificate, the unintentional omission of the prescribed words does not make the authentication invalid. Newton Fin.

       An acknowledgment certificate is not necessarily defective merely because it is not identical to the prescribed statutory form; it is only necessary that the acknowledgment certificate substantially comply with the form prescribed. In re Airport-81 Nursing Care, Inc., 29 B.R. 501, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6536 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a bank made a loan to the debtor, a deed of trust was recorded, and a notary certified that the debtor, “unmarried, personally appeared before her,” the certificate of acknowledgment was valid under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c26s66-26-113" target="_self">66-26-113</a></cite>, because it substantially complied with the relevant statutory requirements; furthermore, the certificate of acknowledgment met the criterion in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c22s66-22-114ol1b" target="_self">66-22-114(b)</a></cite> in that it clearly evidenced the intent of the maker of the deed of trust to acknowledge his signature on the instrument; therefore, the deed of trust was properly acknowledged under Tennessee law and was not voidable by a judicial lien creditor or a bona fide purchaser without notice.

       Corporate acknowledgment in trust deed was fatally defective where words “with whom I am personally acquainted” or words “to me personally known” were omitted. In re Englewood Mfg. Co., 28 F. Supp. 653, 1939 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2387 (E.D. Tenn. 1939).

Gregory v. Ocwen Fed. Bank (In re Biggs), 377 F.3d 515, 2004 FED App. 250P, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 15588 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2004).

Baldwin v. Marshall, 21 Tenn. 116, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1840); Boyce v. Stanton, 83 Tenn. 346, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1885). See Stroud v. McDaniel, 80 Tenn. 617, 1883 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       The registration of the corrected certificate of probate or acknowledgment does not relate back to the date of the original registration, so as to divest, defeat, or affect any intervening vested rights in favor of judgment creditors or others that may have attached to the property conveyed. Harrison v. Wade, 43 Tenn. 505, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1866); Stroud v. McDaniel, 80 Tenn. 617, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 213 (1883); Coal Creek Mining Co. v. Heck, 83 Tenn. 497, 1885 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       As between the grantor and volunteers under him and the grantee, the rights of others not intervening, the registration of the corrected certificate of probate or acknowledgment and privy examination relates back to the original acknowledgment. Grotenkemper v. Carver, 77 Tenn. 280, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1882); Stroud v. McDaniel, 80 Tenn. 617, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 213 (1883); Citizens' Bank of Jellico v.

       A register who has made an incorrect registration of a deed, may correct such incorrect registration, and such register is a competent witness to prove the correction and the date thereof in any suit between third persons in regard to such deed.

       A mortgage perfected by the correction of a defective certificate of privy examination prevails over a subsequent deed of conveyance for a preexisting debt, taken with notice of such mortgage before its perfection, because one who so takes a conveyance, pending a suit to foreclose the same, is a volunteer, and cannot resist the claim of the mortgagee. Grotenkemper v. Carver, 72 Tenn. 375, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1880). See Grotenkemper v. Carver, 77 Tenn. 280, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1882).

Consequently, the debtor's argument that some additional step, such as possession or sequestration, was necessary to perfect the receiver's interest was contrary to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c26s66-26-116" target="_self">66-26-116</a></cite> and prior case law.

        Taxes, assessments and other charges of any taxing unit of this state, or of any political subdivision, or any other taxing or assessing authority shall be assessed against and collected on each individual apartment, each of which shall be carried on the tax books as a separate and distinct entity for that purpose, and not on the building or property as a whole. The valuation of the general and limited common elements shall be assessed proportionately among the co-owners of the apartment. The valuation of private elements shall be assessed against the individual owner of the private elements. No forfeiture or sale of the building or property as a whole for delinquent taxes, assessments or charges shall ever divest or in anywise affect the title to an individual apartment so long as taxes, assessments and charges to that individual apartment are currently paid.

        When any ground lease affects the underlying land upon which a condominium project is located or is to be located, and if the ground lease so provides, then each apartment and its respective share of the common elements shall be deemed to be and shall be treated as a separate leasehold estate responsible for such taxes, assessments or other charges, as well as such apartment's share of ground rent which might be charged under such ground lease. Such taxes, assessments and charges, as well as such pro rata share of ground rent, shall be the obligation of the respective apartment owner during such owner's tenure as owner and shall be subject to the lien provided in § 66-27-116.

        If a ground lessor and a developer have entered into a ground lease of underlying land whereon the developer intends to develop a condominium project, and if the ground lease is one in which a “residential ground rent” is created under chapter 30 of this title, individual apartments and their respective pro rata or otherwise allocated share of general common elements shall be deemed to be separate leasehold estates, and the ground lessor shall agree in all such ground leases that the owners of the individual apartments shall be separate and independent obligors under such ground lease and that the default of one (1) apartment owner shall not be deemed to be a default of all apartment owners in the condominium project. Only those individual apartment owners who default on their allocated share of obligations to the ground lessor, as the same are determined in the master deed, master lease or such ground lease, shall be deemed to be in default with the ground lessor. The ground lessor's remedies are limited to suit and satisfaction of such default from the defaulting apartment owner, the defaulting owner's apartment, and the defaulting owner's allocated interest in the general common elements. The only positive covenant obligations which any apartment owner shall have to the ground lessor shall be:

Any other positive covenant obligations of the obligor, as defined in § 66-30-102, that arises under the ground lease shall be deemed to have been satisfied during the period of construction and development prior to the time that the ground lease allows the closing of the sale of the first apartment. If there are any negative covenant obligations under such ground lease, then they shall be enforceable only against the individual apartment owner in violation thereof and only to the extent that such obligations are reasonably the obligation of an individual apartment owner.

        Tenant's pleading was adequate to state a claim for relief under either the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act or under a theory of common law negligence because it clearly established the parties relationship, i.e., landlord and tenant, and alleged that the landlord had a duty to repair an apartment ceiling after the tenant notified it of a leak; the pleading also asserted that the landlord's negligence stemmed from its failure to make necessary repairs.

        Chancery court erred in setting aside a general sessions court judgment entered in favor of a property owner in his forcible entry and detainer (FED) action because the Tennessee Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act specifically gave the general sessions and circuit courts jurisdiction over FED actions; the notice provision in the Act is intended to protect the rights of the parties under the lease and does not implicate the authority of the general sessions court to hear the matter.

         Exculpatory provision in tenant's lease was void as against public policy. Crawford v. Buckner, 839 S.W.2d 754, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the residential landlord-tenant relationship, the public policy against exculpatory clauses, affecting the public interest, should control lease provisions limiting a landlord's liability to its tenants. Crawford v. Buckner, 839 S.W.2d 754, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section declares no public policy in the area of exculpatory clauses for the least populous counties of the state; therefore, the limited application of the section is not a declaration by the legislature that the public policy of Tennessee favors freedom of contract for residential leases in the counties not covered by this section. Crawford v. Buckner, 839 S.W.2d 754, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1992).

           Trial court properly entered a monetary judgment against the tenants because the trial court found that the tenants left the premises in “deplorable condition” in violation of the lease and statute, there was neither a trial transcript nor a statement of the evidence in the record, their brief failed to conform to the procedural rules, and nothing in the record supported their allegation that they did not receive a fair trial due to the landlord's family's influence in the court system, and both the terms of the lease itself and the applicable statutes entitled the landlord to apply the security deposit toward repairing the damages caused by the tenants and to seek recovery for additional physical damage to the premises over and above the amount of the security deposit.

           If the landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or willfully diminishes services to the tenant by interrupting essential services as provided in the rental agreement to the tenant, the tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either case, recover actual damages sustained by the tenant, and punitive damages when appropriate, plus a reasonable attorney's fee. If the rental agreement is terminated under this section, the landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security deposits.

Unless the holder of such property is notified to the contrary within one hundred twenty (120) days after filing the report required under § 66-29-123, the treasurer is deemed to have elected to receive custody of the property and the holder thereof shall, at the end of such one hundred twenty (120) days, pay or deliver such property to the treasurer.

       Compiler's Notes. Acts 2017, ch. 461, § 1 amended subsection (b) of this section, effective from May 25, 2017 until July 1, 2017. The amended version of subsection (b) read as follows:  “(b) The commissioner of health shall direct these funds, subject to the approval of the commissioner of finance and administration, to programs designed to enhance health access. The programs may include, but not be limited to, funding for services provided by federally qualified health centers, recruitment incentives, community initiatives, service-linked training opportunities, support for high technology/telecommunications efforts, prevention initiatives, efforts to improve the built environment, strategies to improve the health of the population, and other strategies to expand primary, obstetric and dental health care services in underserved areas. Pursuant to a finding of need by the commissioner, the health access program may also address the lack of adequate access in underserved areas to other health care providers and health care services such as emergency medicine, mental health care, and  prevention treatment services for low income, pregnant substance abusers.”

      The obligor shall have the right to redeem a residential ground rent at any time after three (3) years from the date of the ground rent agreement. The redemption shall be effected for such amount as the obligor and the obligee may have agreed upon; or, in the absence of such an agreement, shall be determined by capitalizing the ground rent in effect at the time of redemption at ten percent (10%). Upon tender of such amount by the obligor, together with any lawfully collectible arrearages of rent and interest thereon, the obligor may redeem the land from, and shall be entitled to a release from, all obligation to pay ground rent and to a warranty deed. Such release and such deed shall be in recordable form and the cost of recording the same, together with any other charges incidental to it, other than the state transfer tax, shall be paid by the obligor. The obligor's right to redeem may be assigned absolutely or as collateral security to the holder of any deed of trust or mortgage on the interest of the obligor in the real estate, and such deed of trust or mortgage may require that the obligor exercise the obligor's right to redeem upon the written demand of the trustee or beneficiary thereunder, and that a failure to exercise such right of redemption, under such circumstances, shall constitute a material default under such deed of trust or mortgage.

       The owner of a self-service storage facility and the owner's heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns have a lien upon all personal property located at a self-service storage facility for rent, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the personal property and for expenses necessary for its preservation or expenses reasonably incurred in its sale or other disposition pursuant to this chapter. The lien provided for in this section is superior to any other lien or security interest, except those which are perfected and recorded in the state in the name of the occupant during the term of the rental agreement and except any tax lien as otherwise provided by law. The lien attaches when personal property is placed in the leased space.

Any late fee imposed by the owner pursuant to this section is in addition to any other remedy provided by law or contract.

       The owner shall provide adequate notice to the occupant before a late fee is imposed. Adequate notice is provided if the rental agreement complies with subsection (b) or if a notice is sent to the occupant at the last known address and notifies the occupant that a late fee may be charged for any month in which the occupant does not pay rent when due.

       Finder could not demonstrate interest in the property in the storage unit which would entitle him to recover the seized funds, as none of the conditions allowing the owner to enter the storage unit existed, and the facility's unlawful trespass did not confer upon it any ownership interest in the property contained in the unit; thus, it had no authority to sell or otherwise dispose of that property.

        Where the attorney general is clothed with authority to bring an action under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act of 1977, title 47, ch. 18, part 1, and title 66, ch. 32, part 1, the attorney general's standing does not depend on the outcome of the claims. State v. Heath, 806 S.W.2d 535, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 800 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (Tenn. Mar. 11, 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Participation in action was well within the attorney general's discretion where underlying financing on time-share units contained no protection for non-defaulting purchasers and where such omission could cause many consumers to lose money invested in time-shares. The attorney general's standing under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act of 1977 arose from T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c18s47-18-114" target="_blank">47-18-114</a></cite> and standing under this part arose under the attorney general's broad statutory and common law powers. State v. Heath, 806 S.W.2d 535, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 800 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (Tenn. Mar. 11, 1991).

       A judicial proceeding where the accuracy of the public offering statement or validity of any contract of purchase is in issue and a rescission of the contract or damages is sought must be commenced within four (4) years after the date of the contract of purchase, notwithstanding that the purchaser's terms of payments may extend beyond the period of limitation. However, with respect to the enforcement of provisions in the contract of purchase which require the continued furnishing of services and the reciprocal payments to be made by the purchaser, the period of bringing a judicial proceeding will continue for a period of four (4) years for each breach, but the parties may agree to reduce the period of limitation to not less than two (2) years.

        In an action over the parties'  duties under a construction contract, an award of attorney fees to the construction corporation was appropriate under the Prompt Pay Act of 1991, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-101" target="_self">66-34-101</a></cite> et seq., because there was insufficient evidence in the record to overturn the trial court's conclusion that the development corporation acted in bad faith. Inherent in the trial court's decision that the development corporation willfully attempted to take advantage of the construction corporation was a determination that a senior vice-president of the development corporation was not credible on the issue; further, the record showed that the development corporation intentionally withheld approximately $60,000 for work and materials that the construction corporation had already provided, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-202ol1a" target="_self">66-34-202(a)</a></cite>.

      <ol class="alpha">
       <li id="t66c34s66-34-104ol1a">
        Whenever, in any contract for the improvement of real property, a certain amount or percentage of the contract price is retained, that retained amount must be deposited in a separate, interest-bearing, escrow account with a third party which must be established upon the withholding of any retainage.
       </li>
       <li id="t66c34s66-34-104ol1b">
        As of the time of the withholding of the retained funds, the funds become the sole and separate property of the prime contractor or remote contractor to whom they are owed, subject to the rights of the person withholding the retainage in the event the prime contractor or remote contractor otherwise entitled to the funds defaults on or does not complete its contract.
       </li>
       <li id="t66c34s66-34-104ol1c">
        If the party withholding the retained funds fails to deposit the funds into an escrow account as provided in this section, then the party shall pay the owner of the retained funds an additional three hundred dollars ($300) per day as damages, not as a penalty, for each and every day that the retained funds are not deposited into an escrow account. Damages accrue from the date retained funds were first withheld and continue to accrue until placed into a separate, interest-bearing escrow account or otherwise paid.
       </li>
       <li id="t66c34s66-34-104ol1d">
        The party with the responsibility for depositing the retained amount in a separate, interest-bearing escrow account with a third party has the affirmative duty to provide written notice that the party has complied with this section to any prime contractor upon withholding the amount of retained funds from each and every application for payment, including:
        <ol>

        Upon satisfactory completion of the contract, to be evidenced by a written release by the owner, prime contractor, or remote contractor owing the retainage, all funds accumulated in the escrow account together with all interest on the account must be paid immediately to the prime contractor or remote contractor to whom the funds and interest are owed.

       <li id="t66c34s66-34-104ol1f">
        If the owner, prime contractor, or remote contractor, as applicable, fails or refuses to execute the release provided for in subsection (e), then the prime contractor or remote contractor, as applicable, may seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as provided in § 66-34-602, against the owner, prime contractor, or remote contractor. Relief may not be sought against the person holding the retainage as an escrow agent, and that person bears no liability for the nonpayment of the retainage; however, a court may issue an order to the person holding retainage to pay any sums held in trust pursuant to § 66-34-205. The person paying the sums pursuant to a court order bears no liability to the owner, prime contractor, or remote contractor for the payment. All other claims, demands, disputes, controversies, and differences that may arise between the owner, prime contractor, or prime contractors, and remote contractors may be, upon written agreement of all parties concerned, settled by arbitration conducted pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act, compiled in title 29, chapter 5, part 3, or the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), as may be applicable.

      </p>
      <p>
       “(f)  In the event the owner or prime contractor, as applicable, fails or refuses to execute the release provided for in subsection (c), then the prime contractor or remote contractor, as applicable, may seek any remedy in a court of proper jurisdiction and the person holding the fund as escrow agent shall bear no liability for the nonpayment of the fund to the prime contractor or remote contractor; provided, however, that all claims, demands, disputes, controversies, and differences that may arise between the owner, prime contractor or prime contractors, and remote contractor or remote contractors regarding the funds may be, upon written agreement of all parties concerned, settled by arbitration conducted pursuant to the Tennessee Uniform Arbitration Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, part 3, or the Federal Arbitration Act (<cite class="us_code">9 U.S.C. § 1</cite>, et seq.), as may be applicable.

        Where a subcontractor for plumbing knew it was a subcontractor to a general contractor under contract to a governmental entity, and the general contractor, pursuant to contract, withheld retainage for work done on the subcontract, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.12.html#t12c04s12-4-108" target="_blank">12-4-108</a></cite> and not former T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c11s66-11-144" target="_self">66-11-144</a></cite> [transferred to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-104" target="_self">66-34-104</a></cite>] was applicable, and the contractor and not the subcontractor was entitled to interest on the retainage held.

        Even though appellant's contract with appellee was the basis for its retainage claim, the contract was not the basis for its claim for $ 300-per-day damages under the statute, which described its relief as a penalty; the Prompt Payment Act was the basis for appellant's claim, and thus the one-year statute of limitations period applicable to statutory penalties governed this claim.

Although the bank had a lien on the real property, such interests were not among those real property interests “which may be sold under process.” Western Surety Company v.

        Chancery court properly granted summary judgment to a general contractor on the subcontractor's claims for fraud and punitive damages and awarded a judgment to the subcontractor on its breach of contract claim because, even if the contractor intentionally misrepresented the scope of the work, the subcontractor did not rely on the misrepresentation, both parties were mistaken about the contents or effect of the subcontract, the evidence did not establish egregious conduct by the contractor, the contractor breached the subcontract by failing to pay an application, and the subcontractor was not entitled to remedies under the Prompt Pay Act where the subcontract did not provide for retainage and neither party acted in bad faith.

         In an action over the parties'  duties under a construction contract, an award of attorney fees to the construction corporation was appropriate because there was insufficient evidence in the record to overturn the trial court's conclusion that the development corporation acted in bad faith. Inherent in the trial court's decision that the development corporation willfully attempted to take advantage of the construction corporation was a determination that a senior vice-president of the development corporation was not credible on the issue; further, the record showed that the development corporation intentionally withheld approximately $60,000 for work and materials that the construction corporation had already provided, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-202ol1a" target="_self">66-34-202(a)</a></cite>.

             As the buyer honestly believed that it did not owe the money claimed by the seller, and in resisting the seller's claim, buyer was not using the technicalities of the law to take unconscientious advantage of the seller, the trial court properly denied the latter's request for attorney fees under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-602ol1b" target="_self">66-34-602(b)</a></cite>.

             In an action over the parties'  duties under a construction contract, an award of attorney fees to the construction corporation was appropriate under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-602ol1b" target="_self">66-34-602(b)</a></cite> because there was insufficient evidence in the record to overturn the trial court's conclusion that the development corporation acted in bad faith. Inherent in the trial court's decision that the development corporation willfully attempted to take advantage of the construction corporation was a determination that a senior vice-president of the development corporation was not credible on the issue; further, the record showed that the development corporation intentionally withheld approximately $60,000 for work and materials that the construction corporation had already provided. Madden Phillips Constr. v. Ggat Dev. Corp., 315 S.W.3d 800, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 645 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2009), appeal denied, Madden Phillips Constr., Inc. v. GGAT Dev.

             Contractor was entitled to attorney's fees for an owner's Prompt Payment Act violation because the contractor showed the owner's bad faith by demonstrating the owner's intentional violation. Beacon4, LLC v. I & L Invs., LLC, 514 S.W.3d 153, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 637 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2016), appeal denied, Beacon4, LLC v. I & L Invs., LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 950 (Tenn.

             As a matter of first impression, a contractor was entitled to an award of appellate attorney's fees for an owner's violation of the Prompt Payment Act because (1) the contractor showed the owner's bad faith, and (2) the contractor's appellate pleadings sought such an award. Beacon4, LLC v. I & L Invs., LLC, 514 S.W.3d 153, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 637 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2016), appeal denied, Beacon4, LLC v. I & L Invs., LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 950 (Tenn.

             Because the contractor provided the owner with the information it was required to provide under statute before it filed suit, and because the owner was not prejudiced by the method the contractor used to provide notice, Federal Express rather than registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the contractor substantially complied with the statute and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment and dismissing the contractor's claims under the Prompt Pay Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t66c34s66-34-101" target="_self">66-34-101</a></cite> et seq.Aarene Contr. v.

      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1a">
       In actions brought against a prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional related to an alleged construction defect, the claimant shall, before filing an action, serve written notice of claim on the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional, as applicable. The claimant shall endeavor to serve the notice of claim within fifteen (15) days after discovery of an alleged defect, or as required by contract. Unless otherwise prohibited by contract, the failure to serve notice of claim within fifteen (15) days does not bar the filing of an action, subject to § 66-36-102.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1b">
       Within ten (10) business days after service of the notice of claim, the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional may inspect the structure to assess each alleged construction defect. The claimant shall provide the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional and its lower-tier remote contractors or agents reasonable access to the improvement during normal working hours to inspect the improvement, to determine the nature and cause of each alleged construction defect, and the nature and extent of any corrections, repairs, or replacements necessary to remedy each defect. The inspection may include destructive testing. Prior to performing any destructive testing, the person who desires to perform the testing shall notify the claimant in writing of the type of testing to be performed, the anticipated damage to the improvement that will be caused by the testing, and the anticipated corrections or repairs that will be necessary to correct or repair any damage caused by the testing. The person performing the testing shall correct and repair any damage to the improvement caused by the testing.

       Within ten (10) days after service of the notice of claim, the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional must forward a copy of the notice of claim to each prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional who it reasonably believes is responsible for each defect specified in the notice of claim and shall note the specific defect for which it believes the particular prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional is responsible. Each such prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional may inspect the improvement as provided in subsection (b) within ten (10) business days after receiving a copy of the notice.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1d">
       Within ten (10) business days after receiving a copy of the notice of claim, the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional must serve a written response to the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional who served a copy of the notice of claim. The written response must include a report of the scope of any inspection of the improvement; the findings and results of the inspection; a statement of whether the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional is willing to make corrections or repairs to the improvement or whether it disputes the claim; a description of any corrections or repairs it is willing to make to remedy the alleged construction defect; and a timetable for the completion of such corrections or repairs.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1e">
       Within thirty (30) days after receiving the notice of claim, each prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional must serve a written response to the claimant. The written response must provide:

        <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1e1">
         A written offer to remedy the alleged construction defect at no cost to the claimant, including a report of the scope of the inspection, the findings and results of the inspection, a detailed description of the corrections or repairs necessary to remedy the defect, and a timetable for the completion of the repairs;
        </li>
        <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1e2">
         A written offer to compromise and settle the claim by monetary payment to be paid within thirty (30) days after the claimant's acceptance of the offer; or
        </li>
        <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1e3">
         A written statement that the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional disputes the claim and will not remedy the defect or compromise and settle the claim.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1f">
       If the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional offers to remedy the alleged construction defect or compromise and settle the claim by monetary payment, then the written response must contain a statement that the claimant is deemed to have accepted the offer if, within fifteen (15) days after service to the written response, the claimant does not serve a written rejection of the offer on the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1g">
       If the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional does not respond to the claimant's notice of claim within the time provided in subsection (e), then the claimant may, without further notice, proceed with an action against the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional for the claim described in the notice of claim.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1h">
       A claimant who rejects a settlement offer made by the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional must serve written notice of the rejection on the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional within fifteen (15) days after service of the settlement offer. The claimant's rejection must contain the settlement offer with the word “rejected” printed on it.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1i">
       If the claimant accepts the offer of a prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional and the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional does not make the payment, correction, or repair the defect within the agreed time and in the agreed manner, then the claimant may, without further notice, proceed with an action against the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional. If a claimant accepts a prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional's offer and the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional makes payment, correction, or repairs the defect within the agreed time and in the agreed manner, then the claimant is barred from proceeding with an action against the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional for the claim described in the notice of claim.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1j">
       If the claimant accepts the offer of a prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional to correct or repair an alleged construction defect, then the claimant shall provide the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional and their remote contractors or other agents reasonable access to the claimant's improvement during normal working hours to perform the correction or repair by the agreed-upon timetable as stated in the offer.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1k">
       The failure of a claimant or a prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional to follow the procedures in this section is admissible in an action. However, this section does not prohibit or limit the claimant from making any necessary emergency corrections or repairs to the improvement. In addition, the offer of a prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional to remedy an alleged construction defect or to compromise and settle the claim by monetary payment does not constitute an admission of liability with respect to the defect.
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1l">
       A claimant's written notice of claim under subsection (a) tolls the applicable statute of limitations until the later of:

        <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1l1">
         One hundred eighty (180) days after the prime contractor, remote contractor, or design professional receives the notice; or

        <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1l2">
         Ninety (90) days after the end of the correction or repair period stated in the offer, if the claimant has accepted the offer. By stipulation of the parties, the period may be extended and the statute of limitations is tolled during the extension.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t66c36s66-36-103ol1m">
