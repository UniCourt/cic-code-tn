        Whenever the district attorney general of any judicial district in this state is of the opinion that any death occurring in any county in that district attorney general's judicial district has proceeded from a felonious cause, and that the cause of death cannot be adequately and safely determined in the absence of an autopsy upon the body of the deceased, the district attorney general may file with the judge of the court having criminal jurisdiction the district attorney general's sworn petition, which shall set forth the district attorney general's belief that the death in question proceeded from a felonious cause, that the cause of death cannot be adequately determined in the absence of an autopsy and the reasons that actuate the district attorney general's belief as to the felonious nature of such death. Such petition may be presented to the judge having criminal jurisdiction, either in term time or in vacation, and either in the county in which it is claimed that the homicide occurred or in any other county of the judicial district, and the judge shall have power and authority to pass upon the same in any county of that judge's district.

The physician holding the autopsy shall file in the office of the clerk of the court having criminal jurisdiction in the county a full and complete report of the physician's findings in connection with the autopsy, which report shall be available to such parties as may be interested in the report.

       There must be some words or overt acts at the time, clearly indicating a present purpose to carry the threats into execution, and inflict death or some great bodily harm upon the defendant; past threats or hostile actions or antecedent circumstances can only be looked to in connection with present demonstrations as grounds of apprehension. Rippy v. State, 39 Tenn. 217, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (1858); Chambers v. Porter, 45 Tenn. 273, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1868); Williams v. State, 50 Tenn. 376, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1872); Little v.

      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where the statute is applicable, a person would be excused for acting upon a well-grounded apprehension — as in cases of self-defense, but not when there is a lack of evidence raising the question. Fisher v. State, 78 Tenn. 151, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       Previous threats, conduct, and language of the accused upon meeting the deceased that are equivalent to an overt act justified the deceased in acting in self-defense, and deprived the accused of that right. Cooper v. State, 123 Tenn. 37, 138 S.W. 826, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1911).

      <p>
       A killing, warranted as in self-defense, must be done under an honest, existing, and well-founded belief that it is absolutely necessary in self-defense. Rippy v. State, 39 Tenn. 217, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (1858); Draper v. State, 63 Tenn. 246, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 239 (1874); Hull v. State, 74 Tenn. 249, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 243 (1880); Barnard v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant must fear death or great bodily harm to warrant killing in self-defense. If any less injury than death or great bodily harm is feared or indicated by the circumstances, the plea of self-defense will not be sustained, though the degree of homicide may be reduced. Rippy v. State, 39 Tenn. 217, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (1858).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the defendant was in danger of death or great bodily harm from his assailant, or if he was not in such danger, but honestly believed himself to be so, upon reasonable evidence gathered from all the surrounding circumstances as they appeared to him, and he really feared death or some great bodily harm from his assailant, and, acting under such fear, he killed his adversary, it would be justifiable homicide.

       The belief of the danger and the actual fear of it must exist at the very moment of the killing, though the danger need not exist and be imminent at the very moment of the killing, but if the defendant honestly fears, from all the circumstances, that it will exist and be imminent in a few moments, he may anticipate it, and slay his assailant. Allsup v. State, 73 Tenn. 362, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1880); Hull v. State, 74 Tenn. 249, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 243 (1880).

       If the defendant be assaulted, being determined not to fight except in his self-defense, or being otherwise without fault in the particular transaction, or, if in fault, after using all means in his power to escape, and is in danger, or, on some reasonable ground, thinks himself in danger of his life or great bodily harm, the killing of his assailant will be justifiable. Hull v. State, 74 Tenn. 249, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 243 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant in wrongful death action shot at prowler who was looking in her window and killed a bystander, fact that the person at whom she was shooting was guilty of a misdemeanor did not exonerate her from exercising ordinary care. Goodrich v. Morgan, 40 Tenn. App. 342, 291 S.W.2d 610, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 154 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

      <p>
       Where, in wrongful death action, defendant testified that he saw decedent looking in window of his sister's room with his hand on screen, and that when he flashed his light on him he ran away and when he did not stop after defendant called to him, defendant shot him, verdict for defendant was error. Gross v. Abston, 44 Tenn. App. 68, 311 S.W.2d 817, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 151 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

       The right to kill in self-defense begins where the necessity begins and ends where the necessity ends and one cannot go further than is reasonably necessary in defense of his person. May v. State, 220 Tenn. 541, 420 S.W.2d 647, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 435 (1967).

       In prosecution of prison inmate for killing his cell mate where there was evidence in the record to the effect that defendant stabbed the deceased numerous times and upon being pulled off the deceased by guard was belligerent and vengeful and would have attacked again if he had not been restrained but defendant's own testimony was to the effect that he was subject to initial attack and had acted in self-defense, issue of self-defense was for the jury. May v. State, 220 Tenn. 541, 420 S.W.2d 647, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 435 (1967).

       If a person being on an affray, by making the first attack, he cannot excuse himself as for a killing or a stabbing in self-defense, unless he show that he quit, or offered to quit, the combat, and retreated as far as he could in safety, if the fierceness of his adversary permitted. Crowder v. State, 76 Tenn. 669, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1881).

       Every killing by one who provokes a quarrel is not a felonious homicide, and the right of self-defense exists, notwithstanding some fault in provoking the difficulty, unless it was provoked with the intent to kill his adversary, or to do him great bodily harm, or to afford him a pretext for wreaking his malice upon his adversary. Foutch v. State, 95 Tenn. 711, 34 S.W. 423, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 146, <cite class="lra">45 L.R.A. 687</cite> (1895).

       The fact that the assaulted person was unlawfully carrying a pistol cannot interfere with his right to use it in his proper self-defense, where the facts justify his action, to save his life or person from great violence. State v. Bowling, 3 Shan. 110 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where great bodily violence is being threatened or inflicted upon a weak person by one much stronger and heavier, with his fists, and with such determined energy that the person assaulted may reasonably apprehend death or great bodily injury, he is justified in using a deadly weapon upon his assailant. It makes no difference whether the bodily violence is being inflicted with a bludgeon or with the fists of an overpowering adversary of superior strength and greater size. State v. Bowling, 3 Shan. 110 (1880).

      <p>
       The character of the deceased for violence as well as his animosity towards the defendant, as indicated by words and actions, then and before, were proper matters for the consideration of the jury in determining whether the defendant had reasonable grounds to fear death or great bodily harm. Rippy v. State, 39 Tenn. 217, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (1858); Williams v. State, 50 Tenn. 376, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1872); Frazier v. State, 117 Tenn. 430, 100 S.W. 94, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1906).

      <p>
       Where defendant raised issue of self-defense, in order for jury to determine whether or not the accused was acting under a reasonable fear of his own life, evidence of previous threats and acts of hostility by the victim, as well as his character and the facts and circumstances immediately preceding the assault should be admitted. Ellis v. State, 555 S.W.2d 731, 1977 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 300 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1977).
      </p>

       Previous threats communicated to the defendant were admissible in evidence, and, when not communicated, they were admissible where the acts of the deceased at the fatal meeting were of doubtful character, as such threats tended to show his animus and illustrate his conduct. Jackson v. State, 65 Tenn. 452, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 387 (1873); Little v. State, 65 Tenn. 491, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 390 (1873); Fitzhugh v. State, 81 Tenn. 258, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1884); Potter v.

       “Great bodily harm” means “great personal violence” which need not necessarily endanger life; and it is error to define “great bodily harm” to be such as would give one reasonable apprehension that his life was in danger. Greer v. State, 65 Tenn. 629, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 466 (1872); Hull v. State, 74 Tenn. 249, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 243 (1880).

State ex rel. Thompson v. Reichman, 135 Tenn. 653, 188 S.W. 225, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 46 (1916), rehearing denied, 135 Tenn. 685, 188 S.W. 597, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1916).

       It is the duty of the sheriff or constable to arrest, without a warrant, for the threatened unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors and to close the place of business, and such action is not unlawful as an arbitrary invasion of property rights, for such threatened sale is a threatened “breach of the peace.” State ex rel.

     <p>
      No inquest shall be held by the coroner or any court of general sessions over the dead body of any person until an affidavit, in writing, is made and signed by two (2) or more reliable persons, averring the death of the person and that there is good reason to believe that the person died by unlawful violence at the hands of some other person; and without the affidavit, in writing, the coroner or court shall have no jurisdiction to hold an inquest over the dead body of any person, and all proceedings without the affidavit shall be utterly void and useless. Unless this section is literally, rigidly, and strictly complied with, and the affidavit filed with the papers, the coroner or court shall receive no fees or compensation for holding the inquest.

        The admissibility of breath test results required that the testing officer be able to testify: (1) That the tests were performed in accordance with the standards and operating procedure promulgated by the forensic services division of the Tennessee bureau of investigation; (2) That he was properly certified in accordance with those standards; (3) That the evidentiary breath testing instrument used was certified by the forensic services division, was tested regularly for accuracy and was working properly when the breath test was performed; (4) That the motorist was observed for the requisite 20 minutes prior to the test, and during this period, he did not have foreign matter in his mouth, did not consume any alcoholic beverage, smoke, or regurgitate; (5) That he followed the prescribed operational procedure; (6) That he can identify the printout record offered in evidence as the result of the test given to the person tested.

        Where a 1974 consent decree barred dissemination of arrest records of individuals who had been arrest but not yet convicted of crimes had been honored more in breach than in the observance, district court vacated the decree, because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.10.html#t10c07s10-7-503" target="_blank">10-7-503</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t38c06s38-6-120" target="_self">38-6-120</a></cite> mandated that arrest records be made available to the public; plaintiff could not argue that the consent decree barred a city police department from posting pictures of alleged patrons of prostitution and other individuals arrested in prostitution stings on the internet.

        The general assembly finds that in the case of a missing citizen who has wandered due to dementia, physical impairment, or disability, the first few hours are critical in finding the citizen. To aid in the identification and location of missing citizens, there is created the Care Alert program. This program shall be coordinated by local law enforcement agencies which may choose to seek the assistance of nonprofit organizations such as A Child is Missing, the Alzheimer's Association, or Alzheimer's Tennessee. Local law enforcement agencies are encouraged to develop area-specific protocols for implementation of this program. The Tennessee bureau of investigation is encouraged to develop an appropriate card patterned after the first two (2) sections of the Amber Alert Activation Card but addressing the situation of missing citizens who have wandered due to dementia or physical impairment.
