If the state deems it appropriate to convey such real property and production equipment to the contractor, then the amount of remuneration to be paid by the contractor or its successor to the state shall be determined at the time the real property and production equipment is originally conveyed to the contractor, to be based upon the appraised value of the real property and production equipment at the time of the original conveyance to the contractor.

            It is the intent of the legislature that the state of Tennessee, through the bureau of TennCare, be designated as the authorized representative for elderly and disabled enrollees, who are eligible medicare beneficiaries, but have lost or may lose eligibility for TennCare benefits due to changes in the TennCare program, for the purpose of facilitating and effectuating enrollment in a medicare-approved prescription drug discount card program or programs, and for applying for transitional assistance program medicare drug benefits, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq. As the eligible enrollee's legally authorized representative for this purpose, TennCare may designate or select one (1) or more programs as preferred plans, for purposes of automatically enrolling such medicare beneficiaries, to expedite access to prescription drug discounts and secure related transitional assistance payments for those medicare enrollees eligible for such assistance.

        Tennessee court found that it had jurisdiction over a father living in Colorado because the mother was receiving public assistance in Tennessee at the time that the mother filed a petition for custody and requested the court to set support. Thus, Tennessee had a vested interest in assisting the mother to receive child support from the father because, upon receipt of public assistance, the mother was deemed to have assigned the mother's rights to recover child support to the State of Tennessee.

           “The general assembly hereby takes official notice of the fact that alternatives currently available to families with medically and/or technology-dependent children are difficult, if not intolerable. Too often, limited alternatives dictate that medically and/or technology-dependent children remain hospitalized for extended periods at great financial and emotional cost to parents and children. Too often, limited alternatives dictate that such children be maintained at home using extensive, private duty nursing services at great financial as well as emotional cost to parents and children who endure the long-term effects of isolation. Too often, limited alternatives dictate that single working parents, and families who must rely on two (2) incomes for economic survival, permanently leave their medically and/or technology-dependent children in institutional settings and suffer grave financial and emotional consequences. Prescribed child care centers offer the potential of providing a much needed alternative for these families. While assisting in the containment of health care costs, prescribed child care centers also offer medically and/or technology-dependent children and their families a comprehensive, developmentally appropriate nonresidential environment of coordinated medical, developmental, and parental training services. Through this enactment, it is the intent of the general assembly to encourage and support the increased availability and affordability of prescribed child care centers of quality.”

            Any of such asylums may, at discretion, receive any child placed in its care and keeping by such child's parents or guardian, or those having the child in charge, and may keep and care for the child until the child is eighteen (18) years of age, unless sooner taken away by the request of such child's parent or parents, or those having guardianship or control of the child. The asylum shall not receive any child under this section until its parent or parents, or guardian, or person having the child in charge, shall agree with the officers of the asylum to supply sufficient funds, or such portion of the funds as the board of managers may agree upon, for the maintenance of the child in the asylum during such child's stay, and shall further agree to abide by all rules, bylaws, and requirements of the asylum. Should a child be admitted having a guardian lawfully appointed and qualified, who has money or property of such child under such guardian's control, such guardian shall be required to pay to the asylum such portion of the child's funds as the guardian may lawfully use, or the guardian may be authorized to use, for the child's support.

            The expenses of such asylum shall be met as follows, to wit: at the end of each fiscal year, each of the boards of managers shall make a statement of the financial condition of the asylum under its control, which shall especially show how much the necessary expenses of the asylum exceeded its income, and this excess shall be paid by the several counties that had a child or children in the asylum for any part of the fiscal year; each county shall pay so much per capita according to the number of children from that county in the asylum and the length of time that they were there. Of all these particulars, strict, accurate, and systematic accounts shall be kept by the officers of the board, and when the pro rata of any county shall be thus ascertained and a statement of the pro rata has been brought to the notice of the county mayor or financial agent of any such county, it shall be that person's duty forthwith to draw that person's warrant on the county trustee of the county in payment of the same. No county shall be liable to pay at a greater rate than fifty dollars ($50.00) per capita per annum for each child it had in the asylum, and no county shall pay any expenses of any children of that county unless the child or children be apprenticed to or sent to the asylum by the proper authorities, and by proper orders of the county legislative body.

           It is the intent of the general assembly to grant to blind individuals a priority in the establishment and operation of vending facilities on public property in this state. To that end, this part shall be liberally construed to give the blind individuals who are eligible for such priority the greatest possible opportunities to operate such vending facilities so that they may become self-supporting.

“(2)  ‘Central nonprofit agency' means the agency designated by the committee to facilitate the distribution, by direct allocation, subcontract or any other means, of orders from state government for commodities and services on the procurement list among the work centers for the blind, agencies serving individuals with severe disabilities, and other entities, and to assist the committee in administering the program described under this part; “(3)  ‘Certified commodities or services' means: “(A)  The commodities produced with ‘value added' through manufacturing, repackaging or assembly processes; “(B)  The services provided with ‘value added'; and “(C)  Commodities and services that have been recommended by the central nonprofit agency as suitable for procurement by any entity of state government pursuant to this part and that are certified pursuant to procedures approved by the state procurement commission as to quality, availability and fair market price;

        The state of Tennessee's practice of allowing nursing homes in Tennessee to certify less than all of their beds as available to medicaid patients is in violation of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite> et seq., and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>d.

       <p>
        The objective of the nursing home survey and certification process established by <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite>a(a)(33) is the protection of nursing home patients and enforcement of their statutory entitlement to high-quality care. Tennessee's limited bed certification policy subverts the accomplishment of this statutory purpose and transforms the survey and certification process into an instrument for denying patients' access to the medically necessary care to which they are entitled. Linton ex rel. Arnold v. Carney ex rel. Kimble, 779 F. Supp. 925, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19443 (M.D. Tenn. 1990), aff'd, Linton by Arnold v.

        The Social Security Act authorizes the expenditure of federal funds to enable states to furnish medical assistance to indigent individuals who are aged, blind, disabled, or members of families with dependent children. The state of Tennessee participates in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite>, for the purpose of operating its medicaid program pursuant to this chapter.

        The bureau of TennCare shall have the authority to develop and implement initiatives or program modifications to control the costs of the TennCare program to the extent permitted under federal law and the TennCare waiver. Such cost-saving measures may include, but are not limited to, the elimination of covered benefits or limitations on the scope, intensity, or duration of such benefits; implementation of cost sharing requirements for enrollees, including the medicaid population; increases in cost sharing requirements for the expansion population; enforcement of cost sharing requirements through denial of service for failure to meet co-payment requirements with alternative access to medically necessary care through established safety net providers; enforcement of collection of required co-payments by providers; reassignment of enrollees into different eligibility categories; restrictions on eligibility for non-mandatory medicaid or waiver expansion categories; and the elimination from TennCare eligibility of some or all of the non-mandatory medicaid or waiver expansion categories.

        The state of Tennessee's practice of allowing nursing homes in Tennessee to certify less than all of their beds as available to medicaid patients is in violation of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite> et seq., and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>d.

        The objective of the nursing home survey and certification process established by <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite>a(a)(33) is the protection of nursing home patients and enforcement of their statutory entitlement to high-quality care. Tennessee's limited bed certification policy subverts the accomplishment of this statutory purpose and transforms the survey and certification process into an instrument for denying patients' access to the medically necessary care to which they are entitled.

        The state of Tennessee's practice of allowing nursing homes in Tennessee to certify less than all of their beds as available to medicaid patients is in violation of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite> et seq., and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>d.

        The objective of the nursing home survey and certification process established by <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1396</cite>a(a)(33) is the protection of nursing home patients and enforcement of their statutory entitlement to high-quality care. Tennessee's limited bed certification policy subverts the accomplishment of this statutory purpose and transforms the survey and certification process into an instrument for denying patients' access to the medically necessary care to which they are entitled.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The TennCare bureau is directed to submit a state plan amendment to the centers for medicare and medicaid services that sets out a payment methodology for medicaid enrollees who are not also enrolled in medicare, consistent with provisions in § 6085 of the federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, regarding emergency services furnished by noncontract providers for managed care enrollees. The payment amount shall be the average contract rate that would apply under the state plan for general acute care hospitals. A tiered grouping of hospitals by size or services may be utilized to administer these payments. The payment methodology developed pursuant to this section shall be budget neutral for the state fiscal year 2007-2008 when compared to the actual experience for emergency services furnished by non-contract providers for medicaid managed care enrollees prior to January 1, 2007. It is the intent that this section only applies to the emergency services furnished by noncontract providers for medicaid managed care enrollees.

The plaintiff's attorney shall then inform the court regarding the results of such attorney's notice, if any.

After trial and at the time of the entry of the judgment or settlement in a case in which the state or any entity acting pursuant to subsection (e) has a subrogation interest under this section, it is the responsibility of the trial judge to calculate the amount of the subrogation interest and incorporate the court's findings concerning the subrogation interest in the final judgment or settlement. The gross amount of the subrogation interest shall be based upon the findings of the jury concerning medical expenses and evidence introduced after the trial about the total sum of moneys paid by the state or any entity acting pursuant to subsection (e) for medical expenses for injuries arising from the incident that is the basis of the action.

       If a person who previously had health insurance through their employer becomes uninsured due to bona fide closure of the employer's business or plant, such person, and the person's dependents shall automatically be eligible to enroll in the TennCare program at the expiration of the eighteen-month period authorized for continuing insurance coverage under COBRA. The department shall accept the application of such person prior to the expiration of the eighteen-month period so that health insurance through TennCare will begin immediately upon expiration of COBRA coverage and such person and the person's dependents will at no time be without health care coverage. However, nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted to provide TennCare coverage in situations where a business or plant declares bankruptcy or otherwise declares it is going out of business when the purpose, primary or otherwise, of such declaration is to establish TennCare coverage for its employees and the business or plant intends to reopen under the same or another identity with essentially the same ownership or management, or both. Reopening of a business with the same or another identity and essentially the same ownership or management, or both, shall be considered refutable evidence that the earlier closure was for the purpose of establishing TennCare eligibility for the business's employees. It is the legislative intent that this section be implemented only to the extent that it is determined to be consistent with the terms, conditions and eligibility criteria of the TennCare waiver as approved by the United States department of health and human services.

        Trial court erred in reversing TennCare's decision that an enrollee could receive necessary care for less cost at a hospital because the court applied the substantial and material standard to the enrollee's proof instead of the agency's decision, leading to an erroneous decision that the hospital could not meet the enrollee's needs, as (1) the enrollee's physician's contrary opinion was not entitled to controlling weight, since no objective medical evidence supported the opinion and the opinion significantly differed from TennCare's, (2) substantial and material evidence supported the decision, and the decision was not arbitrary and capricious, as the enrollee did not prove the hospital was not adequate to meet the enrollee's needs, and it was not a clear error in judgment for an administrative law judge to find the hospital could provide adequate care at a lower cost.

Such a showing shall be conducted in camera.

If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from such person's role in the violation of § 71-5-181, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action.

It is the intent of the general assembly that any funds expended pursuant to this part in the future shall be administered in conformity with the federal determination of budget neutrality that was made in 2002 with respect to coverage of uninsurable adults under the TennCare waiver and in conformity with any federal waiver that shall be obtained in the future.

                      Upon approval by the centers for medicare and medicaid services of the assessment imposed by this part, the bureau shall reimburse each ambulance provider with qualifying ground ambulance service medicaid transports in an amount calculated by the bureau. This calculation will be determined by the bureau's estimate of assessment collections and the resulting available program funding, less an annual amount of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) to offset medicaid administration expenses and an annual amount of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) to offset administrative expenses for the Tennessee Ambulance Services Association. If less than these amounts is needed to offset the administrative expenses, the bureau shall only deduct the amount needed. The bureau's estimate of assessment collections and the resulting program funding, netting out any amounts for offset administrative expenses, must be divided by the bureau's projected number of medicaid transports. The resulting amounts will be the additional payment amount made for each medicaid transport reported by the MCO's on a quarterly basis. This amount may change from quarter to quarter.

Failure of a covered hospital to receive a notice and return form, however, does not relieve a covered hospital from the obligation of timely payment. The bureau shall also post the return form on its website.

The bureau at its discretion may waive the penalty if the hospital establishes that it attempted to mail or electronically transfer payment to the state on or before the date the payment was due.

          The purpose of this part is to protect adults coming within this part from abuse, neglect or exploitation by requiring reporting of suspected cases by any person having cause to believe that such cases exist. It is intended that, as a result of such reports, the protective services of the state shall prevent further abuse, neglect or exploitation within the limitations set out in this part.

          It is recognized that adequate protection of adults will require the cooperation of many agencies and service providers in conjunction with the department of human services due to the often complex nature of the risks to this adult group, and that services to meet the needs of this group will not always be available in each community. However, it is desirable that the following services, as well as other services needed to meet the intent of this part, be available: medical care, mental health and developmental disabilities services, including in-home assessments and evaluations; in-home services including homemaker, home-health, chore, meals; emergency services including shelter; financial assistance; legal services; transportation; counseling; foster care; day care; respite care; and other services as needed to carry out the intent of this part.

        Nursing home's decision to admit and retain a resident did not constitute an infliction of abuse or neglect by the nursing home upon the decedent because no matter how plaintiff executor characterized the acts or omissions of the nursing home, its employees, or agents, the nursing home's decision to admit and retain the resident (who struck the decedent) did not constitute an infliction of physical pain, injury, or mental anguish (abuse or neglect) by the nursing home upon the decedent.

The judge or chancellor shall hear the complaint ahead of any other business then pending in court or in chambers.

In the event the party's last known address is unknown and cannot be ascertained upon diligent inquiry, the certificate of service shall so state. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.“(3)  If the adult and the respondent have been served with a copy of the petition and notice of hearing, an order of protection issued pursuant to this part after a hearing shall be in full force and effect against the respondent from the time it is entered, regardless of whether the respondent is present at the hearing.“(4)  A copy of any order of protection and any subsequent modifications or dismissal shall be issued to the petitioner, the respondent and the local law enforcement agencies having jurisdiction in the area where the adult resides. Upon receipt of the copy of the order of protection or dismissal from the issuing court or clerk's office, the local law enforcement agency shall take any necessary action to immediately transmit it to the national crime information center.“(5)  Upon violation of an order of protection entered pursuant to this section, a court may order any appropriate punishment or relief as provided for in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c03s36-3-610" target="_blank">36-3-610</a></cite>.“(e)  (1)  It is an offense to knowingly violate an order of protection issued pursuant to this section. A law enforcement officer may arrest a respondent who is the subject of an order of protection issued pursuant to this section with or without warrant.“(2)  In order to constitute a violation of this section:“(A)  The person must have received notice of the request for an order of protection;“(B)  The person must have had an opportunity to appear and be heard in connection with the order of protection or restraining order; and“(C)  The court must have made specific findings of fact in the order of protection that the person committed a violation of this part.“(3)  Any law enforcement officer shall arrest the respondent without a warrant if:“(A)  The officer has proper jurisdiction over the area in which the violation occurred;“(B)  The officer has reasonable cause to believe the respondent has violated or is in violation of an order for protection; and“(C)  The officer has verified that an order of protection is in effect against the respondent. If necessary, the law enforcement officer may verify the existence of an order of protection by telephone or radio communication with the appropriate law enforcement department.“(4)  Any person arrested for a violation of an order of protection entered pursuant to this section shall be treated as a person arrested for a violation of an order of protection issued pursuant to title 36, chapter 3, part 6.“(5)  A violation of this subsection (e) is a Class A misdemeanor, and any sentence imposed shall be served consecutively to the sentence for any other offense that is based in whole or in part on the same factual allegations, unless the sentencing judge or magistrate specifically orders the sentences for the offenses arising out of the same facts to be served concurrently.“(f)  Notwithstanding § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t71c06s71-6-102" target="_self">71-6-102</a></cite>, for purposes of this section:”(1)  ‘Abuse, neglect, or exploitation’ includes:“(A)  Abuse, neglect, and exploitation, as those terms are defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t71c06s71-6-102" target="_self">71-6-102</a></cite>; and“(B)  Neglect and financial exploitation, as those terms are defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c15s39-15-501" target="_blank">39-15-501</a></cite>; and“(2)  ‘Adult’ means an elderly adult or vulnerable adult, as those terms are defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c15s39-15-501" target="_blank">39-15-501</a></cite>.”
