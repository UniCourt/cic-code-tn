       <p>
        Though the question of the navigability of a stream is one of fact for the jury, still it is not error for the court to charge the statutes relating to the navigability and obstruction of streams, especially where it is clear that the stream in question is navigable, independently of statute. Railroad v. Ferguson, 105 Tenn. 552, 59 S.W. 343, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 106, 80 Am. St. Rep. 908 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        A river is navigable where occasionally, during good tides, it is used for steamboat navigation by light draft steamboats. Railroad v. Ferguson, 105 Tenn. 552, 59 S.W. 343, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 106, 80 Am. St. Rep. 908 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        A stream may be navigable in the technical sense, though its navigability has never been declared or recognized by statute, state or federal. Railroad v. Ferguson, 105 Tenn. 552, 59 S.W. 343, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 106, 80 Am. St. Rep. 908 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   The crucial test in determining the navigability of a stream is whether it is inherently and naturally navigable at the time of the determination, and not whether it is possible to be made so by artificial means, and a vast expenditure of money, at some remote period of the future. Webster v. Harris, 111 Tenn. 668, 69 S.W. 782, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 27, <cite class="lra">59 L.R.A. 324</cite> (1902), overruled in part, State ex rel. Cates v. West Tennessee Land Co., 127 Tenn. 575, 158 S.W. 746, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1913). But see State ex rel. Cates v. West Tennessee Land Co., 127 Tenn. 575, 158 S.W. 746, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1913), overruling the case of Webster v. Harris, supra, on this point, to the extent of holding that a stream of sufficient capacity in depth, width, and volume, to be legally navigable, is not rendered legally nonnavigable by stumps and trees that may be removed.

       </h4>
       <p>
        The English rule for determining whether a stream is navigable by the ebb and flow of the tide is not applicable to this state, and was never in force here. Elder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1845); Stuart v. Clark's Lessee, 32 Tenn. 9, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1852); Sigler v. State, 66 Tenn. 493, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 170 (1874); Miller v.

        The adoption and substitution of the new and more appropriate criterion of a navigable river does not change or affect the principles of the common law in any other respects, regulating and defining the respective rights of the public and of the riparian proprietors in rivers of whatever character.

        The ordinary low watermark may be defined to be the usual and common or ordinary stage of the river, when the volume of water is not increased by rains or freshets, nor diminished below such usual stage or volume by long continued drouth, to extreme low watermark. Nance v. Womack, 2 Shan. 202 (1877).

        <p>
   The term “navigable” has a technical or legal sense, to be distinguished from its common acceptation, and, when applied to streams in its technical or legal sense, means such as are capable, in the ordinary stage of the water, of navigation ascending and descending, by such vessels as are employed in the ordinary purposes of commerce, whether foreign or inland, and whether stream or sail vessels.

        Where the statute forbids the obstruction, without limitation or exception, the question in relation to the temporary obstruction of streams and highways by improvements, unloading, or other acts, and the question how far the rashness or carelessness of the party complaining would exonerate the other party, are not necessary to be considered or examined; but if the injury had been to the boat, hands or cargo by the obstruction, the doctrine of contributory negligence would be appropriate.

        If navigation is not impeded by the erection of a wharf boat, it can be no injury to the public, and therefore would not be a nuisance. If the public advantage greatly overbalances any slight inconvenience that may be produced by the wharf boat, it is no nuisance. When a great public benefit results from the abridgment of the right of passage, the great public benefit makes that abridgment no nuisance. Pilcher v. Hart, 20 Tenn. 524, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1840).

   There is an undoubted remedy at law for a nuisance, such as the overflow of a party's land by the erection and maintenance of a milldam, the diversion of a stream, or the impairment of a spring, but still, in cases where the injury is immediate and irreparable and constantly recurring, and where the remedy at law is imperfect, relief by perpetual injunction will be granted in chancery, without a preliminary trial and judgment at law, where the right is clear and the existence of the nuisance is manifest.

        The Clean Water Act precludes a citizen's suit only if the Administrator of the environmental protection agency (EPA) or a state is diligently prosecuting an enforcement action in a court of the United States, or a state. Thus, since neither the state's water quality control board (now the board of water quality, gas, and oil), nor the department of environment and conservation (TDEC), rise to the level of a federal or state court, the plaintiffs' citizen suit was not precluded, overruling Jones v. City of Lakeland, 175 F.3d 410, 1999 FED App. 0144P, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 7517 (6th Cir. 1999). Jones v. City of Lakeland, 224 F.3d 518, 2000 FED App. 265P, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 19013 (6th Cir.

        It was arbitrary and capricious for Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Control Board to dismiss a diversion option simply on the basis of possible delay because any delay occasioned by gauging a property owner's willingness to pay for the costs of diversion would be justified by future abatement of leachate discharges.

        Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Control Board's decision to dismiss a diversion option without fully considering its viability was arbitrary and capricious because the Board failed to fully consider the range of remedial options that were available and discussed at the hearing; it would be unreasonable to not consider the diversion plan given the threat the continued discharge of contaminants posed to the State's waters.

        Approval by the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Control Board of an amended consent order detailing necessary actions to be taken by a landfill permit holder to address the pollution issues of a creek and a lake was appropriate because the Board had the authority to approve the plan in the order to reduce the contamination stemming from a permit holder's landfill by diverting storm water away from the site and subsequently removing the waste from the landfill without the requirement of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.

If the operator files that request and also makes a specific request for an informal meeting with the commissioner to show cause why the stop work order should not have been issued, then the commissioner or, at the commissioner's option, the deputy or assistant commissioner, shall meet with the operator within three (3) working days after the hearing request is filed. Any modification or revocation of the stop work order shall be in writing. If the commissioner or the commissioner's designee upholds the stop work order, it shall remain in effect until resolution of the appeal or until the operator comes into compliance. If no request for hearing is made within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice, the stop work order becomes final and not subject to review.

   Compiler's Notes. Acts 2011, ch. 341, § 4 provided that notwithstanding any law to the contrary, where an owner of surface and mineral rights to real property enters into a contract for the conveyance of mineral rights in such property resulting in a severance of such interests, the parties to such conveyance shall identify the specific mineral interests to be conveyed to the purchaser of the mineral rights. The purchaser of the mineral interests shall identify such interests purchased by providing a deed reference number in accordance with §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c05s67-5-804ol1c" target="_blank">67-5-804(c)</a></cite> for the mineral interest with the property assessor in the county in which the interests are located as prescribed in this section. For the purposes of this section, “specific mineral interests” means only those minerals listed in the deed as contemplated by the parties. All rights to minerals not described in the deed shall remain with the surface owner. The provisions of this section shall apply to all contracts entered into on or after July 1, 2011, and shall not impair the obligation of any existing contract or be construed to direct courts in determining the intent of the parties who entered into a contract prior to such date.

The county clerk will make the assessment list or book substantially in the form used for state and county tax books, and when so made shall certify it to the trustee of the county, and it shall be the duty of the trustee of the county to proceed at once to collect the assessments within the dates prescribed by the court. The trustee shall pay the amount collected on the assessment to the county clerk, to be paid out on the cost and expenses under the orders of the court, and for collecting and paying over the assessments, the trustee will be allowed, as compensation for collecting and paying over the funds, two percent (2%) of the amount collected and paid over.

        This statute is not unconstitutional as arbitrary class legislation, because of the exemption of Reelfoot Lake from its operation, because such lake is a navigable water in the ordinary sense, with many public uses, giving the public an interest in its preservation so as to prevent its drainage. There is a sound and natural basis for such classification between it and the swamp lands of the state. State ex rel. Bigham v. Powers, 124 Tenn. 553, 137 S.W. 1110, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1911).

        In establishing any such district, all necessary lands may be appropriated as provided in this chapter, and a right-of-way as much as two hundred feet (200') wide may be so appropriated, if deemed necessary, for the situs and location of any ditch or drain, or for the location of a new route or channel for any natural watercourse for the whole way or parts of the way of its course. The natural bed of any watercourse in such district may, insofar as it may be utilized and necessary, be so appropriated to the end that such bed or channel may be cleaned out, deepened, or widened; but the provision in this section as to the width of such right-of-way shall not prevent the county court from ordering appropriated such other lands as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of such improvement district under this chapter.

The assessment may be made without notice, as taxes are assessed without notice in such cases; but publication shall be made in three (3) weekly newspapers published in the county where the proceeding is pending, if there are that number published in the county, otherwise in at least one (1) weekly newspaper, for two (2) consecutive weeks, notifying all parties, concerned in any way, of the date set for hearing the matter of assessment and apportionment by the court, when they may appear and be heard, if they desire. The last of the publications shall be at least five (5) days before the day set for the hearing, and the publication shall be in lieu and stead of notice personally served, but shall not give the names of the parties, but only a brief statement of the date and purpose of such hearing.

              Judgments against individual landowners are limited to assessments against the land of each particular individual within the drainage district, and such judgments can be enforced against no other property of the individual than such land. First Nat'l Bank v. Obion County, 3 F.2d 623, 1924 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1277 (D. Tenn. 1924).

              It was not the intention to make drainage assessments personal liabilities of the landowners. Grooms v. Board of Dirs., 167 Tenn. 589, 72 S.W.2d 772, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1934).

              The interest of a landowner in an unexpended balance of a fund, arising from additional assessments for drainage purposes, is his personal estate, and cannot be subjected by distraint, offset, or otherwise, to the payment of another assessment as to which he is delinquent. Grooms v. Board of Dirs., 167 Tenn. 589, 72 S.W.2d 772, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1934).

             <p>
              Plaintiff who paid special assessment was not barred from recovering pro rata share of unexpended balance of special assessment fund even though he had not paid original assessment on defaulted bonds. Grooms v. Board of Dirs., 167 Tenn. 589, 72 S.W.2d 772, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1934).

               The proceeding to enforce the collection of delinquent drainage assessments by sale of assessed land is purely statutory and the statute must be strictly followed. Patterson v. Gaddy, 28 Tenn. App. 487, 191 S.W.2d 556, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 81 (1944).

               Statutes providing for special assessments are in derogation of the common law and therefore to be strictly construed. No requirements of the statute can be disregarded. The prescribed procedure must be strictly pursued. Where this is not done the attempted sale is void. Johnson v. McKinney, 32 Tenn. App. 484, 222 S.W.2d 879, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 130 (1948).

               While there is no personal liability on the part of the owner of land for the payment of drainage assessments, the code provides that this shall be done by bills filed in the chancery court of the county in which the land lies and that they shall be in the name of the county for the use of the improvement district “and against the owners, if known, and if unknown, against them as such,” and moreover, that “such suits in chancery shall be proceeded with as other suits are in such court.” Johnson v.

               It is true that the proceedings are in rem. But the owners of the land and if known must nevertheless have notice of the suit and an opportunity to appear and defend it before a valid sale can be made.

               If the county legislative body determines that the estimated cost of reclamation and improvement of the district of land or levee or drainage district is greater than should be levied in a single year upon the lands benefited, it may fix the amount that shall be levied and collected each year, and may issue drainage bonds of the county, bearing interest payable semiannually, and may devote such bonds at par, with accrued interest, to the payment of the expenses and work as it progresses, or may sell the bonds at not less than par, with accrued interest, and devote the proceeds to such payment, and if, in the sale of the bonds, a premium is received, such premium shall be credited to the drainage fund. If the cost of such work exceeds the estimate, a new apportionment of the assessment may be made and levied and other bonds issued and sold in like manner, but in no case shall the bonds run longer than twenty (20) years.

   Compiler's Notes. The county court structure referred to in this chapter was abolished by the 1978 amendments to Tenn. Const. arts. VI and VII. Legislative functions formerly exercised by county courts now belong to county legislative bodies. Judicial functions now belong to general sessions, chancery, or circuit courts.

        The general assembly finds that as the population and demand for water resources grow, it is prudent to engage in planning for the future and to have an explicit mechanism in place to regulate proposals for the diversion of water from one river basin to another. By removing water from rivers, such inter-basin transfers raise issues of the protection of the public health, safety, welfare and the environment as the water is no longer available for use in the original stream. The primary purpose of this part is to allow regulation on the basis of the quantity of water in river basins. Although the common law addresses some of these concerns, it relies on after-the-fact litigation rather than a modern regulatory system. As this is remedial and police power legislation, all sections of this part shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose.

        <p>
         The general assembly recognizes that in other states the withdrawal of ground water has caused the lowering of the ground water table and that there is potential for ground water or surface water withdrawals to impact water uses in Tennessee. Therefore, it is necessary and prudent to institute a system of registration so that adequate information is obtained to document current demand for water and to project growth in that demand as applicable to this part.

      The governor, on behalf of this state, is hereby authorized to execute a compact in substantially the form set forth in this section, with the states of Alabama and Mississippi and/or with states contiguous with either of these states, and the general assembly hereby signifies its approval and ratification of such compact, which shall be executed in substantially the following form when the general assemblies or the chief legislative bodies of the states of Alabama and Mississippi have approved the state of Tennessee to become a party to the compact, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      TENNESSEE-TOMBIGBEE WATERWAY DEVELOPMENT COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to promote the development of a navigable waterway connecting the Tennessee and Tombigbee Rivers by way of the east fork of the Tombigbee River and Mackeys and Yellow Creeks so as to provide a nine-foot navigable channel from the junction of the Tombigbee and Warrior Rivers at Demopolis in the state of Alabama to the junction of Yellow Creek with the Tennessee River at Pickwick pool in the state of Mississippi and to establish a joint inter-state authority to assist in these efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE II
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall become effective immediately as to the states ratifying it whenever the states of Alabama and Mississippi have ratified it and congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE III
     </p>
     <p>
      The states which are parties to this compact (hereinafter referred to as “party states”) do hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as the “Authority”). The membership of the Authority shall consist of the governor of each party state and five (5) other citizens of each party state, to be appointed by the governor thereof. Each appointed member of the Authority shall be a citizen of that state who is interested in the promotion and development of waterways and water transportation. The appointive members of the Authority shall serve for terms of four (4) years each. Vacancies on the Authority shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The members of the Authority shall not be compensated, but each shall be entitled to actual expenses incurred in attending meetings, or incurred otherwise in the performance of the member's duties as a member of the Authority. The members of the Authority shall hold regular quarterly meetings and such special meetings as its business may require. They shall choose annually a chair and vice chair from among their members, and the chair shall rotate each year among the party states in order of their acceptance of this compact. The secretary of the Authority (hereinafter provided for) shall notify each member in writing of all meetings of the Authority in such a manner and under such rules and regulations as the Authority may prescribe. The Authority shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business; and the secretary shall keep a record of all its business, and shall furnish a copy thereof to each member of the Authority. It shall be the duty of the Authority, in general, to promote, encourage, and coordinate the efforts of the party states to secure the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway. Toward this end, the Authority shall have power to hold hearings; to conduct studies and surveys of all problems, benefits, and other matters associated with the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway, and to make reports thereon; to acquire, by gift or otherwise, and hold and dispose of such money and property as may be provided for the proper performance of their functions; to cooperate with other public or private groups, whether local, state, regional, or national, having an interest in waterways development; to formulate and execute plans and policies for emphasizing the purpose of this compact before the Congress of the United States and other appropriate officials and agencies of the United States; and to exercise such other powers as may be appropriate to enable it to accomplish its functions and duties in connection with the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway and to carry out the purposes of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE IV
     </p>
     <p>
      The Authority shall appoint a secretary, who shall be a person familiar with the nature, procedures, and significances of inland waterways development and the informational, educational, and publicity methods of stimulating general interest in such developments, and who shall be the compact administrator. The secretary's term of office shall be at the pleasure of the Authority and the secretary shall receive such compensation as the Authority shall prescribe. The secretary shall maintain custody of the Authority's books, records, and papers, which the secretary shall keep in the office of the Authority, and the secretary shall perform all functions and duties, and exercise all powers and authorities that may be delegated to the secretary by the Authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE V
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of any other waterway project, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency and a party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VI
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until the general assembly or governor of each or either state takes action to withdraw therefrom; provided that such withdrawal shall not become effective until six (6) months after the date of the action taken by the general assembly or governor. Notice of such action shall be given to the other party state or states by the secretary of state of the party state which takes such action.
