       Compiler's Notes. Provisions concerning Tipton County are derived from Private Acts of 1967, ch. 25, § 1; Acts 1965, ch. 318, § 1 had provided that training coon dogs by chasing raccoons was lawful from September 1 through February 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides that it shall be unlawful to train coon dogs by chasing coons in Hawkins County, except during the open season. However, ch. 320 of the Private Acts of 1982 provides that it “shall be unlawful for any person or firm to train coon dogs in Hawkins County during the period beginning March 1 and ending August 31 in each year,” subject to local approval. These provisions may be in conflict, depending on when the open season is set by the wildlife resources commission (now the fish and wildlife commission).

          <p>
           The delegation of authority to add to and delete species from Class I and Class II is constitutionally valid. Bean v. McWherter, 953 S.W.2d 197, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 436 (Tenn. 1997), rehearing denied, —S.W.3d—, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 509 (Tenn. 1997).
          </p>
          <p>
           Although there is an ambiguity as to the definition of Class II, since the Class III definition includes “all species not listed in other classes” and there is no list in Class II, the confusion does not render the section unconstitutionally vague; rather it is an ambiguity that requires the application of rules of construction. Bean v. McWherter, 24 S.W.3d 325, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 801 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999), review or rehearing denied, 24 S.W.3d 325, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 68 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).

The waters of Reelfoot Lake shall flow freely or naturally across the top of the twenty (20) stoplog gates or floodgates at the Reelfoot Lake spillway dam until the lake reaches an elevation of two hundred eighty-three and six-tenths feet (283.6') mean sea level. Once the lake exceeds such natural full pool level, the twenty (20) stoplog gates or floodgates at the Reelfoot Lake spillway dam shall be opened to bring the lake back to its natural full pool level of two hundred eighty-three and six-tenths feet (283.6') mean sea level. In bringing the lake back to its natural full pool level, the Reelfoot Lake Barr fishway, or radial water control spillway, may also be used.

       The water management plan established in subsection (c) shall remain in effect until a fifty (50) year comprehensive management plan for Reelfoot Lake is developed by the executive director of the agency and until enactment of such legislation as shall be necessary to implement such management plan.

        When any person is arrested for any violation of the wildlife laws, it is the duty of the arresting officer making or causing the arrest to take the person so arrested before a court of general sessions for trial, in the county where the offense was committed. If before such court of general sessions, the accused is found guilty of any offense punishable by a fine of fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, that person shall have the right to appeal to the circuit or criminal court having jurisdiction of such appeals, upon giving security for the amount of the fine and imposed costs. In the cases of offenses punishable by a fine of more than fifty dollars ($50.00) or by imprisonment, then the magistrate or court of general sessions is governed by the general laws applicable to such offenses.

        If the court were to apply the Tennessee recreational use statute, the wife of a drowning victim and the owners of a fishing boat the victim was in would be barred from pursuing federal maritime causes of action for negligence; this was precisely the situation in which a state law should not be applied, and accordingly the Tennessee recreational use statute could not be applied in that federal admiralty case.

        In an action brought by the wife of a drowning victim and counterclaims brought by the owners of a fishing boat the victim was in, the Tennessee recreational use statute could not be applied because its language is limited to causes of action arising from a failure to keep the premises safe, or a failure to warn; rather the allegations were that defendant Tennessee Valley Authority's agents were negligent in the operation of a tug boat. Matheny v. TVA, 503 F. Supp. 2d 917, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59992 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 15, 2007).

        Although the provisions of the Tennessee recreational use statute governed property owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), it did not apply to landowners'  suit because they did not bring claims for injury or damage that occurred in a recreational activity, but rather their claims against the TVA concerned the impact of ash from a coal ash spill on their persons, property, and their use and enjoyment of those properties.

   While the language of exception (3) in this section is not unambiguous, it cannot be construed so as to create a duty on a landowner's part to all persons who would have had the status of invitee at common law. To do so would nullify the clear intent of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t70c07s70-7-102" target="_self">70-7-102</a></cite> to remove the duty of care from the landowner. Shaver v.

        Drafters did not intend exceptions to disallow immunity for landowners where an injury results from the negligent act of a person to whom permission to use the premises was granted. Cagle v. United States, 937 F.2d 1073, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 13195 (6th Cir. 1991).

        Army's failure to properly maintain warning signs in an area it considered the south impact area to be a “never cross” type area due to the potentially lethal unexploded duds known to be in the area constituted gross negligence.

        Landowner's failure to place a “no trespassing” sign at the entrance of the caves where the decedent fell and was killed did not constitute gross negligence, as the failure to place the sign did not constitute a conscious indifference to consequences on the part of the landowner.

However, nothing in this part shall be construed to limit the rights of private property owners to take rare plants from their own lands or to manage their lands for agriculture, forestry, development or any other lawful purpose.

     <p>
      The number of off-highway vehicle users in the state is increasing and is growing as a recognized recreational activity while the number of recreational sites is rapidly declining. In the absence of a program to manage off-highway vehicle (OHV) use, a number of consequences are accruing to the state, including environmental damage and loss of economic prospects. Therefore, the general assembly finds the need to manage OHVs to maximize economic and recreational opportunities, to protect the environment of this state, and to ensure that adequate revenue is generated for such purpose.
