        The failure to read and sign the minutes each morning in open court, and the signing of the same at chambers, or in another town or place, after the court has adjourned, is severely reprehended and deprecated, as likely to result in surreptitious entries and evil practices.

        Minutes are indigenous to courts of record, and when signed by a trial judge they become the highest evidence of what has been done in the court. Ray v. State, 577 S.W.2d 681, 1978 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 280 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978).

        The minutes, signed as required by this statute, and thus authenticated, are made the highest evidence of what was done in court; and, so far as they are records of judicial proceedings, they import absolute verity, and are conclusive unless attacked for fraud. Moore v. State, 50 Tenn. 493, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1871); Conway v. Brown, 52 Tenn. 237, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 255 (1871); Dyer v. State, 79 Tenn. 509, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1883); Chrisman v.

        The failure of a judge, through inadvertence or accident, to sign the minutes of the court for the day on which a judgment was recovered, does not invalidate the judgment, the provisions of the statute on this subject being directory. Jackson v. Jackson, 3 Shan. 18 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        The minutes of records of courts are generally required to be authenticated by the signature of the judge, but failure of the judge to sign the record as directed by statute does not make the judgment a nullity; it is at most irregular and erroneous, but not void.

        A bid at a master's sale continues as a mere offer until the court rejects it or accepts it. But the purchaser does not become the owner of the legal title, unless the decree divests and vests title, or unless a deed is made by the master pursuant to a decree ordering him so to do, or unless, on being so ordered, the master fails to make the deed within a reasonable time, in which latter event, the title will vest in the purchaser by the mere lapse of such reasonable time.

        Where decree of court vested title in purchaser but before the deeds were executed by the clerk, the purchaser asked the court to make an order directing the clerk to execute the deeds to him and his wife, which order was entered on the minutes and the deeds were so executed, such procedure vested title in the purchaser and his wife as tenants by the entireties.

       Attorney General Opinions. In allowing an officer to use an electronic signature, a detailed proposal for the issuance of an arrest warrant conformed with the statutory provision giving electronic signatures the same force and effect as written signatures in affidavits of complaint and arrest warrants; therefore, the resulting one-page arrest warrant with the electronic signature of the affiant and two original signatures of the judicial commissioner constituted a valid charging instrument, OAG 00-124 (8/7/00).
      </p>
      <p>
       If an affiant personally appears before a judicial commissioner to swear to the allegations of the arrest warrant and signs the warrant using an electronic signature pad, the resulting arrest warrant bearing the electronic signature constitutes a valid charging instrument, OAG 00-124 (8/7/00).

       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or rule of court to the contrary, when an original civil action, an appeal from the judgment of a court of general sessions, or a petition for review of a final decision in a contested case under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, is filed in a state or county court of record or a general sessions court and such court determines that it lacks jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer the action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was originally filed. Upon such a transfer, the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been originally filed in the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in the court from which it was transferred.

        In a prison inmate's suit against the department of corrections challenging a disciplinary decision against him, dismissal of the inmate's suit was proper as T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.41.html#t41c21s41-21-803" target="_blank">41-21-803</a></cite> expressly provided that the inmate's action be brought in the county in which the correctional facility was located, and he failed to do so; furthermore, the chancellor applied the correct legal standard, and her discretionary determination for not transferring the case to the proper venue was based upon and a consequence of the inmate's previous acts and omissions. Jones v. Tenn. Dep't of Corr., — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 273 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2007), overruled, Womack v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 448 S.W.3d 362, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 659 (Tenn.

        Prison inmate's certiorari petition seeking judicial review of a disciplinary proceeding, which petition was filed in a county other than that of the prison, was properly dismissed because the venue requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.41.html#t41c21s41-21-803" target="_blank">41-21-803</a></cite> was jurisdictional, and the petition also had several procedural defects under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c08s27-8-104ol1a" target="_blank">27-8-104(a)</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c08s27-8-106" target="_blank">27-8-106</a></cite>, so that neither the interests of justice nor the principles of judicial economy would be served by transferring the case to the proper county.

        Appellate court denied defendant's request that his habeas corpus petition be treated as one for postconviction relief and that the appellate court order the Davidson county court to transfer the matter to the Maury county criminal court to proceed as if the petition was for postconviction relief, because without express authority, it would not order a transfer; the appellate court was not persuaded that T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c01s16-1-116" target="_self">16-1-116</a></cite> applied, as postconviction proceedings were governed specifically by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c30s40-30-101" target="_blank">40-30-101</a></cite> et seq., and habeas corpus actions were governed specifically by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c21s29-21-119" target="_blank">29-21-119</a></cite>.

        Chancery court erred in granting summary judgment and dismissing an employee's retaliatory discharge case rather than granting the public employer's motion to transfer because the employer raised a jurisdictional objection and, therefore, transfer was mandated.

          Each criminal case shall be assigned a unique docket number. A criminal case shall be defined and reported as a single charge or set of charges arising out of a single incident concerning a single defendant in one (1) court proceeding. An incident shall be all criminal activity occurring on the same date. A court proceeding refers to a single level of court, such as general sessions or circuit. An appeal, probation revocation, or other post-judgment proceeding shall be considered a separate case. This definition shall not alter the practice in the Tennessee rules of criminal procedure dealing with joinder and severance of criminal cases. In addition, in courts of record, multiple incidents shall be counted as a single case when the charges are of a related nature and it is the district attorney general's intention that all of the charges be handled in the same court proceeding pursuant to a single indictment.

A unique docket number will be assigned to a civil case upon filing.

Once a civil case has been disposed and further actions occur on the case, the original case will be reopened using the same docket number under which it was originally filed and is subject to additional court costs. All subsequent motions, petitions, claims, counterclaims or proceedings relating to the reopened case will be handled under the one reopened case docket number until disposed. Any subsequent re-openings will still use the original docket number, but will be counted by the administrative office of the courts as a new case for case-reporting purposes and are subject to additional court costs.

       Amendments. The 2013 amendment by ch. 236  substituted “the chairs of the civil justice committee of the house of representatives and the judiciary committee of the senate” for “the chairs of the judiciary committees of the house of representatives and the senate” in the last sentence of (a)(5).

      </p>
      <p>
       The 2014 amendment rewrote (a)(1) which read: “Each criminal case shall be assigned a unique docket number. A criminal case in a court of record, except juvenile court, shall be defined and reported as a single charge or set of charges arising out of a single incident involving the same victim or victims concerning a defendant in one (1) court proceeding. An incident shall be all criminal activity occurring within a twenty-four-hour period. A court proceeding refers to a single level of court, such as general sessions, circuit, appeals or supreme court. An appeal, probation revocation, or other post-judgment proceeding shall be considered a separate case. This definition shall not alter the practice in the Tennessee rules of criminal procedure dealing with joinder and severance of criminal cases. Charges of a related nature shall be defined as charges against a single defendant that may have more than one (1) victim and that are similar, such as, but not limited to, burglaries, drug offenses or serial rape. Worthless check cases shall be defined and reported as all worthless checks filed by the same affiant against the same defendant within a twenty-four-hour period with each check counted as a separate charge. District attorneys general shall treat multiple incidents as a single incident for purposes of this subdivision (a)(1) when the charges are of a related nature and it is the district attorney general's intention that all of the charges be handled in the same court proceeding. If a case has more than one (1) charge or count, then the administrative office of the courts shall count the case according to the highest class of charge or count at the time of filing or disposition for the weighted caseload study based on the formula set out in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c02s16-2-513ol1a" target="_self">16-2-513(a)</a></cite>;”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2018 amendment substituted “The clerks of courts,” for “The clerks of those courts unable to make direct reports to the federal bureau of investigation-NICS index” in (a)(6)(B).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2019 amendment by ch. 345 substituted “judiciary” for “civil justice” preceding “committee of the house” in (a)(5) and (a)(6)(D).

      <p>
       The 2019 amendment by ch. 420 deleted “to the judicial council and” following “Any periods of noncompliance will also be reported in the annual report” in (a)(5).

        There is no emergency warranting transfer of hearing on application of parties wishing to force sale of realty during financial distress of the community where the appellees are protected by injunction bond and the property is held by a receiver appointed by the court.

        The exercise of the authority conferred by this section should be confined to “emergency causes,” or those where great or irreparable injury or wrong might result from a delay. State v. Meux, 166 Tenn. 286, 61 S.W.2d 974, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1933).

        A quo warranto proceeding by a new road commission, created under a law impliedly repealing the former law, against the commission created under the former law to determine which of the two was entitled to administer the road law is not an “emergency cause” within the meaning of this section.

          </p>
          <p>
           Article II, § 24 of the Constitution of Tennessee provides, in part, that:
          </p>
          <p>
           Any law requiring the expenditure of state funds shall be null and void unless, during the session in which the act receives final passage, an appropriation is made for the estimated first year's funding.
          </p>
          <p>

          1. Nature of Jurisdiction.
         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         The jurisdiction is appellate only, with such powers as, though not appellate, are absolutely necessary in carrying out and completing the jurisdiction given, such as forfeited recognizances, failure of officers to return process, or false returns, motions against them, etc. Miller v. Conlee, 37 Tenn. 432, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1858); Memphis v. Halsey, 59 Tenn. 210, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1873); State ex rel. Kain v. Hall, 65 Tenn. 3, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 290 (1873); State v. Wilson, 70 Tenn. 204, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1879); Dodds v. Duncan, 80 Tenn. 731, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1884); State use of Fletcher v. Gannaway, 84 Tenn. 124, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 122 (1885).
        </p>
        <p>
         This last clause, “but it may possess such other jurisdiction as is now conferred by law upon the present supreme court,” confers power to adopt such proceedings, issue such process, and try such facts as might become necessary to carry out and perfect its own judgments and decrees in cases before it by appeal, or writ of error, such as the issuance of scire facias and capias upon forfeited bonds or recognizances, motions against sheriffs for nonreturn of process. Jurisdiction of this character is all that was intended to be conferred by that provision. State v. Bank of East Tennessee, 37 Tenn. 573, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1858); Ward v. Thomas, 42 Tenn. 565, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (1865); Motion Against Curry, 59 Tenn. 51, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1873). See also Bank of Tennessee v. Cannon, 49 Tenn. 428, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1871).
        </p>
        <p>
         The jurisdiction of the supreme court is appellate only. Memphis S. R. Co. v. Byrne, 119 Tenn. 278, 104 S.W. 460, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1907).
        </p>
        <p>
         The power of the supreme court exists in every case that reaches the court through the exercise of its appellate power, as, for example, by the writ of certiorari, as well as by writ of error or appeal, or appeal in the nature of a writ of error; also to proceedings originating in the court in aid and enforcement of its appellate power at every stage, from their inception in any given controversy to their completion in the full execution of its final judgments and decrees. State ex rel. Conner v. Herbert, 127 Tenn. 220, 154 S.W. 957, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1912).
        </p>
        <p>
         Supreme court is a court of appellate jurisdiction only and without jurisdiction to hear proof on petition to set aside decrees and orders of chancery court and Court of Appeals. Pierce v. Tharp, 224 Tenn. 328, 455 S.W.2d 145, 1970 Tenn. LEXIS 330 (1970), rehearing denied, 224 Tenn. 339, 457 S.W.2d 529 (1970), cert. denied, McKown v.

        <p>
         If an inferior judge improperly excludes an attorney from practice, and will not permit anything to be entered of record from which an appeal may be taken, and refuses to sign a proper bill of exceptions, the supreme court has jurisdiction, by mandamus, to compel him to do so, and he will be liable for costs.

         Writ of mandamus compelling the signing of bill of exceptions will only be granted when there has been a clear case of abuse of discretion by the judge. Alexander v. State, 82 Tenn. 88, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1884); State v. Brockwell, 84 Tenn. 683, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1886).
        </p>
        <p>
         The inferior judge will not be compelled to sign a particular bill of exceptions, when he asserts upon his oath its incorrectness, and its correctness is doubtful; but if the particular bill is clearly correct, he would be compelled to sign it.

        <p>
         A judgment rendered in the supreme court, on motion, without notice, upon a sheriff's official bond, for the nonreturn of an execution, where his term of office expired before the return day, is void, and, it being regular upon its face, the remedy is by bill in chancery court to have it declared void.

        <p>
         Where the satisfaction of a judgment of the supreme court is set aside by it on the ex parte application of the judgment debtor suppressing a material fact, the disclosure of which would have defeated the application, the chancery court has jurisdiction to enjoin the execution of the judgment, and the ex parte action of supreme court is not res judicata.

         The supreme court has authority to issue all writs and process necessary for the exercise and enforcement of its jurisdiction and to protect its jurisdiction. To prevent such jurisdiction from being trifled with or rendered ineffectual, it may consider matters transpiring after a cause is heard in the lower court. Cockrill v. Peoples Sav.

Having taken jurisdiction of the cause, the court had full authority, under this section, by way of exercising and enforcing its own jurisdiction to stay proceedings under a procedendo irregularly issued from the court of appeals.

         In a felony case there is no requirement that the accused confined in the penitentiary, pending his appeal, or at large on bond be present in the supreme court when his case is heard or decided, because Tenn. Const., art. I, § 9, requiring his presence “in all criminal prosecutions,” applies only to a trial prosecuted by the state in the trial court, which does not include a review on appeal or writ of error, which is a proceeding brought by the accused himself.

         The accused appealing from a conviction of a felony who is bonded to appear in court must be present in cases where judgment is affirmed on appeal, either at the time or later, in order that actual custody may be taken of him, and that he may be transported to the penitentiary; and in case of reversal and remandment for new trial, he must attend to give bond or recognizance, unless permitted by order of the court to surrender to the sheriff of the trial court and give bond there, and only under very special circumstances will the court reverse a judgment in a felony case where the accused is under bond without requiring his presence in court.

         Where term of office of clerk and master of chancery court had not expired when his successor was appointed, and the latter procured a warrant directing the seizure of official books and papers, on application for a writ of error from the judgment on which the warrant issued, a supersedeas would issue, though the warrant has been fully executed, with a direction to restore the books and papers, that being the only method for preserving the rights of the parties as they were before the making of the order.

         When this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c03s16-3-209" target="_self">16-3-209</a></cite> are read together their meaning is unquestionably this: That appeals should generally be taken to the next term succeeding the time at which an appeal is granted, and that they shall stand for hearing at that succeeding term; but that an appellant has the option to appeal to the present or current term of the court and may have a hearing at that term upon giving five days' notice of that desire to his adversary.

         Although appeals should generally be taken to the next term succeeding the time at which an appeal is granted, and they shall stand for hearing at that succeeding term, but an appellant has the option to appeal to the present or current term of the court and may have a hearing at that term upon giving five days' notice of that desire to his adversary.

         Appeal was dismissed for delay in filing assignments of error and brief where appellant did not file same until three days before hearing date though notified by clerk of hearing date 53 days prior thereto.

        <p>
         If after the record is filed the clerk sets the case for hearing at the current term instead of the succeeding term and counsel fails to object to the hearing at that time, after proper notice is given by the clerk, counsel will be considered as having waived the right to object to the setting at the current term and will be required to comply with the rules of court concerning filing of assignments of error. Grissom v. H. K. Ferguson Co., 205 Tenn. 580, 329 S.W.2d 816, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 396 (1959).
        </p>
        <p>
         If appeal was filed and case was set for hearing in the same term but assignments of error were not filed within the time required by supreme court rule, fact that after motion of adversary to dismiss for failure to properly file the appellant filed the record for a writ of error and executed and filed bond with the clerk and re-filed the assignments of error did not cure the failure to file within the required time in the first instance.

         The court has the power, by an order signed by three (3) of its members and forwarded to the clerk at any of the places where its sessions are required to be held, to open any term of the court at such place, without the attendance of the judges of the court, and likewise an order of adjournment or any other order, judgment or decree, signed by three (3) of the judges, may be entered in the absence of the members of the court. The signed orders shall be entered by the clerk on the minutes of the court, and shall have the effect of signed minute orders from the time received and filed by the clerk. The signed orders shall be filed and preserved by the clerk receiving them, until compared with the minutes by the court, and the minutes shall be examined and signed by the court at least once every thirty (30) days.

           The supreme court has the power to adopt all rules and orders necessary and proper to make effective its appellate jurisdiction and to enforce its judgments, and it has the power to make and establish a rule, when a case arises to which there is no rule then in use that applies.

           Rule of the supreme court requiring of appellants assignments of error (85 Tenn. 757, appendix) was held to be a reasonable rule of practice. Denton v.

           Chancery court erred in exercising subject matter jurisdiction over a bail bond company's action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment declaring proposed Local Rules of Practice and Procedure for Bail Bond Companies unenforceable, unconstitutional, and in violation of the law because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an action for declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the validity of local rules of the criminal court. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn. Mar. 22, 2016).
          </p>
          <p>
           Because a bail bond company's underlying claim for injunctive relief regarding Local Rules of Practice and Procedure for Bail Bond Companies could not be brought in chancery court, the chancery court could not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment aspect of the case either; the courts should not assume that subject matter jurisdiction existed based on the fact that the issue was not addressed. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn. Mar. 22, 2016).
          </p>
          <p>
           To allow the chancery court to review the validity or enjoin the enforcement of the local rules of the criminal court would interfere with the inherent power of the criminal court to administer its affairs and impose reasonable regulations regarding the making of bonds; the statutes and rules do not authorize chancery court review of the local rules of the criminal court. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn.

           The trial courts of the state have authority to make reasonable rules of practice applicable to such courts including rules as to motions for new trials so long as such rules are not inconsistent with the law.

           Because a bail bond company's underlying claim for injunctive relief regarding Local Rules of Practice and Procedure for Bail Bond Companies could not be brought in chancery court, the chancery court could not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment aspect of the case either; the courts should not assume that subject matter jurisdiction existed based on the fact that the issue was not addressed. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn.

           To allow the chancery court to review the validity or enjoin the enforcement of the local rules of the criminal court would interfere with the inherent power of the criminal court to administer its affairs and impose reasonable regulations regarding the making of bonds; the statutes and rules do not authorize chancery court review of the local rules of the criminal court. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn.

           Chancery court erred in exercising subject matter jurisdiction over a bail bond company's action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment declaring proposed Local Rules of Practice and Procedure for Bail Bond Companies unenforceable, unconstitutional, and in violation of the law because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an action for declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the validity of local rules of the criminal court.

           Proposed legislation that gives the Tennessee Supreme Court the authority to appoint any former judge or justice who has at least one year of judicial service to serve as “a senior judge to hear complex commercial disputes” raises significant constitutional concerns. Unlike existing law, the proposed legislation would permit a former judge who has minimal judicial experience and who has never won a judicial election to serve in a judicial capacity. And the appointment would not be temporary but would be for a four-year term, renewable without limitation at the discretion of the Supreme Court. The election requirement of article VI, section 4 is not absolute, as demonstrated by the several provisions that allow unelected individuals to exercise judicial authority for a limited time or limited purpose, but the proposed legislation would undermine the election requirement to an extent not provided in existing law.  However, the proposed legislation that would allow the Supreme Court to transfer complex commercial cases from the assigned trial court judge to a senior business judge does itself not raise constitutional concerns. It constitutes a specific grant of authority to transfer cases in furtherance of the Supreme Court’s existing supervisory authority. OAG 18-14, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 15 (3/23/2018).

            Supreme court under its supervisory jurisdiction will not permit an abuse of legal process for the purpose of harassment or delay and will not permit a litigant to deliberately harass public officials or delay the transaction of public business.

            As the supreme court may require more of its officers than the legislature may prescribe in the exercise of its public power, former § 29-110, which provided that the license to practice law was not subject to membership in any organization, was an unconstitutional interference with the court's power, violating Tenn. Const., art. II, §§ 1, 2, and subdivisions (5) and (6) of this section. Petition of Tennessee Bar Asso., 532 S.W.2d 224, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 609 (Tenn. 1975).

            Inclusion of funds in the Tennessee Judicial Department's budget for the purpose of compensating trial judge secretarial assistants does not give rise to an implied annual contract of employment for any particular trial judge secretarial assistant; moreover, the role of the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) in performing human resources functions for the Judicial Department does not give rise to implied contracts between the AOC and Judicial Department employees.

       The purpose of the creation of an intermediate appellate court was to lighten the labors of the supreme court by giving to the latter the benefit of a finding of facts, in a proper case, by the court of appeals on all material issues in equity cases. This purpose is demonstrated by the legislative history throughout 30 years. Hibbett v. Pruitt, 162 Tenn. 285, 36 S.W.2d 897, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 89 (1931).

        1. Residency Requirements.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Statutes creating the intermediate courts of appeal distinguish between a residency requirement for a candidate for office and residence of voters for purposes of voting in exactly the same way as does the Constitution in establishing the Supreme Court; in both instances, a judicial candidate can be required to live in a certain geographic area as a qualification for office, but still be elected statewide without regard to geographic area in which the qualified voters reside. Hooker v. Haslam, 437 S.W.3d 409, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since judges of intermediate appellate courts are not assigned to any district or circuit, voting by district or circuit is not required, and this is in no way changed by the requirement that no more than four of the 12 judges on each intermediate appellate court may reside in any one of three grand divisions of Tennessee; a district is a political subdivision, and while a district usually connotes a subunit of a county and may be subject to reconfiguration, a grand division refers to one of three permanently defined, large umbrella units, each composed of many counties and districts, and a grand division is not a district within the meaning of the Constitution. Hooker v. Haslam, 437 S.W.3d 409, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a grand division were deemed to be a district, the statutory limitation on residence by grand division would still be irrelevant, since the judges of the intermediate appellate courts are not assigned to any grand division; the statutory residence requirement by grand division is merely a limiting qualification for the office of intermediate appellate judge, and it is not a limitation on voting. Hooker v. Haslam, 437 S.W.3d 409, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014).

      <p>
       The court of appeals is one of review and of final determination, except on petition for certiorari presenting: (1) Errors of law; (2) Errors of fact where there is a nonconcurrence between the trial court and the court of appeals; or (3) Concurrence without any evidence to support the conclusion. Bray v. Blue Ridge Lumber Co., 154 Tenn. 342, 289 S.W. 504, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of court of appeals is not limited to questions of fact only. Gormany v. Ryan, 154 Tenn. 432, 289 S.W. 497, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 139 (1926); Garrett v. Garrett, 156 Tenn. 253, 300 S.W. 9, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers of the supreme court, under the constitution and statutes, are broader than the powers conferred on the court of appeals by the statutes of its creation. Growers Warehousing Corp. v. W. E. Sawyer Tobacco Co., 5 Tenn. App. 619, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where appeal of will contest was granted to all contestants but only one of them perfected an appeal, the court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the case as fully as if all the contestants had perfected the appeal granted. Druen v. Hudson, 17 Tenn. App. 428, 68 S.W.2d 146, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction only and cannot exercise original jurisdiction to determine the validity of a client's agreement, giving his attorney a lien on a fund for services in protecting the fund from claim of client's adversary where the question was not presented below. John Weis, Inc. v. Reed, 22 Tenn. App. 90, 118 S.W.2d 677, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 9 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the court of appeals being appellate only, such court only reviews the judgment of trial court in disposing of a motion for a new trial and not the grounds themselves, originally, before they were passed upon by the trial judge. Standard Oil Co. v. Naramore, 30 Tenn. App. 430, 207 S.W.2d 7, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the court of appeals is appellate only, and the court of appeals can only consider such matters as were brought to the attention of the chancellor, and acted upon or pretermitted by him. Clement v. Nichols, 186 Tenn. 235, 209 S.W.2d 23, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 542 (1948); Loftis v. Stuyvesant Ins. Co., 54 Tenn. App. 371, 390 S.W.2d 722, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 158 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals can only consider such matters as were brought to the attention of the trial court and acted upon or permitted by the trial court. Irvin v. Binkley, 577 S.W.2d 677, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 276 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court of appeals has intermediate appellate jurisdiction of appeals from orders relating to suits for negligence even though the existence or nonexistence of worker's compensation coverage may affect the right to recover for negligence. Hill v. King, 663 S.W.2d 435, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 650 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment awarding a landlord possession of the property and for unpaid rent against a tenant was affirmed because neither a transcript of the proceedings nor a statement of the evidence was filed and the pleadings filed contained minimal information; without a complete record or sufficient statement of the evidence, the appellate court assumed the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment pursuant to T.R.A.P. 13(d). The Court of Appeals of Tennessee had appellate jurisdiction only, and its power to review was limited to those factual and legal issues for which an adequate legal record had been preserved. Reid v. Reid, 388 S.W.3d 292, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 554 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 846 (Tenn. Nov. 20, 2012).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The term “all civil cases” does not include matters submitted to the juvenile and domestic relations courts of Knox County and were not intended to give the court of appeals jurisdiction of appeals coming up from such additional tribunals. In re Scalf's Adoption, 176 Tenn. 581, 144 S.W.2d 772, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prosecution for an act violating a city ordinance is a civil, not a criminal proceeding, even though such act be denounced by ordinance as a “misdemeanor” and be also an offense against state law so that appeal is to the court of appeals unless the case falls within one of the exceptions enumerated in this section. O'Dell v. Knoxville, 214 Tenn. 237, 379 S.W.2d 756, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 469 (1964), overruled, City of Chattanooga v. Davis, 54 S.W.3d 248, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 635 (Tenn. 2001).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction on appeal as between the appellate courts turns on the method of procedure in the trial court, whether or not the issues have been there presented and considered by such method as do not call for a consideration, review or determination of questions of fact. Gormany v. Ryan, 154 Tenn. 432, 289 S.W. 497, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 139 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The respective jurisdictions depend upon the method of trial in the lower court, and not upon the circumstance that, after appeal, no disputed fact remains open. Gormany v.

       The jurisdiction of the supreme court is not saved by the circumstance that no question of fact is involved on the appeal. Jurisdiction on appeal depends on the method adopted in the trial court, and unless that method precludes a determination of the facts in that court, the appeal is properly to the court of appeals.

       Whenever good faith constitutional questions are involved which may be determinative, although nonconstitutional questions are also presented, the jurisdiction is exclusively in the supreme court. Nashville v. Dad's Auto Accessories, Inc., 154 Tenn. 194, 285 S.W. 52, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1926), dismissed, Dad's Auto Accessories v. Nashville, <cite class="s_court">47 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutionality of statute relied upon was properly questioned for first time on appeal in error to court of appeals, and, question being debatable, and not frivolous, cause was transferred to supreme court. Mattel v. Clark Hardware Co., 3 Tenn. App. 379, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 111 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       All cases involving constitutional questions are appealable to the supreme court only. Howard & Herrin v. Nashville, C. & S. L. R. Co., 3 Tenn. App. 174, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 84 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926); State v. Monday, 7 Tenn. App. 257, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 37 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the constitutional question is theoretical and wholly insufficient to determine the cause on appeal, the court of appeals will have jurisdiction. Williams v. Realty Dev. Co., 161 Tenn. 451, 33 S.W.2d 64, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       If an act whose constitutionality is questioned may be construed as not applicable to the particular case, the constitutional question becomes immaterial and the court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction. Western Auto. Casualty Co. v. Burnell, 17 Tenn. App. 687, 71 S.W.2d 474, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exception as to constitutional questions refers to rights dependent upon the constitutionality of statutes and ordinances, or the denial of privileges expressly guaranteed by the Constitution and, the constitutional questions must be substantial and not incidental to the cause of action. Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Pharr, 183 Tenn. 658, 194 S.W.2d 486, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 249 (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere insistence that there is no evidence upon which the public utilities commission could base a legal and just conclusion is not sufficient to raise a constitutional question as to the taking of property without due process, and thus bring the case under the exception of this section. Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Pharr, 183 Tenn. 658, 194 S.W.2d 486, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 249 (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the statute jurisdiction of constitutional questions lies exclusively in the supreme court, but in order to deprive the court of appeals of jurisdiction on that account the constitutional question must be substantial and not incidental. Memphis &amp; Shelby County Bar Ass'n v. Aspero, 35 Tenn. App. 9, 242 S.W.2d 319, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 164 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950), cert. denied, Aspero v. Memphis &amp; S.

       If constitutionality of statute is sole determinative question in litigation jurisdiction of appeal is in supreme court, but where appellee questions appellant's right to attack the act, this adds another question to determine and court of appeals will resolve the doubt in favor of their jurisdiction.

       The supreme court has jurisdiction of all cases which have been finally determined in the lower courts on demurrer or other method not involving a review or determination of the facts, or in which all the facts have been stipulated, and it may award writs of certiorari and supersedeas, where there is no material controversy over the facts as presented by the pleadings or bill and answer.

      </p>

       Court of appeals is not without jurisdiction to review decree of chancery court based upon undisputed facts merely because such a review would involve only questions of law. Lincoln County Bank v. Maddox, 21 Tenn. App. 648, 114 S.W.2d 821, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 66 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the language of the act by which the court of appeals was created, the supreme court does not secure jurisdiction of a direct appeal from the lower court by reason of the fact that nothing but a question of law is presented on the appeal, and its jurisdiction in such cases depends upon the method of trial in the lower court. Poston v. Aetna Ins. Co., 183 Tenn. 137, 191 S.W.2d 180, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (1945).

       The power to grant writs of certiorari and supersedeas to review the actions of lower courts depends upon the same rules governing appeals to the one court or the other. Cox v.

       Court of appeals is without power to order a supersedeas to issue except upon a finding that there is error in the judgments of which the petitioner complains. Sullivan v. Eason, 5 Tenn. App. 137, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 45 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).

       Supreme court held without jurisdiction to grant writs of certiorari and supersedeas to supersede action of circuit court in discharging supersedeas previously granted. State v. Chattanooga, 153 Tenn. 349, 284 S.W. 359, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 31 (1926).

       Where the pleadings disclose issue or issues of fact that are to be determined by proof in the lower court, such reviewing power is with the court of appeals. Cox v. Smith, 154 Tenn. 369, 289 S.W. 524, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a demurrer is overruled and answer is filed and excepted to, which exceptions are also overruled, application for a petition for certiorari and supersedeas is to be made to the court of appeals, since, whenever the collateral issues presented by such petition are disposed of, the cause will stand for trial in the lower court upon proof as to facts.

      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court is without jurisdiction to grant writs of certiorari and supersedeas in a case pending in the trial court, which has not been there finally determined, and in which the pleadings present issue of fact to be determined upon proof to be heard by that court. Cox v. Smith, 154 Tenn. 369, 289 S.W. 524, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1926).

       Where a justice of the supreme court erroneously grants writs of certiorari and supersedeas that should have been presented to a judge of the court of appeals, the supreme court must discharge the writs, and cannot transfer the case to the court of appeals.

       Since judges of intermediate appellate courts are not assigned to any district or circuit, voting by district or circuit is not required, and this is in no way changed by the requirement that no more than four of the 12 judges on each intermediate appellate court may reside in any one of three grand divisions of Tennessee; a district is a political subdivision, and while a district usually connotes a subunit of a county and may be subject to reconfiguration, a grand division refers to one of three permanently defined, large umbrella units, each composed of many counties and districts, and a grand division is not a district within the meaning of the Constitution. Hooker v. Haslam, 437 S.W.3d 409, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes creating the intermediate courts of appeal distinguish between a residency requirement for a candidate for office and residence of voters for purposes of voting in exactly the same way as does the Constitution in establishing the Supreme Court; in both instances, a judicial candidate can be required to live in a certain geographic area as a qualification for office, but still be elected statewide without regard to geographic area in which the qualified voters reside. Hooker v. Haslam, 437 S.W.3d 409, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a grand division were deemed to be a district, the statutory limitation on residence by grand division would still be irrelevant, since the judges of the intermediate appellate courts are not assigned to any grand division; the statutory residence requirement by grand division is merely a limiting qualification for the office of intermediate appellate judge, and it is not a limitation on voting. Hooker v. Haslam, 437 S.W.3d 409, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014).

        Where jurisdiction is not conferred on some other court, the circuit court has original jurisdiction. Staples v. Brown, 113 Tenn. 639, 85 S.W. 254, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1904); Johnson v. White, 171 Tenn. 536, 106 S.W.2d 222, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1937).

        The circuit court takes jurisdiction to try a contest over the election of mayor of a city, under the provision of this section. Baker v. Mitchell, 105 Tenn. 610, 59 S.W. 137, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1900); Adcock v. Houk, 122 Tenn. 269, 122 S.W. 979, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1909); Taylor v. Carr, 125 Tenn. 235, 141 S.W. 745, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision of this section does not deprive the chancery court of its jurisdiction to restrain the exercise of unconstitutional powers, and chancery may restrain the removal of a county seat, for want of the requisite vote, for such suit is not a contested election case. Lindsay v. Allen, 112 Tenn. 637, 82 S.W. 171, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contest of an election to determine whether a county should take stock in a railroad was not an election contest falling within the jurisdiction of the circuit court under the provisions of this section but was an action which regularly should have been brought in chancery court. Catlett v. Knoxville, S. & E. R. Co., 120 Tenn. 699, 112 S.W. 559, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cases involving annexation of corporate territory, county subscriptions to railroad companies and removal of county seats are not in the classification of contested elections so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the circuit court but are under the class of cases where the chancery court restrains officers from the exercise of unconstitutional power. Adcock v. Houk, 122 Tenn. 269, 122 S.W. 979, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1909).

       <p>
        This statute is broad and comprehensive and affords a remedy in an election contest where it is not conferred upon any other tribunal. Johnson v. White, 171 Tenn. 536, 106 S.W.2d 222, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1937).

       <p>
        A city council is not a “judicial tribunal,” within the meaning of this section, and the circuit court is not deprived of its original jurisdiction by giving a city council only cumulative jurisdiction of contested election.

        A possible transfer to criminal court is not sufficient grounds for negating the statutory general authority of the circuit court in favor of the specific, limited authority of the criminal court which does not arise until transfer.

        Jurisdiction to try an issue of devisavit vel non is exclusively in the circuit court, and the chancery court has no jurisdiction to try such issue. Section 16-11-102 does not confer this jurisdiction on the chancery court. The chancery court cannot even try the issue as an incident in a suit involving other matter of proper equitable congizance, but should direct the parties to take appropriate steps to secure such a trial in the circuit court. Simmons v. Leonard, 89 Tenn. 622, 15 S.W. 444, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1891); Simmons v. Leonard, 91 Tenn. 183, 18 S.W. 280, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 92, 30 Am. St. Rep. 875 (1892).
       </p>

        The jurisdiction of the circuit court is exclusive in the matter of the contest of wills; therefore a chancery court cannot entertain and try an issue of devisavit vel non although it is presented in connection with matters of equitable cognizance.

        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a father's petition for change of custody because the statute was not applicable; the allegations in the petition were not tantamount to allegations of dependency and neglect under the statute but were more in the nature of a disagreement over the long-term manner of addressing the children's psychological, behavioral, and educational issues.

        Where the jurisdiction is not demurred to, the plaintiff's suit of equitable cognizance will not be dismissed, but the circuit judge may, at his discretion, transfer the cause to the chancery court, or retain and determine it himself upon the principles of equity and according to the practice of the chancery court.

        The jurisdiction to abate a public nuisance is in chancery, circuit, and criminal courts.

        Under this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c10s16-10-101" target="_self">16-10-101</a></cite>, one adjudged by the juvenile court of a county to be a delinquent child may obtain a review of his case by certiorari in the circuit court of that county.

       </p>
       <p>
        The means of procuring a review by the circuit court of a judgment of the juvenile court is by the statutory writ of certiorari and on review in the circuit court the parties are entitled to a trial by a jury, if desired, and may introduce competent evidence. Doster v. State, 195 Tenn. 535, 260 S.W.2d 279, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 375 (1953).

        Under this section, the circuit court has appellate jurisdiction of decisions of the juvenile courts. State v. Womack, 591 S.W.2d 437, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 344 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).

        By virtue of this section and §§ 40-408 (repealed) and 40-426 (repealed), the criminal courts of the county have authority to grant extraordinary relief in appeals from courts of inferior jurisdiction. Franks v. State, 565 S.W.2d 36, 1977 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 271 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1977).

        A possible transfer to criminal court is not sufficient grounds for negating the statutory general authority of the circuit court in favor of the specific, limited authority of the criminal court which does not arise until transfer.

        It is the duty of the circuit judge to attend and hold court at the time appointed by law; but if for any reason the circuit judge fails to appear, the clerk of the court may open and adjourn the court from time to time to some future day or days, or, if the clerk thinks the rights and interests of litigants or the business of the court require it, may so open and adjourn the court to some future day or days subsequent to the time allowed by law in which to hold such court. If no judge attends by four o'clock p.m. (4:00 p.m.) on the day to which the clerk last adjourned the court, then the court shall be adjourned by the clerk to the court in course.

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         There is no discontinuance because of the void disposition of the case by a special judge appointed under an unconstitutional statute, nor by failure to enter a formal continuance in the particular cause. Johnston v. Ditty, 15 Tenn. 84, 15 Tenn. 85, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1834); Sims v. State, 72 Tenn. 357, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1880).
        </p>
        <p>
         A discontinuance is the result of some act done or omitted by the plaintiff, which legally withdraws his cause from the power and jurisdiction of the court, and cannot be worked by an order of the court over which the plaintiff has no control, as where the court, of its own motion, made an order transmitting the papers to another court for trial, where such order is simply void.

         An agreement made out of court to arbitrate matters involved in a pending suit operates as a discontinuance of the suit. Eddings v. Gillespie, 59 Tenn. 548, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1873).

         This section evidently implies that the judge may attend and commence the term, by presiding in court at any of the times to which the court has been adjourned by the clerk under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c10s16-10-201" target="_self">16-10-201</a></cite> and before the clerk is compelled to adjourn the term to court in course.

        The inherent jurisdiction of our chancery court is the jurisdiction of the high court of chancery of England, which was adopted by North Carolina as the jurisdiction of the chancery court of that state, and which was adopted in this state, upon its formation and organization, by its adoption of the laws of North Carolina, and in the creation of its chancery court; and the jurisdiction subsequently vested in such court by the legislature is called its statutory jurisdiction. J. W. Kelly & Co. v. Conner, 122 Tenn. 339, 123 S.W. 622, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 26, 25 L.R.A. (n.s.) 201 (1909).

        The vesting of jurisdiction in the county court by statute does not deprive the chancery court of its inherent jurisdiction of administration of estates. Dick v.

        Chancery court has jurisdiction to enjoin the collection of collateral notes until proper credit has been entered upon the notes they secure; and, such jurisdiction not turning upon amount involved, limitation of jurisdiction of chancery to sums exceeding $50.00 does not apply.

        In an action in which a husband's children from a prior marriage contended that a wife's last will was invalid because it breached a contract in which the wife and the husband agreed to make mutual wills, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c16s16-16-201ol1a" target="_self">16-16-201(a)</a></cite> provided the court with subject matter jurisdiction to probate wills, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.32.html#t32c04s32-4-109" target="_blank">32-4-109</a></cite> provided the court with jurisdiction to hear will contests, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c14s29-14-102" target="_blank">29-14-102</a></cite> provided the court with jurisdiction to hear declaratory judgment actions, and T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c11s16-11-101" target="_self">16-11-101</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c11s16-11-102ol1a" target="_self">16-11-102(a)</a></cite> provided the court with jurisdiction to hear actions for breach of oral or written contracts.

       <p>
        Chancery court erred in exercising subject matter jurisdiction over a bail bond company's action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment declaring proposed Local Rules of Practice and Procedure for Bail Bond Companies unenforceable, unconstitutional, and in violation of the law because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain an action for declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the validity of local rules of the criminal court. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn. Mar. 22, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a bail bond company's underlying claim for injunctive relief regarding Local Rules of Practice and Procedure for Bail Bond Companies could not be brought in chancery court, the chancery court could not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment aspect of the case either; the courts should not assume that subject matter jurisdiction existed based on the fact that the issue was not addressed. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn. Mar. 22, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        To allow the chancery court to review the validity or enjoin the enforcement of the local rules of the criminal court would interfere with the inherent power of the criminal court to administer its affairs and impose reasonable regulations regarding the making of bonds; the statutes and rules do not authorize chancery court review of the local rules of the criminal court. Memphis Bonding Co. v. Crim. Court of Tenn. 30th Dist., 490 S.W.3d 458, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 930 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (Tenn.

        Where a replevin action between plaintiff and defendant to determine the right to possession of an automobile given to each by a deceased person was instituted in the general sessions court and appealed to the circuit court whereon creditors of the deceased attempted to intervene to have the conveyances to plaintiff and defendant declared fraudulent and the auto declared part of the estate, this intervention could not be sustained since creditors were not judgment creditors nor had they proceeded by attachment. Therefore, the creditors were without interest in the replevin action; also the bill to have the conveyance declared fraudulent was bad since the circuit court had appellate jurisdiction only and could not grant the relief asked. Creditors remedy was in equity. Marlin v. Merrill, 25 Tenn. App. 328, 156 S.W.2d 814, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).

        When developers sued a bank in circuit court, which then sued the developers in chancery court, the cases were consolidated, the developers did not appeal the dismissal of the developers'  chancery court counterclaim, and the circuit court case was dismissed, res judicata barred further litigation because (1) a dismissal of the developers'  chancery court counterclaim was an adjudication on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, due to the chancery court's concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit court, and (2) the suits involved the same parties and events.

        A court of equity has never had jurisdiction to assess unliquidated damages and the Act of 1887 which enlarged the jurisdiction of equity courts specifically exclude cases of unliquidated damages for injury to person or character and for injuries to property not resulting from a breach of contract. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Co. v. Fain, 109 Tenn. 56, 70 S.W. 813, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1902).

       </p>
       <p>
        Suit for personal injuries which also sought to have release alleged to have been fraudulently procured set aside was improperly brought in chancery as the main purpose of the suit was for unliquidated damages and the equitable right to have the release set aside was merely incidental and could be disposed of in a court of law.

        Chancery court was able to fully adjudicate a matter because, to the extent that the damages sought were unliquidated damages above the exact amount of damages sought for an alleged misappropriation, the court, having taken jurisdiction over the liquidated portion of the damages, was able to fully adjudicate the matter.

       <p>
        Decedent's real property, which vested in the heirs immediately upon her death, was not part of her estate subject to be sold for payment of her obligations in the absence of proof that her personal property was insufficient to discharge those obligations. The property, therefore, was not affected by statutory provisions relating to the administration of decedents' estates.

        While this statute does not confer on the chancery court jurisdiction of unliquidated damages growing out of injury or trespass to property, person, or character (except for damages for injuries to property resulting from a breach of contract), where the court has jurisdiction by injunction, or upon some recognized ground of equity, it may give damages as an incident to such jurisdiction.

       </p>
       <p>
        The statute expressly excepts from the jurisdiction of chancery the cases of injury to property involving unliquidated damages; and chancery can only take jurisdiction of such matter as an incident to equitable relief granted, and not where all equitable relief is refused.

        The restriction and limitation of jurisdiction of chancery to sums exceeding $50.00 applies only when the jurisdiction turns wholly upon the amount involved. If the jurisdiction to grant the relief sought is exclusively conferred upon the chancery court, the limitation as to amount does not apply, there being no other remedy. Malone v. Dean, 77 Tenn. 336, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1882); Washburn v. Moore, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 268 (1912).

        Where old board reelected defendant as recorder and new board elected petitioner the chancery court could not enjoin defendant from interfering with petitioner in exercising duties connected with his office pending determination of right to office. State ex rel. Brumit v. Grindstaff, 144 Tenn. 554, 234 S.W. 510, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1921).

        Plaintiff elected as superintendent was entitled to issuance of an injunction by chancery court against interference in duties of office from defendant where issue of election contest was not involved. Hart v. Pierce, 169 Tenn. 411, 88 S.W.2d 798, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        The $50.00 requirement for jurisdiction refers only to those cases in which chancery has exclusive original jurisdiction and does not apply to those cases where chancery has exclusive ancillary jurisdiction in enforcement of demand. Covert v. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry., 186 Tenn. 142, 208 S.W.2d 1008, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 529, 1 A.L.R.2d 154 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The chancery court is limited by the amount of $50.00 only in those cases of an equitable nature where the chancery court has an exclusive original jurisdiction under this section, but is not limited to such amount in other cases of auxiliary or ancillary jurisdiction conferred by other statutes without regard to amount. Tritschler v. Cartwright, 46 Tenn. App. 662, 333 S.W.2d 6, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).

        The amount sued for in chancery determines the jurisdiction, and not the amount found to be due on the hearing. Spurlock v. Fulks, 31 Tenn. 289, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1851); Brimingham v. Tapscott, 51 Tenn. 382, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 178 (1871); Wagstaff v. Braden, 60 Tenn. 304, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 495 (1872); Malone v. Dean, 77 Tenn. 336, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1882).

       <p>
        In an action to recover for the breach of covenants in a deed, where the sum involved was less than $50.00 and it was insisted that an equity court could not take jurisdiction, held, that if the suit had been only for $50.00 the court could not take jurisdiction but since the bill also sought other relief for which complainant had no remedy at law, the equity court had jurisdiction.

        Exclusive jurisdiction of chancery court in enforcing judgments against property subject to execution did not deprive circuit court of exclusive jurisdiction of proceeding by wife to enforce award of alimony and child support provisions of decree entered by circuit court in divorce proceeding, since § 36-822 (now § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c05s36-5-103" target="_blank">36-5-103</a></cite>) provides that court which grants divorce decree may employ for the enforcement of the decree “such other lawful means as are usual and according to the course and practice of the court,” as divorce suit is to all intents and purposes a chancery proceeding.

        This statute is inapplicable to a suit to enjoin a defendant from cutting timber and to recover for the value of the timber already cut and removed, involving an issue as to the title to a strip of land between adjoining owners, depending on the location of the boundary line. Union Tanning Co. v. Lowe, 148 Tenn. 407, 255 S.W. 712, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1923).

        Purpose of a suit to establish or locate boundary lines of contiguous or adjoining tracts of land can be determined only from the pleadings. Union Tanning Co. v. Lowe, 148 Tenn. 407, 255 S.W. 712, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a boundary line dispute was the gravamen of the complaint, an action was a boundary line dispute, not an ejectment action, since, even though defendant's answer alleged title to part of the land by adverse possession, it did not contain a counterclaim. Burks v. Boles, 934 S.W.2d 653, 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 371 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).

        It was proper for circuit court judge, acting sua sponte, to order that case be bifurcated, and that there be a trial in the chancery court as to boundary line dispute while retaining tort claims in the circuit court. Burnette v. Pickel, 858 S.W.2d 319, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993), appeal denied, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 265 (Tenn. July 6, 1993).

        Where suit was to determine boundaries, and was not in the nature of ejectment, plaintiff could establish his boundary upon the deeds of all parties to the action, and was not limited to recovery upon the strength of his own title alone. Cusick v. Cutshaw, 34 Tenn. App. 283, 237 S.W.2d 563, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary for complainants to prove ownership of land in question at time of filing suit where it was shown that they formerly owned the land and had conveyed by a warranty deed and that it was for the protection against liability under such warranty that they brought suit. Patterson v. T. J. Moss Tie Co., 46 Tenn. App. 405, 330 S.W.2d 344, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a boundary dispute complainant must prove that he is the true owner or that he has become entitled to possession of the disputed area of land by clear proof. Carr v. Wilbanks, 45 Tenn. App. 372, 324 S.W.2d 786, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 131 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere fact that defendant specifically asserted in his answer that the cause could be maintained as a suit in ejectment only but filed no cross bill could not deprive the complainants of the right expressly granted by statute to prove their case without a complete deraignment of title. Patterson v. T. J. Moss Tie Co., 46 Tenn. App. 405, 330 S.W.2d 344, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complainants are entitled to establish a boundary line by reference to title papers of other parties as well as their own. Patterson v. T. J. Moss Tie Co., 46 Tenn. App. 405, 330 S.W.2d 344, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a deed contains an adequate particular description of the property conveyed, it will not be controlled by a recital therein of the quantity or number of acres unless it clearly appears that it was the intention to convey only a definite quantity. Williams v. Daniel, 545 S.W.2d 120, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 258 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a sale of property is in gross and not by the acre and there is opportunity to examine the land and where there is no showing of fraud, the deed will stand as written, despite a mutual mistake as to the number of acres contained in the tract conveyed. Williams v. Daniel, 545 S.W.2d 120, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 258 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A suit concerning a boundary line dispute was not a suit for ejectment and it was not necessary that plaintiff prove a complete deraignment of title from a state grant or a common source but was only required to prove clearly that he was the true owner of the land described in the complaint. Arrowood v. Williams, 586 S.W.2d 131, 1979 Tenn. App. LEXIS 331 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prove clearly that the parties in a boundary dispute are the true owners, simply means that the complainant must prove that he is the true owner or that he had become entitled to the possession of land adjacent to the boundary which he undertakes to have established. Thornburg v. Chase, 606 S.W.2d 672, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 384 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining disputed boundaries, resort is to be had first to natural objects or landmarks, because of their very permanent character; next, to artificial monument or marks, then to the boundary lines of adjacent landowners, and then to courses and distances. This rule of construction is to aid in determining the intention of the parties to a deed which is to be determined, if possible, from the instrument in connection with the surrounding circumstances. Thornburg v. Chase, 606 S.W.2d 672, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 384 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason why a monument or adjacent line is ordinarily given preference over courses and distances is that the parties so presumed to have examined the property have, in viewing the premises, taken note of the monument or line. Thornburg v. Chase, 606 S.W.2d 672, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 384 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a plat showed a straight boundary line between two agreed points but an old fence line along the boundary had a slight bow in it, the artificial markers in the old fence line controlled over the straight line protracted on the subdivision plat, particularly where the evidence in the record establishes the bow in the old fence line could not be detected on a visual inspection of the premises and could only be ascertained through sophisticated surveying equipment which, was not available to surveyor at the time of preparation of the plat. Thornburg v. Chase, 606 S.W.2d 672, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 384 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The complainant is not required to prove a complete deraignment of title from the state nor to prove a common source of title but is required to prove clearly that he is the true owner of the property described in the complaint. Franks v. Burks, 688 S.W.2d 435, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3365 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

        The burden of the plaintiff in a boundary line dispute is somewhat less than that borne by the plaintiff in an ejectment action, but, he must, nevertheless, establish title in the complainant and he must prove clearly that he is the true owner of the lands described in his bill. Nelson v. Walls Properties, Inc., 611 S.W.2d 409, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) simply means that the complainant must prove that he is the true owner or that he had become entitled to the possession of land adjacent to the boundary which he undertakes to have established, that is, the disputed area of land, by clear proof, and the chancellor would be confined to a determination by the clear proof, if he rested his decision upon title, to decree title only to the particular disputed area. Blankenship v. Blankenship, 658 S.W.2d 125, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 611 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).

        Where suit was actually one in ejectment although defendant led trial court into believing that it was a boundary line dispute and trial court erroneously treated cause as boundary line dispute, cause would be remanded to be proceeded to a conclusion as an ejectment suit and to afford complainant an opportunity to deraign title from a common source or grant from the state. Carr v. Wilbanks, 45 Tenn. App. 372, 324 S.W.2d 786, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 131 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).

        Decree dismissing suit to enjoin defendants from cutting timber on land in which the defendant denied complainant's title to the land, on the ground that complainant did not deraign title, should not preclude complainant from suing in ejectment for the land, and the bill should be dismissed without prejudice.

        Where a boundary dispute begun under this section developed into an ejectment action and the defendant failed to establish an actual, open, notorious, exclusive and hostile possession for the required statutory time, he could not get title by adverse possession.

        The exhaustion of the legal remedy against a judgment debtor in another state is shown by the fact that the property of such debtor in the state of his residence has been placed at the suit of creditors, in the possession of a receiver under a statute forbidding interference with it. Commercial Nat'l Bank v. Matherwell Iron &amp; Steel Co., 95 Tenn. 172, 31 S.W. 1002, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 75, <cite class="lra">29 L.R.A. 164</cite> (1895).

        In action to enforce foreign judgment against nonresident by bill against property in this state, and averment that complainant had attempted to collect his claim, and had not succeeded, was not a sufficient showing that complainant had exhausted his legal remedies so as to warrant attachment under the statute.

        The supreme court has repeatedly applied this section in cases where suits were brought in chancery by nonresidents, who had exhausted their remedy in the foreign state, to subject specific property in this state, of a nonresident debtor, recognizing that this was the purpose of the statute. The statute confers on the chancery court jurisdiction to give relief under these conditions “and under no other.” Phillips v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 183 Tenn. 266, 191 S.W.2d 554, 1946 Tenn.

        In a conservatorship proceeding where the brother-in-law sought to be appointed conservator over the elderly widow, the record contained clear and convincing evidence that the brother-in-law was a party, along with the deceased, to a conveyance to the brother-in-law undertaken for the sole purpose of enabling the deceased and the widow to qualify for governmental assistance under TennCare to which they would not otherwise have been entitled; therefore, because of the fraudulent character of the conveyance and the brother-in-laws' role in it, the brother-in-law was not entitled to gain personally from the transfer of funds by being permitted to retain the money, and the trial court did not err by setting aside the transaction and ordering the brother-in-law to return the unspent remainder of the certificate of deposit.

       <p>
        A court of equity has no jurisdiction to compel a decedent's heirs to convey his lands in another state to a special commissioner for the sale thereof in order to pay decedent's debts, although the estate be insolvent. Creditors must seek relief in the courts of the state where such lands are located. Robinson v. Johnson, 52 S.W. 704, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 28 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee chancery court did not have jurisdiction to divest the title out of the third party and vest it in another since the real estate was located in another state and the court has no power to act upon foreign land.

        Chancery has jurisdiction to allot dower, and, as incident thereto, to compel the production of title papers, and the discovery of any matters necessary to a proper ascertainment of the condition of the landed estate of the deceased husband in the possession of the heirs. Clift v. Clift, 87 Tenn. 17, 9 S.W. 198, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary duty of determining whether dower may be set aside and, if so, fixing the boundaries thereof, rests with the commissioners and secondarily, with the court in event exceptions are filed by any interested party. Wyrick v. Hale, 30 Tenn. App. 597, 209 S.W.2d 50, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court should not attempt to determine questions relating to the allotment of homestead and dower until commissioners have been appointed and have reported their findings. Wyrick v. Hale, 30 Tenn. App. 597, 209 S.W.2d 50, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).

        Statutes giving chancery court jurisdiction concurrent with county court do not in express terms include jurisdiction to set aside homestead, but same may be said for section defining jurisdiction of county courts however, both courts have jurisdiction from ancient times and practice has been both in county and chancery court to appoint commissioners to set aside homestead.

        The chancery court of a county in which a partnership was formed and conducted has jurisdiction, under this statute, of a suit by resident partner against the other partner who is a nonresident, for a partnership settlement, or to ascertain a debt growing out of the partnership transactions; and to issue to other counties attachments, injunctions, or other necessary process.

          It is the intent of this section to create a general sessions court in every county not expressly excepted in this section. In any county where a general sessions court has been created pursuant to the general provisions of this chapter, it is intended that the county shall always have a general sessions court unless abolished by another general statute. In counties in which there is no court of general sessions as provided in this section, references in this code to the court of general sessions are deemed to include the court having the jurisdiction of the court of general sessions in such counties.

           In a termination of parental rights proceeding, a local attorney was permitted to hear the case as a special judge.

             A justice of the peace (now general sessions court judges) cannot issue an alias or pluries execution until the execution previously issued is returned, or affidavit filed accounting for its absence, and showing that it is unsatisfied.

             Where on the day execution was issued the officer summoned the garnishee, without attempting to find personal property of the debtor but would have found no personal property if he had looked, made sufficient response on the back of the execution but did not return it to the justice (now general sessions court) and then again summoned the garnishee by use of the same execution within the 30-day limit and again made response and this time returned it to the justice the second garnishment was valid.

             The purpose of Acts 1899, ch. 39, providing that whenever any execution, issued by a justice of the peace (now general sessions court), is levied on real estate, the title to the real estate shall not be affected as to third parties, unless the execution or the papers in the case are filed in the circuit court within 10 days after the levy, is to give third parties notice of the lien of the execution, and is for the protection of third parties.

             An execution issued by a justice of the peace (now general sessions court) was not rendered invalid by the fact that at the date of its issuance the original summons was lost, and no steps had then been taken to supply it; Shannon's Code, § 4800 (§ 19-604) (now § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-803" target="_self">16-15-803</a></cite>), providing that when the docket book and the original papers are destroyed, the justice of the peace may supply them, and issue execution as though they had not been destroyed, not being applicable, since it outlines the practice where all the papers and docket books are lost, and not where the summons alone is lost. Baker Watkins Supply Co. v. Fowlkes, 129 Tenn. 663, 168 S.W. 153, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1914).

             Contention that suing out of warrants before justice of peace (now general sessions court) could not be considered commencement of an action had no merit in view of fact that words “warrant” and “summons,” as applicable to proceedings before justices of peace, are used interchangeably both in decisions and statutes. Galbraith v. Kirby, 21 Tenn. App. 303, 109 S.W.2d 1168, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 35 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).

             A warrant unsigned by a justice of the peace (now general sessions judge) is a nullity, and all proceedings under it are void, unless the objection be in some manner waived by the party. It is the duty of the justice issuing a warrant not only to sign it himself, but to endorse on the back of it the date of its issuance, which becomes an important matter under the plea of the statute of limitations. Smith v. Kirkwood, 3 Shan. 650 (1875).

             Oral evidence is admissible to prove that a justice's (now general sessions judge's) warrant was forged or fraudulent, as well as to show that it is genuine. On a plea of the statute of limitations, the defendant is entitled to prove, by oral evidence, when the suit was, in fact, commenced, especially when the date of the issuance of the warrant is not given. Smith v. Kirkwood, 3 Shan. 650 (1875). See Osborne v. State, 17 Tenn. 488, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1836).

             Where suit against nonresident was by original attachment in circuit court for damages for tort committed by defendant, court properly sustained defendant's motion to quash the attachment and dismiss the suit, because the affidavit in support of the writ of attachment was verified by oath attested by notary public instead of by the clerk who issued the writ. Notary public has same power as justices (now general sessions court judges) to administer oaths; and justices have no such power where that power is “expressly entrusted to some other officer.” Campbell v.

              Although under Tennessee statutory law, a justice of the peace (now judge of the court of general sessions) has the power to issue criminal warrants returnable to the general sessions court, as a matter of state and federal constitutional law, he does not have such power, since under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c21s8-21-401ol1a1c" target="_blank">8-21-401(a)(1)(c)</a></cite> (repealed) a justice of the peace receives a fee “for issuing a state's warrant with affidavit” and therefore cannot be neutral and detached in issuing such warrant in violation of U.S. Const., amend. 14 and Tenn. Const., art. I, § 8. In re Dender, 571 S.W.2d 491, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 647 (Tenn. 1978).

              Following the expiration of the automatic stay of the chancery court's April 16, 2017 judgment, appellant failed to obtain a stay pending appeal and thus the judgment became enforceable on May 15, 2017 and remained enforceable when appellee sought to enforce the judgment by filing a detainer summons in the general sessions court and when appellant appealed to the circuit court. The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate this detainer action. Bottorff v. Sears, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 259 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 23, 2019).

              If the judgment rendered upon the indorsement exceeds the amount of the jurisdiction, but there is nothing in the warrant or judgment to show in what character the liability of the indorser arose, the defendant can only avail himself of the want of jurisdiction by appeal or by certiorari and supersedeas in lieu of an appeal; but not by a collateral proceeding, as by certiorari in lieu of audita querela, sued out to quash the judgment and execution. So, where the proceedings in any case do not show what was the character of the defendant's liability, the judgment is not open to a collateral attack. Witt v. Russey, 29 Tenn. 208, 1849 Tenn.

              A justice's (now general sessions court judge's) judgment for a sum exceeding his jurisdiction, shown by the papers or the judgment, is void, though the excess may be for accumulated interest, and jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent; but the circuit court may render judgment for interest on a justice's judgment not exceeding his jurisdiction. If it does not appear from the papers or judgment that the judgment exceeded the justice's jurisdiction, the judgment is not void, but only voidable. Wallen v. Lane, 1 Tenn. 74, 1804 Tenn.

                If it is determined on appeal that the jury's verdict is within the range of reasonableness or that both the jury's and the trial judge's awards are within that range, the appellate court must restore the jury verdict; if only the trial judge's award is within the range, it must be affirmed; if neither are within the range of reasonableness, the court of appeals should make appropriate use of remittitur or additur and render judgment within the range of reasonableness based upon the credible proof of damages.

                Case law stands for the proposition that the 10-day requirement in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-727ol1b" target="_self">16-15-727(b)</a></cite> is inapplicable when the basis upon which relief is sought is that service of process was never achieved, thereby rendering the judgment void ab initio; in this case, the general sessions court did have jurisdiction to rule on defendants'  motion to void the default judgments.

                It would work a substantial injustice to appellee to deny him relief from a judgment entered in 2011 in an action which had been initiated with a civil warrant filed in 2007 but not executed on until 2018; therefore, the statute did not prevent the general sessions court from exercising its authority to determine the validity of the judgment and to grant appellee relief.

                Where a justice of the peace (now general sessions judge) entered judgment against one defendant, and made no entry as to another, he cannot while the cause is on trial in the circuit court, be called in, and, upon his memory alone, be allowed to enter a judgment by way of amendment as to the other defendant, against whom he had made no entry, or to prove the facts by parol. The presumption is that the suit was dismissed as to the defendant against whom no entry was made. Trevathan v. Caldwell, 51 Tenn. 535, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 201 (1871).

                In a case appealed from the general sessions court to the circuit court and subjected to de novo review, the rule limiting plaintiff's recovery to the jurisdictional limits of the general sessions court is not viable in the light of the adoption of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure and the principles of judicial economy; abrogating Moran v. Weinberger, 149 Tenn. 537, 260 S.W. 966, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1924). Ware v. Meharry Medical College, 898 S.W.2d 181, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 189 (Tenn. 1995).

                Cases appealed from the general sessions court to the circuit court pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-729" target="_self">16-15-729</a></cite> should be treated for all purposes as if they originated in the circuit court. The parties should be permitted to file amended pleadings to the fullest extent permitted by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15 without regard to the general sessions court's monetary limits as doing so will promote judicial economy by enabling the parties to resolve their disputes on the merits in a single proceeding. B &amp; G Constr. v. Polk, 37 S.W.3d 462, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 249 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000), rehearing denied, B &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Polk, — S.W.3d —, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. Ct.

                Where defendants' appeal to the circuit court opened the door for the plaintiff to amend its complaint to include relief not available in the general session proceeding, the circuit court acted properly in awarding plaintiff in landlord and tenant dispute not only possession, but also damages and discretionary costs. B & G Constr. v. Polk, 37 S.W.3d 462, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 249 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000), rehearing denied, B & G Constr., Inc. v. Polk, — S.W.3d —, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. Ct.

                While plaintiff tenant had waived remand for failure to file a motion to remand timely as required by <cite class="us_code">28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)</cite>, and he had asserted federal arguments including violation of his due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and violations of the Fair Housing Act, <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 794</cite>, there was a question whether defendant housing authority, under <cite class="us_code">28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)</cite>, could remove a state court eviction action based on federal question jurisdiction under <cite class="us_code">28 U.S.C. § 1331</cite> merely by labeling the tenant's petition/appeal in that action as a “complaint” (which was itself an appeal for a trial de novo pursuant to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c18s29-18-128" target="_blank">29-18-128</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-729" target="_self">16-15-729</a></cite>, of a final judgment in the housing authority's state court unlawful detainer action) and the tenant as a “plaintiff,” thus, briefing was required as to whether subject matter existed.

                Circuit court properly dismissed defendant's appeal and affirmed the judgment of the general sessions court pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c05s27-5-107" target="_blank">27-5-107</a></cite> because to preserve plaintiff's original cause of action after dismissal, plaintiff had to perfect an appeal to the circuit court as prescribed by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c05s27-5-108" target="_blank">27-5-108</a></cite>, but plaintiff did not appeal the judgment, and his cause of action proceeded to the circuit court only by virtue of defendant's appeal; while defendant's appeal was pending, plaintiff was free to amend his complaint pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-729" target="_self">16-15-729</a></cite>, however, defendant could dismiss the appeal without the consent and over the objection of plaintiff, and the dismissal of defendant's appeal removed the case from the circuit court and was fatal to plaintiff's amended cause of action.

                Court of appeals did not err in affirming an order dismissing an insured's underinsured motorist claim against an insurer because the insured failed to amend to increase the amount of damages beyond those specified in the warrant she filed in general sessions court after she perfected a de novo appeal to the circuit court, and the amount of the insured's damages was limited to the amount she requested in her general sessions warrant; the amount of damages a party appealing to circuit court from general sessions court seeks to recover is limited to the amount sought in the warrant filed in general sessions court until an amendment to increase the amount of damages is filed in the circuit court.

                It is not necessary that a warrant set out a cause of action with the particularity and precision required in a declaration in a court of law and it is sufficient if there is a general statement indicating the grounds of action so that defendant will not be misled in preparing his defense, the warrant being simply a summons rather than standing in lieu of a declaration with the pleadings being ore tenus.

                The circuit court has not only the power, but it is its duty to permit a motion for money collected by an officer on an execution and not paid over, originally made before a justice of the peace, to be amended so as to make the suit one for insufficient return, as well as for the delinquency in failing to pay over the money collected.

                There is no liability of a surety on the bond of a sheriff where that officer took and held possession of a stolen automobile under instructions of nonresident police chief, since such possession was not under “color of office,” where the car was destroyed while being driven by the sheriff on private business. The common law rule that a sheriff holds stolen property for the sovereign is not in force in Tennessee. State use of Rosser v. Freeman, 166 Tenn. 296, 61 S.W.2d 459, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1933).

                 The purpose of subsection (b) is to prevent secret liens under justices' (now general sessions judges') judgments, by requiring the executions levied on land to be filed and docketed in the circuit court of the county where the land lies. Thompson v. Blanks, 114 Tenn. 54, 84 S.W. 804, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1905).

                <p>
                 The order of condemnation is not a judgment in the strict sense of the word, but only a mode of executing the levy. The order gives no lien, but merely continues the lien of the levy, to which the title of the purchaser under the sale will relate. Overton v. Perkins, 8 Tenn. 367, 1828 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1828); Ashworth v. Demier & Boyles, 60 Tenn. 323, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (1872); Mann v. Roberts, 79 Tenn. 57, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 13 (1883); Crabtree v.

                </p>
                <p>
                 Condemnation under the levy of a justice's (now general session judge's) execution upon land follows as matter of course where the judgment is not void on its face, and the proceedings are in other respects regular. Cowan, McClung & Co. v. Lowry, 75 Tenn. 620, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 158 (1881); Crabtree v. Bank of Winchester, 108 Tenn. 483, 67 S.W. 797, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1902).
                </p>
                <p>
                 The necessary implication is that the legislative scheme for the condemnation of land levied on under an execution issuing from a justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment contemplates that the filing of the papers in the cause in the circuit court carries with it the judgment as well, and thus the justice would be stripped of every vestige of control over the cause. The circuit court acquires, and the justice's court (now general sessions court) loses, all jurisdiction over the case upon delivery of the papers and docketing of the case in the circuit court. Crabtree v. Bank of Winchester, 108 Tenn. 483, 67 S.W. 797, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1902).

                 While the record of the condemnation in the circuit court after levy of execution from a justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment is, as a general proposition, constructive notice of the sheriff's sale, the order of condemnation is not a judgment, nor does it fix a lien, but is only a mode of executing the levy, and merely continues the lien fixed by the levy. Hammock v. Qualls, 139 Tenn. 388, 201 S.W. 517, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1918).

                 Judgment on warrant citing defendant to appear “immediately” is not void, because the law fixes no time in which the defendant shall be required to appear, and the defendant could get to the office of the justice (now general sessions judge) as soon as the officers could do so to return the papers. Elliott & Co. v. Jordan, 66 Tenn. 376, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 147 (1874).

                 Parties interested under an execution may agree to a sale without advertisement, and the sale will be valid and pass the title. Such sale will not discharge a stayor of another execution subsequently levied on the property subject to such prior levy. Amis v. Dreer, 3 Shan. 698 (1875).
                </p>
                <p>
                 If the officer is guilty of collusion in selling without advertisement under a waiver thereof, or makes himself liable for an insufficient return on the last execution, the execution creditor is not bound to pursue his remedies against the officer for the benefit of the stayor, and the stayor is not thereby discharged.

                 The circuit court of the county in which an execution is issued upon a certified execution from another county has jurisdiction of a petition for certiorari and supersedeas to bring up such an execution, and to have it quashed on the ground that it is void or voidable, but it has no jurisdiction to bring up the cause for a new trial, because the jurisdiction for that purpose is in the county in which the judgment was rendered.

                  Circuit court erred in dismissing a judgment debtor's motion for relief from a judgment entered against him in a general sessions court because, while the motion was filed approximately eight years after the judgment was entered and the trial court held that it lacked jurisdiction based on the expiration of the statutory 10-day time period, the judgment debtor's averments created a dispute of fact regarding whether proper service was achieved, and the parties should be allowed to develop an evidentiary record concerning the question of whether the judgment creditor properly served the judgment debtor.

The amendment by ch. 324, if it had taken effect, would have amended subdivision (a)(1) to read: “Effective September 1, 2006, general sessions judges in counties of the first class shall be paid a salary equivalent to ninety-seven and one-half percent (97.5%) of the salary paid to a circuit court judge.”

                 For the remainder of the judge's original term, the salary of the general sessions judge in a first class county who took office in 1996 for the remainder of a term that began in 1990 was determined as follows: (1) A base salary of $ 70,000 salary, plus annual adjustments to the base; (2) As of 1996, this figure included all of the annual adjustments made through July 1, 1995, for that salary due before July 1, 1996, and all the annual adjustments made through July 1, 1996, for the salary due thereafter; and (3) Annual adjustments would then be added the subsequent July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998, OAG 01-029 (3/5/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 For a new term beginning in 1998, the salary of the general sessions judge in a first class county who took office in 1996 for the remainder of a term that began in 1990 was determined as follows: (1) A $ 70,000 base salary, plus all annual adjustments due until July 1, 1998; and (2) To this sum was added the one-time increase of $ 10,000 effective September 1, 1998, OAG 01-029 (3/5/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Excluding jurisdictional supplements from the salary for judges in counties that have moved into counties of the first class as a result of the 2000 census does not violate legislative intent that judges in the same class counties with the same jurisdictions be paid equal salaries, OAG 01-107 (6/29/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 The equal protection clause of U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1 is not violated by the calculation of salaries of different general sessions judges exercising the same jurisdiction in counties of the first class in different manners, i.e, by judges who were receiving supplements under former T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-205" target="_self">16-15-205</a></cite> and Opinion 94-44 and who were reelected to office receiving a salary that continues to reflect those supplements, while judges in counties that moved into the first class as a result of the 2000 census receiving a salary that does not reflect those supplements, OAG 01-107 (6/29/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Where a judge in a county of the sixth class received an increase equal to 20 percent of the salary the judge was actually receiving as of August 31, 1998, and that county, under the 2000 census results, becomes a county of the fifth class, the judge's salary from 2000 on should not include an increase equal to 20 percent of the salary that judge would have been receiving if the county had been in the fifth class as of August 31, 1998, OAG 01-108 (6/29/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Where the increase in the consumer price index during a year was three percent, a judge is entitled to an adjustment of one percent, rather than one and one-half percent, as T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003" target="_self">16-15-5003</a></cite> provides that an adjustment will be made to reflect two percent incremental changes, OAG 01-108 (6/29/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Where, under the results of the 2000 census, a county became a county in the first class for purposes of calculating its general sessions judge's salary, the judge's new salary would be the $ 70,000 base for class one judges, increased by cost of living increases payable under T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003ol1f" target="_self">16-15-5003(f)</a></cite> (now T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003ol1e" target="_self">16-15-5003(e)</a></cite>) to July 30, 1998, plus $ 10,000 or 20 percent of the salary the judge was actually receiving as of August 31, 1998, whichever was greater, OAG 01-109 (7/6/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 The equal protection clauses of the Tennessee and United States Constitution are not violated to the extent that T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003" target="_self">16-15-5003</a></cite> provides for different salaries for judges in counties of the first class who exercise the same jurisdiction since the discrepancies provided for by the statute are rationally related to a legitimate state interest in retaining experienced judges, OAG 01-110 (7/6/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 To the extent that the statute provides for different salaries for judges in counties of the first class who exercise the same jurisdiction, the statute is not internally inconsistent or contradictory as it provides that differently situated judges in counties of the first class will receive different salary levels, OAG 01-110 (7/6/01).
                </p>
                <p>
                 In a county which was a sixth class county under the 1990 census and which becomes a fifth class county under the 2000 census, the new salary for its general sessions judge is the base salary for a judge in a county of the fifth class, plus cost-of-living increases to the base under T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003ol1f" target="_self">16-15-5003(f)</a></cite> (now T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003ol1e" target="_self">16-15-5003(e)</a></cite>), plus the increase the judge actually received on September 1, 1998, and applicable jurisdictional supplements for a judge in a county of the fifth class, plus cost-of-living increases under T.C.A. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003ol1i3" target="_self">16-15-5003(i)(3)</a></cite> (now T.C.A. §  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c15s16-15-5003ol1h3" target="_self">16-15-5003(h)(3)</a></cite>),OAG 01-122 (8/7/01).

                  General sessions judge received jurisdiction over mental health commitments by operation of law under Tenn. Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.37.html#t37c01s37-1-203" target="_blank">37-1-203</a></cite> and thus was entitled to a salary supplement for the exercise of that jurisdiction in addition to the salary supplement received for the exercise of juvenile jurisdiction, even though the exercise of the latter jurisdiction was a necessary prerequisite to the exercise of mental health commitment jurisdiction.

                  Each county shall be responsible for paying the base salary, any supplements and any annual adjustments for all of the general sessions judges in the county. Counties are authorized to impose a local litigation tax on each civil case filed in general sessions court, or in a court where the general sessions judge serves as judge, except juvenile court, and are authorized to impose a local litigation tax on each criminal conviction in general sessions court. In order for the tax to be effective, it must be approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the county legislative body of any county wishing to impose it. Its approval by the county legislative body must be proclaimed by the presiding officer of the body and certified by the presiding officer to the secretary of state. The litigation tax authorized by this section may be effective on or after July 1, 1990, and may be in any amount up to six dollars ($6.00) per case. Proceeds of the litigation tax shall be paid to the county general fund. It is the intent of the general assembly that the proceeds of this local tax aid in defraying the cost to counties of paying the general sessions court judges. If, during any fiscal year, the amount of revenue generated by the local tax enacted pursuant to this section does not sufficiently fund the increase in the general sessions judge's compensation mandated by this part or the salary supplement as provided for under § 16-15-205(d)(2) [repealed], the local litigation tax may be raised to an amount more than six dollars ($6.00) necessary to fund the increase mandated by this part or the salary supplement as provided for under § 16-15-205(d)(2) [repealed]; provided, that any increase to fund the supplement shall be adjusted annually.

        The county courts are wholly wanting in common law powers. Nashville &amp; K. R. Co. v. Wilson County, 89 Tenn. 597, 15 S.W. 446, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1891); Shelby County v. Tennessee Centennial Exposition Co., 96 Tenn. 653, 36 S.W. 694, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 19, <cite class="lra">33 L.R.A. 717</cite> (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        County courts are constituted corporations and can exercise only such powers as may be entrusted to them by the legislature. Wright v. State, 171 Tenn. 628, 106 S.W.2d 866, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county courts of Tennessee are recognized by the Constitution but they possess no judicial jurisdiction other than that conferred by statute. Dick v. Dick, 223 Tenn. 228, 443 S.W.2d 472, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (1969), overruled in part, Browne v. Browne, 547 S.W.2d 239, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1977).

       <p>
        The powers “entrusted to” the county courts emanate from the legislature alone; hence, when a power claimed for them is not so conferred, it must be held not to exist. Nashville &amp; K. R. Co. v. Wilson County, 89 Tenn. 597, 15 S.W. 446, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1891); Shelby County v. Tennessee Centennial Exposition Co., 96 Tenn. 653, 36 S.W. 694, 1896 Tenn.

       <p>
        The statutes make it clear that the county court is the probate court. The 1978 constitutional amendments superseded this court. Viewed realistically the probate court is just as much a part of our judicial system as the juvenile court. Probate judges are county officers. Marion County Bd. of Comm'rs v. Marion County Election Com., 594 S.W.2d 681, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (Tenn. 1980).

        The jurisdiction of the county courts is limited in the presence of controverted and disputed issues which may not be resolved by simple calculation or in a summary manner. Dick v. Dick, 223 Tenn. 228, 443 S.W.2d 472, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (1969), overruled in part, Browne v. Browne, 547 S.W.2d 239, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1977).

       <p>
        At the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1870, the county court consisted of the justices of the county held monthly and divided into a quarterly court held by all or any number of the justices necessary to transact business and a quorum court held by three or more of the justices designated at the quarterly session, the quorum court in counties authorized to elect a county judge being abolished and the jurisdiction and powers thereof vested in the county judge. Davis v. Williams, 158 Tenn. 34, 12 S.W.2d 532, 1928 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1928).

       <p>
        The proceedings in matters of probate and administration, or in other matters where the county court's jurisdiction is original, general, and exclusive, are as conclusive as the proceedings of other superior courts, and if its judgment is valid on its face, it can only be attacked in a direct proceeding for that purpose; and every intendment is in favor of the county court's such jurisdiction, and the rightful exercise of it. Brien v. Hart, 25 Tenn. 131, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1845); Townsend v. Townsend, 44 Tenn. 70, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1867); Carr v. Lowe's Ex'rs, 54 Tenn. 84, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 418 (1871); Andrews v. Andrews, 54 Tenn. 234, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1872); Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882); Posey v. Eaton, 77 Tenn. 500, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1882); Railway Co. V. Mahoney, 89 Tenn. 311, 15 S.W. 652, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1890); Eller v. Richardson, 89 Tenn. 575, 15 S.W. 650, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1891); Franklin v. Franklin, 91 Tenn. 119, 18 S.W. 61, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court is not a court of general jurisdiction, but its jurisdiction is statutory and limited, and no presumption is made in its favor, or rather nothing shall be intended to be within its jurisdiction unless it so appear. Linnville v. Darby, 60 Tenn. 306, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 496 (1873); Leonard v. Haynes, 82 Tenn. 447, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (1884); Nashville & K. R. Co. v.

        County court is not an inferior court, especially in its general and exclusive jurisdiction, but it is established and its jurisdiction defined by the general law of the land. Campbell v. M'Iver, 5 Tenn. 60 (1817); Fields v. State, 8 Tenn. 167, 8 Tenn. 168, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1827); Brien v. Hart, 25 Tenn. 131, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1845); Pope v. Harrison, 84 Tenn. 82, 1885 Tenn.

        County court's jurisdiction is limited as to some matters and general as to others. Brewer v. Griggs, 10 Tenn. App. 378, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 46 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929).

        County courts have original jurisdiction in the matter of probating wills and in granting letters testamentary and of administration and the repeal and revocation thereof, and as to these subjects, county courts are not inferior courts in the common law acceptance of that term. Walker v. Verble, 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 651 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court in the matter of probate of wills and grants of administration is a court of general jurisdiction but has special and limited jurisdiction over an inquisition of lunacy or a sale of land for the payment of debts. Brewer v. Griggs, 10 Tenn. App. 378, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 46 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929).

       <p>
        None of the matters in which the county court is given jurisdiction are matters coming within the jurisdiction of common law courts as they existed at common law and, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, it proceeds as a court of equity. In re Wolf, 188 F. 519, 1911 U.S. App. LEXIS 4343 (C.C.D. Tenn. 1911).

        The court may, on petition, revoke its own improvident grant of letters testamentary and of administration, and annul its own judgment; but the appointee must have due notice of the proceeding. State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was not entitled to file bill in chancery for removal of administrator appointed by the county court on the ground that deceased was not a resident of the county, since county court had original and exclusive jurisdiction over appointment and revocation of letters testamentary and administration. Bellenfant v. American Nat'l Bank, 184 Tenn. 50, 195 S.W.2d 30, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 259 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wherever there is doubt as to the question of original jurisdiction in the granting and revocation of letters of administration within the provisions of this section that doubt should be resolved in favor of the original jurisdiction of the county court. Fox v. Commerce Union Bank, 186 Tenn. 181, 209 S.W.2d 1, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 534 (1948).

        Chancery court does not have authority to appoint an administrator ad litem for an estate on the ground that bank acting as administrator of estate was also acting as liquidator of business formerly operated by deceased, since authority to appoint an administrator was in the court administering the estate.

        County court has jurisdiction to dispose of exceptions to accounts of executors, and it is not necessary to appeal to the circuit or chancery court as in case of insolvent estates. Gaines v. Eason, 130 Tenn. 86, 169 S.W. 309, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        While county court has no jurisdiction of a petition to require an administrator to charge himself with a sum with which he had charged himself as administrator of another estate, when considered as an independent and original action drawing into the question the title to property, it has jurisdiction. Black v. Black, 134 Tenn. 517, 184 S.W. 27, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 175 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court possesses the necessary authority and has the requisite facilities to have a full and complete accounting with an administrator, making all proper charges against him, and allowing him credit for all items to which he is entitled. In re Love's Estate, 176 Tenn. 696, 145 S.W.2d 778, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The probate court or the circuit or chancery court on appeal has jurisdiction to determine whether an administrator should be charged with the particular item on an exception to the inventory and settlement although the administrator insisted the item did not belong to the estate. Teague v. Gooch, 206 Tenn. 291, 333 S.W.2d 1, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 364 (1960).

        Generally both the county and chancery courts are vested with jurisdiction in the appointment and removal of personal representatives and administration of decedents' estates. Dick v. Dick, 223 Tenn. 228, 443 S.W.2d 472, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (1969), overruled in part, Browne v. Browne, 547 S.W.2d 239, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although as a general rule both the county court and chancery court are vested with jurisdiction in the administration of decedents' estates, in instances of serious disputes or complications the chancery court may assume jurisdiction of the administration of an estate although the county court has previously undertaken such administration. Dick v. Dick, 223 Tenn. 228, 443 S.W.2d 472, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (1969), overruled in part, Browne v. Browne, 547 S.W.2d 239, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1977).

        All doubts as to jurisdiction of matters involving administration of an estate should be resolved in favor of county court. Fox v. Commerce Union Bank, 186 Tenn. 181, 209 S.W.2d 1, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 534 (1948).

        The county court in the exercise of its probate jurisdiction has the authority to adjudicate conflicting claims of ownership and right of possession to personal property which is claimed both by the representatives of a decedent's estate and by third parties who claim title, not through the decedent and his representative, but from another source. Browne v. Browne, 547 S.W.2d 239, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. 1977).

        Where contestant in petition filed in county court attacked holographic will executed in 1937 and stated that it was not the true will and that instrument executed in 1917 with codicil attached was the true will and prayed “that original document executed in 1917 be certified to circuit court in order that an issue may be made as to whether it is the last will and testament of deceased” the circuit court had jurisdiction to determine which will was the valid will, and upon verdict of jury that estate should be distributed under terms of 1917 will certify that fact to the county court for further steps in administration.

This section does not confer such jurisdiction, and it cannot be conferred by answering and submitting to same. Walsh v. Crook, 91 Tenn. 388, 19 S.W. 19, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1892); Tucker v. Tucker, 100 Tenn. 310, 45 S.W. 344, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court must determine the question of conflicting titles, whenever the heirs or any one else may intervene and set up claims to the lands sought to be sold, and the court may decree any lands to be sold that shall appear from the record to have belonged to the decedent, and the purchaser at such sale will acquire such title, and such only, as belonged to the decedent, for such determination will not operate as res judicata in any subsequent action between the purchaser and one claiming adversely to the title of the decedent. Such adverse claimant may resist the title of the purchaser under such decree when sued, or may prefer a bill to have such purchaser's title canceled and removed as a cloud. Walsh v. Crook, 91 Tenn. 388, 19 S.W. 19, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1892).

         Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the probate of a will where nothing in the appellate record indicated that a will contest had been filed, and thus, subject matter jurisdiction was vested exclusively in probate court. Although a circuit court judge could sit by interchange in the probate court, in the instant case the case had been transferred to circuit court based on the court orders and the circuit court's actions. As a result, the circuit court's orders and actions were invalid for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In re Estate of Ellis, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 564 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 14, 2020).

      Attorney General Opinions. If a probationer satisfied the requirements of participation in the “drug court program,” and participation in the program was ordered as a modification of the conditions of probation pursuant to a revocation hearing, then a drug court could assume jurisdiction over the probation by transfer of the probation to the drug court, OAG 03-164 (12/23/03).
     </p>
     <p>
      As long as participation in the “drug court program” was ordered as a condition of the probation after a revocation hearing, defendant satisfied the criteria for participation in the program, and the case was one where the general sessions and circuit courts had concurrent jurisdiction, then a drug court would be able to accept a transfer of probation for a misdemeanant sentenced to probation in a general sessions court, OAG 03-164 (12/23/03).
     </p>
     <p>
      As circuit courts are courts of general jurisdiction and maintain exclusive original jurisdiction over criminal matters, a circuit court or drug court created by a circuit court would have subject matter jurisdiction over any criminal case in that judicial district, OAG 03-164 (12/23/03).
     </p>
     <p>
      Just as a sentence of probation may be transferred from one jurisdiction to another, there is nothing in the Tennessee code that would prevent a sentence of probation from being transferred from one division of a circuit court to another, OAG 03-164 (12/23/03).
