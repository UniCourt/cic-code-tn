       <p>
        The replication to the special plea of retainer, when the defendant is not the rightful executor, would be that he was an executor of his own wrong, and the burden rests upon the defendant to prove his plea by producing his letters testamentary. Partee v. Caughran, 17 Tenn. 460, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1836).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a party sued as executor fails to plead he was never such but relies upon other defenses, it is an admission that he is executor, but where defendant pleads that he was never executor, and puts in various other pleas in addition thereto, he does not by such pleading commit himself as an executor of his own wrong, where no such acts were proved against him as in law constitute a wrongful executorship.

        The alleged representative character of the plaintiff as executor or administrator is admitted by the general issue, and must be contested by a special plea that plaintiff is not and never was administrator. Cheek v. Wheatly, 30 Tenn. 556, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (1851); McMillan Marble Co. v. Black, 89 Tenn. 118, 14 S.W. 479, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1890); Railway Co. V. Mahoney, 89 Tenn. 311, 15 S.W. 652, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appointment by the probate court is not subject to collateral attack, and is binding on all of the world until reversed by proper appellate court, or until revoked by the probate court. State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886); Railway Co. V. Mahoney, 89 Tenn. 311, 15 S.W. 652, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1890); Eller v. Richardson, 89 Tenn. 575, 15 S.W. 650, 1890 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        The grant and appointment when made by the probate court having jurisdiction is res judicata and conclusive, upon collateral attack, though the appointment was made without citation of the next of kin. State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886).

       <p>
        The probate court of the county in which the deceased had his residence and domicile at the time of his death has jurisdiction to grant letters testamentary and of administration, but such letters granted by the probate court of some other county are merely voidable, and cannot be collaterally attacked upon the ground that they were so granted. Pinkerton v. Walker, 4 Tenn. 220, 4 Tenn. 221, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1817); Johnson v. Gains, 41 Tenn. 288, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1860); Posey v. Eaton, 77 Tenn. 500, 1882 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the executor, who is also a testamentary trustee and guardian under the same will, dies, the chancery court is the proper tribunal to appoint a proper person to execute the trusts of the will and to act as such guardian. Drane v. Bayliss, 20 Tenn. 174, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1839).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdiction of the probate court over the subject of administration is not special or limited, but general, original and exclusive. Brien v. Hart, 25 Tenn. 131, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1845); Johnson v. Gains, 41 Tenn. 288, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1860); Carr v. Lowe's Ex'rs, 54 Tenn. 84, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 418 (1871); Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Every presumption is in favor of jurisdiction of probate court to make an appointment. Franklin v. Franklin, 91 Tenn. 119, 18 S.W. 61, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1892); Dayton Coal & I. Co. v. Dodd, 188 F. 597, 1911 U.S. App. LEXIS 4350, 37 L.R.A. (n.s.) 456 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no authority for the appointment of administrators by the circuit court, not even in cases appealed to that court. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly acted within its discretion in transferring a probate action to another county based on a skilled nursing facility's contention that the decedent resided in that county at the time of his death; the statute has been utilized to transfer actions to the proper court with jurisdiction rather than dismissing the action when the original court has been determined to lack jurisdiction because venue was localized. In re Estate of Salmons, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 130 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2018).

        The grant of administration upon the estate of a living person, as well as the appointment of an administrator in such case, is absolutely void, and a debtor of such living person is not protected in the payment of his indebtedness, though made in good faith and by compulsion of a judgment of court. Pinson v. Ivey, 9 Tenn. 296, 1830 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1830); D'Arusment v. Jones, 72 Tenn. 251, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1880); Shown v. McMackin, 77 Tenn. 601, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 109, 42 Am. Rep. 680 (1882).

       <p>
        Grant of administration upon the estate of a decedent as an intestate is not void where will is found, but voidable; and may be revoked where a will is found and probated, but the acts of the administrator, in due course of administration, are nevertheless valid, and protect those properly and in good faith dealing with him. Pinkerton v. Walker, 4 Tenn. 220, 4 Tenn. 221, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1817); Franklin v. Franklin, 91 Tenn. 119, 18 S.W. 61, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1892).

        Administration once granted will not be arbitrarily revoked, though it was improvidently granted. M'Gowan v. Wade, 11 Tenn. 374, 11 Tenn. 375, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1832); Wilson v. Frazier, 21 Tenn. 30, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1840); Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842); Feltz v. Clark, 23 Tenn. 79, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1843); State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of the probate court to revoke the grant of letters in a proper case is well settled in this state. M'Gowan v. Wade, 11 Tenn. 374, 11 Tenn. 375, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1832); Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842); Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882); Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        The next of kin have the right, as against a public administrator, to administer within six months from the death of the intestate, and letters granted to the public administrator within the six months, while not void, may be revoked at the instance of the next of kin within that period. Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882).

       <p>
        Proceedings to revoke letters of administration must originate in the probate court granting the same, and not by appointment of one with a superior right of preference to the administration, made in another probate court, and by his petition for certiorari in the circuit court for certification of the proceedings in the probate court. Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842); Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882); Rice v. Henly, 90 Tenn. 69, 15 S.W. 748, 1890 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        The application for the revocation must be made by petition against the previously appointed administrator, and the issuance and service of citation on such administrator. However, such administrator's appearance in court, and the submission of the matter to the court, is a waiver of the necessity for the citation. Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842).
       </p>
       <p>
        Letters of administration, improvidently granted to a person not entitled thereto, will be revoked, upon formal application by petition of one entitled to the administration. Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842); State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886).

        A railroad company has such interest in the administration of the estate of the decedent as entitles it to file and maintain a petition to revoke the letters of administration granted here, upon the ground that the probate court was without jurisdiction to grant administration. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Herb, 125 Tenn. 408, 143 S.W. 1138, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was not entitled to file bill in chancery for removal of administrator appointed by the probate court on the ground that deceased was not a resident of the county, since probate court had original and exclusive jurisdiction over appointment and revocation of letters testamentary and of administration. Bellenfant v. American Nat'l Bank, 184 Tenn. 50, 195 S.W.2d 30, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 259 (1946).

        The court may exercise power to revoke grant of letters for sufficient cause, as where the administrator abuses his trust, or where it is evidently for the benefit of the estate. M'Gowan v. Wade, 11 Tenn. 374, 11 Tenn. 375, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1832); Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842); Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882); Rodes v.

       <p>
        Letters of administration granted to a creditor or even to a stanger, five years after the intestate's death, and after the death of his widow, will not be revoked, upon application of the next of kin claiming priority of right to the administration, in the absence of some good reason for their delay in asking for letters of administration. Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1901).

       <p>
        Where, what is usually termed a special, limited, or ancillary administration on the estate of a nonresident is granted here to the personal representative of the estate in the state of the decedent's domicile, such administrator is expressly included in the words “executor or administrator,” and such administration stands upon the same footing as other administrations. Our statutes do not provide for such administration as a distinct species. Carr v. Lowe's Ex'rs, 54 Tenn. 84, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 418 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word “assets,” as used in the administration statutes, usually means items subject to payment of the debts of decedent, but it is not wholly limited to this meaning and has been applied to money collected by an administrator as damages for the wrongful killing of an intestate, since the administrator owes a duty to distributees as well as to creditors. Sharp v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 133 Tenn. 1, 179 S.W. 375, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word “estate” means the whole legal entity which may be the subject of devolution on the legatees, devisees, heirs, or distributees of a decedent, under the laws of the state government, which, under such laws, may be attacked or defended, or to obtain which a suit may be brought. Sharp v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 133 Tenn. 1, 179 S.W. 375, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1915).

        The property, real or personal, of a nonresident decedent, situated within the jurisdiction of this state at the time of his death, may be administered here under our insolvency laws, notwithstanding the estate of such deceased person in the place of his domicile is solvent. Gilchrist v. Cannon, 41 Tenn. 581, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1860); Moorehead v. Diemer, 61 Tenn. 153, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 354 (1872); Smith v. St. Louis Mut. Life Ins. Co., 74 Tenn. 564, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 293 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a nonresident became an inmate of a national home for disabled soldiers, located on land ceded by the state to the federal government, and died there, the probate court in the county in which that home is located and in which county the decedent died, leaving certificates of deposit of a bank in that county, has probate jurisdiction of his estate, and an administrator appointed by such court has authority to compel the officers of such home to deliver to him the personal property and assets of the decedent. Divine v. Unaka Nat'l Bank, 125 Tenn. 98, 140 S.W. 747, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 9, 36 L.R.A. (n.s.) 586 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute makes the right of administration dependent upon the location of the property at the death of deceased, and if it be removed without authority, administration may still be had, and the responsible parties made to answer for such removal. Anderson v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 128 Tenn. 244, 159 S.W. 1086, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1913); Coffey v. Durand, 27 Tenn. App. 704, 167 S.W.2d 684, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 96 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        An administrator may be appointed in the county in which a nonresident was wrongfully killed, though the cause of action for the wrongful death was the only asset in the county, and there were no technical assets. Sharp v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 133 Tenn. 1, 179 S.W. 375, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1915).

        Administration may be granted here for the collection of a judgment rendered in favor of the decedent, whose domicile was in another state against the debtor then residing there, but afterwards, removing to this state, and residing here both at the death of the judgment creditor and when application for grant of administration was made here. Swancy v. Scott, 28 Tenn. 327, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1848); St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878); Smith v. Smith, 83 Tenn. 93, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1885).

       <p>
        Under this section the grant of a limited or special administration does not prevent grant of a general administration, in a proper case, to a different person. Jordan v. Polk, 33 Tenn. 430, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1853).
       </p>
       <p>
        The administration upon the estate of a nonresident decedent granted in this state is an administration commensurate with the limits of the state, and the administrator is the proper representative of the intestate as to all his property and effects situated in this state at the time of his death.

        Where a distinct and independent administration has been granted in another state, the jurisdiction of the situs of certain chattels and effects of a decedent, and such jurisdiction has attached to them, they cannot be brought into the administration in this state, so as to render the sureties of the administrator here liable therefor. This rule is not affected by the fact that the same person was appointed administrator in both states, where the sureties are different. Case of Andrews' Heirs, 22 Tenn. 592, 1842 Tenn.

        The administrator of another state, who has recovered a judgment there, in his name as administrator of the decedent, against a debtor of the decedent, may maintain suit, in his individual capacity, in this state, upon the judgment, without describing himself as administrator, and without obtaining grant of administration in this state, and if he names himself as administrator, such designation will be treated as mere description of the person, and the record will, in either case, sustain the action upon the plea of nul tiel record. Hunt v. Lyle, 14 Tenn. 412, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1834); Swancy v. Scott, 28 Tenn. 327, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1848); Page v. Cravens, 40 Tenn. 383, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1859).

        A foreign executor or administrator has no right or power in this state to intermeddle with the decedent's estate here, and he has no authority to collect the assets or debts, and can neither sue nor be sued here in his character as executor or administrator. Allsup v. Allsup's Heirs, 18 Tenn. 283, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1837); Keaton's Distributees v. Campbell, 21 Tenn. 224, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1840); Sparks v. White, 26 Tenn. 86, 1846 Tenn.

       <p>
        While a foreign executor or administrator cannot maintain suits in our courts, he may indorse or assign negotiable or assignable paper, held there by the decedent, at the time of his death, and thus pass the legal title to the indorsee or assignee, who may, in his own name, sue, in our courts, the debtor residing here, especially if no objection is made upon the ground of local administration granted here.

        A foreign executor or administrator is, by comity allowed to set up his claim to life policies left in his state at the time of the death of the insured there, but subsequently brought into this state and sued upon by an administrator appointed in this state. Ellis v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., 100 Tenn. 177, 43 S.W. 766, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 100 (1897).

        A foreign administrator must also qualify in Tennessee in order to administer upon assets located within Tennessee. Coffey v. Durand, 27 Tenn. App. 704, 167 S.W.2d 684, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 96 (1940).

        Where a testatrix died domiciled in another state the appointment of an administrator in that state conferred no jurisdiction on such administrator to administer the assets of the estate in Tennessee. Fisher v. Durand, 179 Tenn. 635, 169 S.W.2d 671, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1940).

        Appointment of administrator in New York did not give him authority to maintain action for alleged wrongful death of decedent in county of accident in Tennessee without obtaining letters of administration in that county.

        Tennessee creditor of a testatrix who died domiciled in another state leaving assets in Tennessee was not obligated to file a claim in the courts of such other state in order to subject the Tennessee assets to such claim, and where such creditor did not subject himself to the jurisdiction of the courts of such other state and was not a party to the probate proceeding of such state, the probate proceedings in such state were not res judicata as to such creditor so as to prevent him from maintaining suit in Tennessee against an administrator appointed under the provisions of this section. Fisher v. Durand, 179 Tenn. 635, 169 S.W.2d 671, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1940).

        An executor or administrator has no title or authority over the asserts in another state or country and he is not responsible therefore. Swancy v. Scott, 28 Tenn. 327, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1848); Young v. O'Neal, 35 Tenn. 55, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1855); Carr v. Lowe's Ex'rs, 54 Tenn. 84, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 418 (1871); Nelson v. Trigg, 3 Shan. 733 (1877); St. John v.

        The administrator in the state where the decedent died, leaving negotiable or assignable notes there, is entitled to them, though the debtor resides in another jurisdiction where there is another administration. Swancy v. Scott, 28 Tenn. 327, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1848); St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878); Goodlett v. Anderson, 75 Tenn. 286, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1881); Ellis v.

       <p>
        In the conflict between the rights of the indorsee or assignee of the foreign executor or administrator and that of the domestic administrator where the debtor resides, the title of the domestic administrator, it seems, must be regarded as paramount, if the debt be assets here where the debtor resides, because the title of the domestic administrator is prior, and, therefore, superior to that of the indorsee or assignee, acquired by transfer from the foreign administrator. Swancy v. Scott, 28 Tenn. 327, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the holder of negotiable or assignable notes dies while domiciled in another state, but leaving such notes in the jurisdiction of this state, where the debtor resides, administration may be granted on his estate here, for the collection and administration of such notes. Young v. O'Neal, 35 Tenn. 55, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1855); St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878); Goodlett v. Anderson, 75 Tenn. 286, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1881).

       <p>
        Under this section the Tennessee administrator of a testatrix who died domiciled in another state was the proper representative of the deceased for all her property situated in this state at the time of her death, and the appointment of an administrator by the state of decedent's domicile conferred no jurisdiction on such foreign administrator to administer the assets of deceased in Tennessee. Fisher v. Durand, 179 Tenn. 635, 169 S.W.2d 671, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1940).

        Where the resident administrator pays over the surplus funds to the foreign executor or administrator in the state or country of the decedent's domicile, such payment may be a bar in a court of equity when the rights of domestic creditors do not intervene, and the heirs and distributees or devisees and legatees are not prejudiced in their rights.

        If administration of a nonresident's estate is necessary in this state, our court will make the debts to the estate of nonresident assets for the benefit of domestic creditors, and not allow them to be removed without the payment of our own creditors, if there be such. St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878); Goodlett v. Anderson, 75 Tenn. 286, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1881).

        Policies of life insurance upon decedent's life payable at his death to his executors, administrators, or assigns, cannot be drawn into this state for recovery by suit and for administration and distribution under our statutes, by having an administrator appointed in this state to obtain physical possession of the policies and bring them into this state, even though the policies are actually brought into and sued on in our courts.

        A pistol, a gold watch, a gold badge of an order, and money belonging to a deceased nonresident were subject to administration, and none of them was exempt, although subsequent to his death someone, without authority, sent such property to his widow in another state, since the parties responsible could be made to answer for such removal.

        A resident debtor's voluntary payment of notes left here by a decedent dying domiciled in another state, made to the foreign executor or administrator, is no bar to an action for the same debt, subsequently brought by a domestic administrator subsequently appointed. Young v. O'Neal, 35 Tenn. 55, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1855); St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878).

       <p>
        Where a resident debtor to a nonresident decedent happens to be temporarily in the state of the domicile of the deceased, and while there voluntarily pays the debt to the executor or administrator of the estate of such decedent, the payment is good, a valid discharge of the debt, and a protection of the debtor, because he was there subject to be sued. Young v. O'Neal, 35 Tenn. 55, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1855); St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the debtor and creditor or both reside in the same state or country at the time of the creditor's death, and administration is granted in that state or country, as the debt is properly due there, and rightfully falls within that administration, it may be voluntarily paid to administrator in decedent's domicile by the debtor in another state or country, if he should afterwards change his domicile. Young v. O'Neal, 35 Tenn. 55, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        A resident debtor's voluntary payment to a foreign administrator who had been appointed at the domicile of the intestate, made at the place of the debtor's residence, is good as against an ancillary administrator subsequently appointed at the place of the debtor's residence, where the foreign administrator duly accounted for such payment, and where there were no creditors or distributees of the intestate in the state of such debtor's domicile.

        The probate court's grant of administration to one is prima facie evidence of the appointee's right to administer, and the appointment should not be revoked, nor the letters recalled, without evidence that he was not entitled to the administration, and that another was so entitled. Wilson v. Hoss, 22 Tenn. 142, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1842); Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1901).

        A special or limited administration upon the estate of a nonresident decedent for a certain specific purpose, or to prosecute or defend a certain suit, is not within the letter or spirit of the statute prescribing to whom general administration shall be granted. Jordan v. Polk, 33 Tenn. 430, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1853).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions do not apply to the appointment of an administrator de bonis non with the will annexed, and one interested in the administration of the property under the will, or who is favored by those so interested, or by a large majority of the interests, is to be preferred to the widow and next of kin of the testator, where such widow and next of kin are neither interested in the estate to be administered nor preferred by those so interested. Word v. Shofner, 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 401 (1910).

       <p>
        Decedent's mother filed her petition three days following decedent's funeral and less than two weeks following his death, and no evidence showed a want of application by decedent's wife or daughter other than the fact that no petition to open the estate had yet been filed; a delay of two weeks following a death was not sufficient without other proof to show that the spouse and next-of-kin had failed to administer the estate. The mother was not a beneficiary and was nothing more than a stranger to the estate. In re Estate of Edmonds, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 272 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 30, 2019).

        The statutory preference cannot continue indefinitely, and while this statute does not fix any period of limitation, it would be safe and reasonable to limit such right to six months. Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882); Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where applicants in the different classes are equally fit, the statute is mandatory in the preference prescribed. Fitzgerald v. Smith, 112 Tenn. 176, 78 S.W. 1050, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The next of kin, unless unfitness is made to appear, is entitled to preference over the creditors, but the personal fitness of the applicants, in matters not involving legal disabilities, will be considered by the court in selecting between applicants of the same degree of kindred to the deceased, and may be of sufficient importance to justify the court in appointing one more remotely related, and the same considerations may justify the court in appointing one in a class more remotely preferred, as, for instance the largest creditor, when more fit and suitable. Fitzgerald v. Smith, 112 Tenn. 176, 78 S.W. 1050, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial judge held the statutory preference in the appointment of administrators to be absolutely mandatory, and, yielding to this holding, counsel failed to introduce any evidence to show the superior qualifications of the applicant more remotely preferred, and to show the disqualifications of the applicant primarily preferred, a new trial will granted because of the lower court's erroneous holding.

        Personal fitness of applicants for administration should be considered by the court and may be of sufficient importance to justify a court in disregarding the statutory order of preference and appointing a suitable party. Williams v. Stewart, 166 Tenn. 615, 64 S.W.2d 194, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 125 (1933); Commerce Union Bank v. Fox, 28 Tenn. App. 587, 192 S.W.2d 233, 1945 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1945).

        By the enactment of this section, the legislature meant to prefer the members of the family in providing for the granting of letters of administration. Commerce Union Bank v. Fox, 28 Tenn. App. 587, 192 S.W.2d 233, 1945 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        In providing for the granting of letters of administration, the legislature meant to prefer those who are closer to the deceased by blood ties and right of property, so that members of the family who inherit the estate are preferred over creditors and strangers. Tudor v. Southern Trust Co., 193 Tenn. 331, 246 S.W.2d 33, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 295 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Relatives who would inherit nothing have no standing in court to be appointed administrator or to remove an administrator already appointed, where they have no interest as next of kin or distributees. Cravens v. Cravens, 54 Tenn. App. 487, 392 S.W.2d 825, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court was not persuaded by the mother's argument that whether she was properly appointed under the statute was irrelevant to the consideration of whether she could be removed; both the decedent's wife and daughter had a statutory preference to administer the estate far stronger than any claim by the mother, and although the wife declined, the guardian of the daughter accepted the appointment. The preference statute appeared to favor the appointment of the guardian in the absence of some unfitness as found by the trial court. In re Estate of Edmonds, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 272 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 30, 2019).

        There is particular propriety in giving the widow preference in granting letters of administration, where she is entitled to the whole of the personal estate, after the payment of the debts. Swan v. Swan, 40 Tenn. 163, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        A widow, administering upon her deceased husband's estate, is entitled to the appointment of a prudent business man as an associate with herself in the administration, such as she may prefer, either at the time of her appointment or subsequently. Phillips v. Green, 51 Tenn. 350, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 173 (1871); Johnson v. Molsbee, 73 Tenn. 444, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1880).

        Application of widow after the appointment of a creditor, or even a stranger, five years after death of intestate, must be accompanied by satisfactory explanation of delay. Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1901).

        Widow who prior to husband's executed voluntary separation agreement waived any claim against husband's estate was not entitled to be appointed administratrix of estate. Cravens v. Cravens, 54 Tenn. App. 487, 392 S.W.2d 825, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).

        Where one of the next of kin applies for letters, and the application is opposed by the widow and most of the other next of kin, but none of them applies for administration, the court ought to appoint the applicant. Swan v. Swan, 40 Tenn. 163, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        The probate court exercises its discretion in selecting among the next of kin where there are several of them applying, or in appointing the person designated by a majority of them. Crozier v. Goodwin, 69 Tenn. 125, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1878); In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The preference given to the next of kin is waived by the failure to assert it within five years, without giving some good reason for the delay, and letters of administration, granted to a creditor of the estate, or even to a stranger, five years after the intestate's death, will not be revoked on application of the next of kin claiming the priority of right. Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision that the court may decide which of next of kin shall be entitled to administration, applies only where there are more than one next of kin of the same degree applying for administration. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The next of kin have the right to nominate another instead of one of themselves for appointment as administrator. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904); Word v. Shofner, 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 401 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        The probate court, upon denying the application by the next of kin for the appointment of their nominee as administrator, has no right, of its own motion, to appoint another as administrator, without giving the next of kin, and after them the creditors, an opportunity to present one of their number, or to nominate another for appointment. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The next of kin, by appealing from an order of the probate court refusing to appoint their nominee for administrator, and, of its own motion, appointing another, do not waive their right to make a second nomination, though the first nominee was held to be ineligible by the appellate court. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).

        The right to administer the estate of an intestate follows the right to the property comprising the estate, and reference to statutes of distribution will determine who is entitled to administer under the statutory preference given next of kin.

        Under this section the legislature meant to prefer the members of the family in providing for the granting of letters of administration because they are the ones who inherit the estate and are closer to the deceased by blood ties and by rights of property than creditors or strangers to the estate. Lakins v. Isley, 200 Tenn. 353, 292 S.W.2d 389, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 418 (1956); Cravens v. Cravens, 54 Tenn. App. 487, 392 S.W.2d 825, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).

        Counsel representing the executor in a will contest, and entitled to compensation for the services rendered, is a creditor of the estate for some amount, so as to be entitled to the appointment of administrator, after the will has been set aside.

        The attorney representing the bulk of the estate of a decedent, but at the same time obligated as such to carry into effect certain antagonistic agreements which would divert large amounts of the funds of the estate into channels different from the ordinary channels of distribution, is not eligible for the appointment as administrator, especially where the sanction of the chancery court for carrying such agreements into effect is required.

        Only the unsuccessful applicants can prosecute an appeal or certiorari, according to the circumstances, to the circuit court, from the order of the probate court appointing another as administrator. Wright's Distributees v. Wright, 8 Tenn. 43, 8 Tenn. 47, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1827).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appeal lies, and a trial de novo may be had in the circuit court. McClanahan v. McClanahan, 59 Tenn. 379, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 78 (1873); State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886); Fitzgerald v. Smith, 112 Tenn. 176, 78 S.W. 1050, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1904); In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        If prayer for an appeal be refused, writ of certiorari is the proper remedy to bring up the case for review. Williams v. Pointer, 71 Tenn. 366, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearings in circuit courts of appeals from probate court appointments of administrators or executors are de novo in nature rather than in the nature of writs of error, and therefore filing a bill of exceptions is not essential to circuit court review. Delffs v. Delffs, 545 S.W.2d 739, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        On assumption that minute entry must show that appeal from probate court was prayed for and granted, the phrase “upon motion of petitioner” was sufficient prayer and order that record be certified and sent to circuit court and was sufficient to show that appeal was granted. Delffs v. Delffs, 545 S.W.2d 739, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. 1977).

        While the appeal from the action of the probate court in the appointment of an administrator is pending in the circuit court, the court has jurisdiction and power to make all amendments, and, if necessary, to introduce new parties to determine the questions contested in the probate court, for the proceedings in the circuit court are de novo. However, the circuit court has no power to consider the application of anyone for the appointment, where such applicant was not an applicant or party to the contest in the probate court. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The circuit court cannot grant letters of administration, but, upon determination of the appeal, must remand the cause for the issuance of letters. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).

        The appellate court, reversing both the circuit court and the probate court in their unconditional refusal to revoke the grant of administration, without requiring the appointee to execute bond, which he had omitted to do, will remand the cause to the probate court, with directions to grant letters of administration to the petitioner according to law, unless the first appointee shall enter into bond as required by law. Feltz v. Clark, 23 Tenn. 79, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1843).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the probate court appointed an administrator, and, upon appeal, the circuit court erroneously reversed the judgment, the Supreme Court, reversing judgment of the circuit court, and affirming the appointment of the probate court, will give the judgment that the circuit court should have given, and will order its judgment to be certified to the probate court, with directions to proceed in the administration. Crozier v. Goodwin, 69 Tenn. 125, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the appellate court reverses the probate and circuit courts in their action in removing an administrator, and appointing a new administrator, it will enter a judgment canceling the letters of administration to such new administrator and declaring the right of the previously appointed administrator to continue in the administration. Rodes v. Boyers, 106 Tenn. 434, 61 S.W. 776, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the circuit court correctly reversed the judgment of the probate court in its appointment of an administrator, but erroneously appointed another as administrator, the appellate court, affirming the circuit court's reversal of the probate court and reversing the circuit court's action in such appointment of a new applicant, will remand the cause to the circuit court, with instructions to issue a procedendo to the probate court, directing it to appoint an administrator, in accord with the rules laid down in the opinion. In re Wooten's Estate, 114 Tenn. 289, 85 S.W. 1105, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1904).

        Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to appoint an administrator for the estate and thus the order was void. Owens v. Muenzel, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 752 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 21, 2018).

        The adverse interest contemplated is not merely a personal interest, but any interest which may prevent the executor or administrator from fully and fairly representing the estate of his testator or intestate. Denning v. Todd, 91 Tenn. 422, 19 S.W. 228, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1892).

        It was error for the probate judge to dismiss a cross bill filed in a partition suit, alleging a debt against the estate of the deceased ancestor, that there was no personalty belonging to the estate, that no administration had been granted or could be procured, and asking for the appointment of an administrator ad litem, in order that the debt might be established, and the land sold to pay the debt. Apple v. Owens, 1 Tenn. Ch. App. 135 (1902).

        Where, after a will was rejected in a will contest, the court allowed attorney's fees to proponent's attorney and this order of allowance was affirmed and the costs taxed against the estate, the reviewing court ordered that an administrator ad litem be appointed, if no general administrator had been appointed, to permit payment of attorney's fees and costs out of the assets of the estate.

        Where validity of will had not been determined, neither legatees nor executor named therein had authority to contest title of widow based on deed allegedly procured by fraud, but under the circumstances court of equity would impound property in dispute and hold it until rights of legatees and executors were determined and administrator ad litem and/or receiver would be appointed by the trial court.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying victims'  petition to intervene in an estate's wrongful death action against a city because the statute specifically gave the victims the right to have an administrator ad litem appointed for the limited purpose of defending against their claim that they were injured by the decedent, nothing in the victims'  petition to intervene or elsewhere in the record suggested that they followed the procedure.

        A motion for the appointment of an administrator ad litem based upon a proper affidavit is not too late, though made after dismissal of the bill, on demurrer, for want of such administrator, but before the decree of dismissal was entered, and during the same term of court; and where the chancellor refuses such application and dismisses the bill, the Supreme Court will reverse and remand the cause for the appointment of such administrator ad litem, and for amended and supplemental bill, and further proceedings.

        The practice of presenting the matter for the appointment of an administrator ad litem by the affidavit of any person interested therein is a proper one to make known to the court the facts upon which such appointment is sought. Denning v. Todd, 91 Tenn. 422, 19 S.W. 228, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1892); Newman v. Schwerin, 61 F. 865, 1894 U.S. App. LEXIS 2250 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1894).

        Bill in chancery which alleged that bank was acting as administrator of estate involved and another estate and also alleged that it was acting as liquidator of a business formerly operated by the two deceased persons and that it should investigate and determine the respective interests of the two deceased persons in the business being liquidated but that it had failed and refused to do so and therefore prayed for appointment of an administrator ad litem of estate involved was in essence a proceeding for removal of bank as administrator which was within exclusive jurisdiction of probate court and was not a proceeding authorizing chancellor to appoint administrator ad litem. Fox v. Commerce Union Bank, 186 Tenn. 181, 209 S.W.2d 1, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 534 (1948).

        Since an administrator ad litem is appointed for a special and limited purpose, it may precede the appointment of a general administrator and the two administrations may subsist together. On the same principle, the special administration may occur after the general administration has been completed. Estate of Russell v. Snow, 829 S.W.2d 136, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 234 (Tenn. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a decedent died the survival statute paused the statute of limitations, and because no personal representative was appointed during the six month period following his death, the statute of limitations recommenced; because the statute of limitations period ran before a driver and her husband filed their action against the administrator ad litem, the statute of limitations barred their personal injury claims, and the administrator's motion to dismiss was properly granted. Putnam v. Leach, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 22 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 23, 2018).

        The appointment of an administrator ad litem, although it recites that it appears that there is no administrator or executor, cannot be sustained, when brought up for review by appeal from the final decree, in the absence of allegation and evidence in the record to support such recital, though such appointment might be good upon collateral attack.

        It is not a good defense to a direct proceeding instituted for the purpose of revoking and vacating the grant of administration, made after the time limited, that the party seeking this relief procured the grant of such administration of which he complains, or assented thereto, for there is want of power to make the grant, and this cannot be waived by any act of the parties.

        Chancery may accept resignation and appoint administrator as successor to a resigned administrator, where it has cognizance of the settlement of an estate which an administrator represents, and whose resignation has been made and accepted. Meredith v. First Nat'l Bank, 127 Tenn. 68, 152 S.W. 1038, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1913).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The administration is an entire thing, and when granted to several, and one dies, resigns, or is removed, the entire authority remains with the survivors or the remaining representative or representatives, and the appointment of an administrator de bonis non in such case is void. Lewis' Ex'rs v. Brooks, 14 Tenn. 167, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1834); Fitzgerald v. Standish, 102 Tenn. 383, 52 S.W. 294, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the death of an administrator or executor, no interest in the personal property and assets left unadministered is transmissible to his own personal representative; but the entire interest in all such property as remains unadministered, in specie, or capable of being identified as the specific property of the estate represented by him, passes to the administrator de bonis non of the original testator or intestate. Schackelford v. Runyan, 26 Tenn. 141, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1846); Smith v. Pearce, 32 Tenn. 127, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1852); Stott v. Alexander, 34 Tenn. 650, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1855); Cheek v. Wheatley, 35 Tenn. 484, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1856); Thomas v. Stanley, 36 Tenn. 411, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the death of the administrator of a deceased debtor, the remedy of his creditors to reach and subject the unadministered property and assets is against the administrator de bonis non of the deceased debtor, and not against the administrator of the deceased administrator, although such property and assets are in his possession. Jones v. Jones, 27 Tenn. 705, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no statute providing for the appointment of successors to administrators who may die before they have closed their administration. Minor v. Webb, 48 Tenn. 395, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1870).

       <p>
        An administrator de bonis non is clothed with the full powers and subject to all the duties of the first administrator. Schackelford v. Runyan, 26 Tenn. 141, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1846); Smith v. Pearce, 32 Tenn. 127, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrator de bonis non was not estopped from recovering slave owned by deceased where law prohibited sale though prior administrator did not object to sale under an execution issued against a third party. Bell v. Speight, 30 Tenn. 451, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1850).
       </p>
       <p>
        The administrator de bonis non may maintain an action of debt upon a judgment recovered in the name of the former executor or administrator. Smith v. Pearce, 32 Tenn. 127, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrator de bonis non was estopped from recovering slave owned jointly by deceased and another though sale was prohibited by law where prior administrator was paid estate's share in the slave. Cheek v. Wheatley, 35 Tenn. 484, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notes payable to former administrator may be sued on, either by such administrator de bonis non, or by the personal representative of such former administrator. Abingdon v. Tyler, 46 Tenn. 502, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1869); Wood v. Tomlin, 92 Tenn. 514, 22 S.W. 206, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1893); Clark v. Pence, 111 Tenn. 20, 76 S.W. 885, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the administrator has sued upon a note, made payable to himself as administrator, for a debt due the estate, such suit may be revived, either in the name of the administrator de bonis non, or in the name of his own administrator, especially where the latter alone applies for a revivor, and it does not appear there is an administrator de bonis non. The recovery in either case shall be subject to all proper accounts between the two estates. Wood v. Tomlin, 92 Tenn. 514, 22 S.W. 206, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1893); Clark v. Pence, 111 Tenn. 20, 76 S.W. 885, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        The administrator may, with or without suit, collect notes, payable to his intestate as administrator of another estate, for debts owing to such estate, and having collected such notes, his sureties are liable for his failure to account therefor, notwithstanding the fact that his intestate left no estate whatever of his own for administration; and they cannot escape such liability, upon the ground that such notes could have been collected by the administrator de bonis non of the estate of the first decedent. Clark v. Pence, 111 Tenn. 20, 76 S.W. 885, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1903).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The administrator de bonis non is not responsible for the maladministration or waste of his predecessor, and, therefore, cannot, at law, call him to account for such waste. Stott v. Alexander, 34 Tenn. 650, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1855); Cheek v. Wheatley, 35 Tenn. 484, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1856); Thomas v. Stanley, 36 Tenn. 411, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        The administrator de bonis non cannot maintain an action of trover against the representative of the former administrator for money of the intestate's estate collected by him, unless such money can be specifically identified. Stott v. Alexander, 34 Tenn. 650, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1855); Thomas v. Stanley, 36 Tenn. 411, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the administrator de bonis non demands notes payable to former administrator, and sues in chancery to obtain possession and control thereof, the personal representative of the former administrator is entitled to be reimbursed for moneys expended or to be expended by him in payment of fees to the attorneys employed to conduct actions on such notes conducted by him. Abingdon v. Tyler, 46 Tenn. 502, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        An administrator de bonis non may maintain a bill in chancery to call his predecessor in administration and sureties or his personal representative to account. Whitaker v. Whitaker, 80 Tenn. 393, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 187 (1883).

        Probate court's decision to deny the individual's request to resign was well within its discretion based upon his stated rationale and the status of the estate; at worst, the individual's action was a subversive attempt to position the estate to further waste judicial resources by initiating new lawsuits challenging the validity of a trust, which the estate was barred from doing, and the individual's justification for resigning did not compel the probate court accept the resignation. In re Estate of Goza, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 19, 2014).

        The administrator with the will annexed succeeds to all the powers conferred by the will upon the executor as executor, though not to such as are vested in him as a personal trust to be executed by him as testamentary trustee, and not as executor. Armstrong v. Park's Devisees, 28 Tenn. 195, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1848); Harrison v. Henderson, 54 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1872); Green v. Davidson, 63 Tenn. 488, 1874 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a will authorized an executor to execute a trust but did not name him as trustee, and executor failed to serve, an administrator with the will annexed could not execute the trust, but he could be appointed as a trustee to execute the trust. Howell v. Stroud, 1 Tenn. App. 301, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 49 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Where the will directs the testator's lands to be sold, without naming a donee of the power of sale, such power is, by implication, devolved upon the executors nominated in the will, if they be charged with the distribution of the funds. Lockart v. Northington, 33 Tenn. 318, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1853); Parker v. Sparkman, 2 Shan. 544 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the power of sale of land vested in executors is coupled with an interest, or a trust is created, the survivors are fully authorized to execute the power originally vested in all of the executors, and a sale and conveyance, made by the survivors, in the execution of such power, will be valid and effective to pass the title of the property to the purchaser, but a mere naked power not coupled with any interest or trust will not so survive, nor can it be executed by the survivors. Belote v. White, 39 Tenn. 703, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 305 (1859); Fitzgerald v. Standish, 102 Tenn. 383, 52 S.W. 294, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1899); Bedford v. Bedford, 110 Tenn. 204, 75 S.W. 1017, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the testator directs his land to be sold by his nominated executors for the purpose of creating funds for distribution among certain legatees, and the intention to make the conversion is clear and certain, the land will be treated as personalty, to the extent of its value, in the hands of the administrators with the will annexed, who may, in such case, sell the land as the executors could have done, had they qualified and remained in office. Green v. Davidson, 63 Tenn. 488, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 295 (1874); Wheless v. Wheless, 92 Tenn. 293, 21 S.W. 595, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1893); Wayne v. Fouts, 108 Tenn. 145, 65 S.W. 471, 1901 Tenn.

        Where the will does not provide for an executor, the statute does not apply, and a sale made by an administrator in such case is void. Where such will contains a direction for the sale of land, it can only be made through the chancery court, and the will does not authorize such administrator to treat the land as personalty, under the doctrine of equitable conversion, and as such sell it.

         Where the appointed administrator has entered upon the administration without giving bond, acted as administrator for several years, marshalled the assets, discharged the debts of the estate, and settled with some of the distributees, he will be permitted, in order to avoid confusion and useless litigation, to give bond, and continue in office, in preference to another person applying for a grant of letters, especially where such appointed but unbonded administrator was the nominee of the nearest of kin to the intestate, and by one degree nearer than the new applicant.

         Chancery will not interfere with the execution of a testamentary trust by the testamentary trustee, and require him to give bond, where he was excused from giving bond in the will unless some danger from misconduct or incapacity of the trustee be shown, or at least apprehended, with good cause; and the property will not be taken from the trustee's custody, unless a breach of trust, or a tendency thereto, is shown. The trustee is not required to be worth as much as the value of the trust property or fund to excuse him from giving bond where so excused by the will. Bowling v. Scales, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 63 (1874); Kerr v. White, 68 Tenn. 161, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1877); Vaccaro v. Cicalla, 89 Tenn. 63, 14 S.W. 43, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         While poverty is no ground to deprive a testamentary trustee of the trust thrown upon him by a testator who excused him from giving bond with full knowledge of his condition, the fact that such trustee is a man of limited means, and has, since the death of the testator, embarked in a large and hazardous business, is sufficient to authorize the appointment of a receiver until the hearing of the case on the merits. Bowling v. Scales, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 63 (1874).

         The appointment of an administrator with the will annexed, without notice to the executor (now personal representative) named in the will, and without his formal renunciation, is not void, so as to hold him responsible as executor (now personal representative) in his own wrong, but is good until revoked, and is merely voidable at the instance of the nominated executor (now personal representative) who may, within proper time, come forward, and, by formal petition, ask that the order of such appointment be set aside, whereupon the court may revoke such appointment, and allow the nominated executor (now personal representative) to qualify. Baldwin v. Buford, 12 Tenn. 16, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1833); Franklin v. Franklin, 91 Tenn. 119, 18 S.W. 61, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1892).

         Where the widow of a decedent was appointed administratrix on the theory that decedent died intestate, but it later appeared that decedent died testate, leaving a holographic will, and the widow joined in a petition for appointment of her son as administrator with the will annexed, it was not reversible error for the court to appoint the son administrator with the will annexed prior to removal of the widow as administratrix.

          The chancery court does not have general jurisdiction concurrent with probate court for appointment of administrators but can only appoint administrators in the exceptional cases cited in this section. Evans v. Evans, 42 Tenn. 143, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1865); Barry v. Frayser, 57 Tenn. 206, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 416 (1872); Bruce v. Bruce, 58 Tenn. 760, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 331 (1872); Branner v. Branner, 69 Tenn. 101, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1878); Shown v. McMackin, 77 Tenn. 601, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 109, 42 Am. Rep. 680 (1882); Meredith v. First Nat'l Bank, 127 Tenn. 68, 152 S.W. 1038, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1913).
         </p>
         <p>
          The appointment of an administrator is not invalidated by reason of the fact that there are no personal effects to be administered, and such administrator may represent the estate in any litigation, in which the estate is required to be represented by an administrator. Barry v. Frayser, 57 Tenn. 206, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 416 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where, pending an application by a bill for the appointment of an administrator of a decedent's estate by the chancery court, filed by a creditor against the heirs and distributees, one of the defendants is secretly appointed and qualified as administrator of the estate by the probate court, the complainant cannot impeach the regularity and validity of such appointment, because he had no notice of it. York v. Parker, 3 Shan. 342 (1875).

          Where the estate of a decedent is partly in one county and partly in another county of this state, the chancery court of either county has jurisdiction to grant administration. Rankin v. Anderson, 67 Tenn. 240, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1874).
         </p>
         <p>
          Allegation in petition that deceased owned real estate in district at time of his death was sufficient to give chancery court jurisdiction even though petition did not allege that deceased was a resident of the district at the time of his death.

         <p>
          A bill for the appointment of an administrator for a decedent's estate, prematurely filed, should be dismissed, upon demurrer; but, where the chancellor overruled the demurrer, and sustained the bill, and a long and expensive litigation was the consequence, the cause will, except as to the costs, be disposed of as though it were rightfully before the appellate court. Evans v. Evans, 42 Tenn. 143, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1865).
         </p>
         <p>
          When filed before the expiration of six months from decedent's death, the bill is premature and subject to demurrer. Evans v. Evans, 42 Tenn. 143, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1865); Bruce v. Bruce, 58 Tenn. 760, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 331 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where a bill in equity alleges death of intestate more than six months before its filing, and that no one could be found to administer, and that rents that accrued to the estate were due from certain defendants, and “it may fairly be inferred” from allegations that the intestate was a resident of the county of suit, and that the defendants so owing the estate resided therein, a case for an appointment of an administrator is made, when tested by a demurrer. Hall v. Calvert, 46 S.W. 1120 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1897).

          While the chancery court may grant administration upon the estate of a person who has been absent from his domicile or last place of residence in this state for the period of seven years, upon a presumption of his death, yet the court should be cautious in acting upon such presumption alone, and should, as a general rule, require diligent inquiry at the place where the party was last heard from; but where a person when last heard from expressed a possible intention of returning home in a year or two (a reasonable time), and has not been heard from for over a quarter of a century, it may be presumed as a fact that he died at the end of seven years from the time when so last heard from, and without issue, where he was then unmarried. Shown v. McMackin, 77 Tenn. 601, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 109, 42 Am. Rep. 680 (1882).

          Administration can be granted by the chancery court only on the application of a creditor or the next of kin. A widow is not next of kin, and is not empowered as widow to file a bill. Especially is this so where there is no personal estate for her to be interested in; but it is intimated that, if there was any personal estate in which she was interested as distributee, the right to file the bill might be given by a liberal construction of the statute. If the widow is a creditor, she may, in that character, maintain the bill for the appointment of an administrator. Bruce v. Bruce, 58 Tenn. 760, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 331 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          A bill may be filed by the personal representative of one of the next of kin against another of the next of kin having assets of the estate of the deceased in his hands, to have an administrator appointed, and for the collection of the fund.

         <p>
          The bill must allege that no person can be procured to administer upon the estate, agreeably to the laws in force, or an allegation of equivalent import must be made. Evans v. Evans, 42 Tenn. 143, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1865).
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill must allege that “no person will apply or can be procured to administer,” and an allegation that complainant “knows of no person that will apply or can be procured to administer” is insufficient, and does not make the case provided for by statute, especially where the complainant is a nonresident. Bruce v. Bruce, 58 Tenn. 760, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 331 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          If the bill alleges that the decedent's “estate, goods, chattels, or effects” were at the time of his death in certain counties of the chancery district, the allegation will be sufficient to give the chancery court of that district jurisdiction to appoint the administrator, without alleging the residence of the decedent to have been there at his death. Rankin v. Anderson, 67 Tenn. 240, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1874).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where the bill alleged that the decedent had been dead more than six months, that no one could be found to administer on her estate, and that there were rents due her estate which accrued in her lifetime from the defendants, a sufficient case is made out for the appointment of an administrator. Hall v. Calvert, 46 S.W. 1120 (Tenn. Ch. App. 1897).
         </p>
         <p>
          A statement in a creditors bill against the estate of a deceased that, “No one has ever applied for letters of administration, and complainant has on this week made an effort to get four or five different people to qualify as administrator, but was unsuccessful,” was sufficient to authorize the chancery court to appoint an administrator. Grace v. Johnson, 25 Tenn. App. 355, 157 S.W.2d 848, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 116 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).

          It is not indispensable that the bill shall, on its face, state that it is filed on behalf of all the creditors of the intestate. The bill, when filed by any creditor, by force of the statute, is filed on behalf of all other creditors. Baker & Paul v. Huddleston, 62 Tenn. 1, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 124 (1873).

          An administrator so appointed is not a mere administrator pendente lite, but a general administrator of the estate, liable to suit, and whose appointment sets in motion the statutes of limitation in favor of the estate.

          Where it does not appear to the chancellor in what, if anything, the personal property of the decedent consists, nor what the value thereof is, so as to determine the amount of the bond, the chancellor's order to the clerk and master to take the individual bond of the administrator for $1,000 leaving further bond, with sureties, to be given thereafter, if there should be any property or effects belonging to the estate, does not invalidate the appointment, especially upon collateral attack, as by the appeal of a surety on a replevy bond given in the suit.

           The probate court is a court of general jurisdiction, and not of a limited or special jurisdiction, as regards the appointment of administrators and the administration of the estates of decedents; and proceedings are entitled to the protection of those rules and presumptions that obtain in favor of the judgment of courts of general jurisdiction. Varnell v. Loague, 77 Tenn. 158, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1882); State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886); Eller v. Richardson, 89 Tenn. 575, 15 S.W. 650, 1890 Tenn.

          <p>
           The probate court exercises the precise jurisdiction in granting letters of administration to public administrators that it does in granting letters or appointing administrators in ordinary cases. The public administrator derives his right to administer any particular estate from his appointment, and the issuance of the letters of administration to him is in the same way as to any other administrator. State v. Anderson, 84 Tenn. 321, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1886).

           This statute indicates a legislative intent that the parties interested in the estate of an intestate should have six months within which to apply for administration in the usual way, and that the public administrator should have no right to demand letters until the expiration of that time. The grant of letters of administration to the public administrator within the six months is not void, but the same may, upon the application of the interested parties within the six months, be revoked by the probate court.

        Where a widow elected against her husband's will and filed a petition for year's support, exempt property, elective share, and homestead, although the widow was entitled to year's support, that support was not chargeable against the real property of the estate; thus, she was entitled to no further compensation under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-101" target="_self">30-2-101</a></cite>.

        Because a husband established that he was the surviving spouse of the decedent, he was entitled to an award of an elective-share and to receive the exempt property; equitable estoppel is not an available defense to a surviving spouse's claim for elective-share and exempt property. In re Estate of Meek, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 325 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 4, 2014), appeal denied, Estate of Meek v. Estate of Meek, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 822 (Tenn. Sept. 19, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a surviving spouse's claims for exempt property and a year's support was appropriate because the surviving spouse's notice of dissent could only have been construed as the surviving spouse's election to take against the decedent's will or, in other words, to seek an elective share. However, because the surviving spouse withdrew the surviving spouse's claim for an elective share, the surviving spouse no longer qualified as a surviving spouse electing against a will.

        In addition to the right to homestead, an elective share under title 31, chapter 4, and exempt property, the surviving spouse of an intestate, or a surviving spouse who elects to take against a decedent's will, is entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for such surviving spouse's maintenance during the period of one (1) year after the death of the spouse, according to the surviving spouse's previous standard of living, taking into account the condition of the estate of the deceased spouse. The court may consider the totality of the circumstances in fixing the allowance authorized by this section, including assets that may have passed to the spouse outside probate.

       <li id="t30c02s30-2-102ol1b">
        The allowance so ordered shall be made payable to the surviving spouse, unless the court finds that it would be just and equitable to make a division of it between the unmarried minor children. If there is no surviving spouse, the allowance shall be made to the unmarried minor children.

       <li id="t30c02s30-2-102ol1c">
        The court may authorize the surviving spouse to receive any personal property of the estate in lieu of all or part of the money allowance authorized by this section, and in any case where the court makes an allowance in money, the surviving spouse shall be entitled to select and receive any personal property of the estate, of a value not exceeding the allowance in money, which shall be in lieu of and which value shall be credited against the allowance.
       </li>
       <li id="t30c02s30-2-102ol1d">
        The allowance authorized by this law is the absolute property of the surviving spouse for these uses and shall be exempt from all claims and shall not be taken into the account of the administration of the estate of the intestate or seized upon any precept or execution.

        If the allowance set by the court as provided in this section is not satisfactory to the surviving spouse electing against the decedent's will, the surviving spouse of an intestate decedent, the unmarried minor children of an intestate decedent or the personal representative, then appeal may be made to the appropriate court in accordance with § 30-2-609. Proceedings on appeal shall be de novo without the intervention of a jury except when demand for a jury is made in accordance with Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 38; provided, that in jurisdictions where probate matters originate in a court whose judge is also a chancellor, the appeal shall be made as otherwise provided by law; and provided further, that in cases heard in a probate court whose judge is required to have the same qualifications as prescribed for circuit judges, the appeal shall also be made as otherwise provided by law.

         Statutes giving chancery court jurisdiction concurrent with county court (now probate court) do not in express terms include jurisdiction to set aside homestead, but same may be said for section defining jurisdiction of county court (now probate court); however, both courts have jurisdiction from ancient times and practice has been both in county (now probate) and chancery courts to appoint commissioners to set aside homestead.

        <p>
         The homestead is only a mere claim until its assignment, and until then it is not an estate subject to conveyance by the widow; but after assignment, either by operation of law when the lands are worth not exceeding the allowed value, or otherwise where they are worth more, the homestead becomes a life estate subject to be sold by the widow. Nelson v. Theus, 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 87 (1915).

        <p>
         Where the husband dies the owner of land worth less than the allowed value, a formal assignment of the property as homestead for the widow is not necessary to vest in her the life estate in such property, because, in such case, the property is “unerringly designated by the law” as the homestead of the decedent's widow. Flatt v. Mack Stadler Co., 84 Tenn. 371, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1886); Briscoe v. Vaughn, 103 Tenn. 308, 52 S.W. 1068, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1899); Delk v.

         In the settlement of the husband's estate, the widow is not required to file any pleading asking that the homestead be set apart to her. It may be applied for verbally or in writing. Archer v. Archer, 3 Tenn. App. 623, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).

         Where land is sold under a mortgage, the widow may be reimbursed out of the personalty of the insolvent estate of her husband, even where foreclosure of mortgage was before the administrator had sufficient right to protect her rights, and there was no waiver by reason of the fact that she did not assert her rights until after foreclosure.

        <p>
         When the homestead is assigned to particular realty, as by metes and bounds, it becomes in the widow a full and absolute life estate in the land, embraced with every right of use or sale that attaches to any other life estate, with the exception that permanent removal from the state works a forfeiture and abandonment of it. Carey v. Carey, 163 Tenn. 486, 43 S.W.2d 498, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 138 (1931).
        </p>
        <p>
         The general rule is that homestead either assigned or unassigned is abandoned by the removal and becoming a resident of another state whether done by the husband or his widow; however, when a widow's homestead has been assigned to her it is not lost when she removes to another state when she retains control of the premises by leasing or renting them to a tenant.

         Upon the suggestion of insolvency of an estate, the probate court has jurisdiction to set apart the homestead; and such assignment cannot be attacked in chancery except for matter necessary to impeach a decree; and the transfer of a proceeding in an insolvent administration from the probate court to the chancery court will not be permitted solely for the purpose of attacking such assignment. Having the jurisdiction to settle insolvent estates, the probate court, as an incident thereto, has the power to set apart homestead in order to ascertain what remains to be sold for debts, without the encumbrance of the homestead. Rhea v. Meridith, 74 Tenn. 605, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 302 (1880); Steele v. Maness, 83 Tenn. 141, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1885); Galyon v. Gilmore, 93 Tenn. 671, 28 S.W. 301, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1894).

         The probate court has no jurisdiction, in a suit brought alone for the assignment of homestead, to assign to a debtor the homestead reserved by him in general terms in a general assignment made for creditors; especially where the homestead land is encumbered with liens, against which the homestead must be protected, or where it is necessary to reinvest $1,000 (now $5,000) of the proceeds in other land for a homestead. The chancery court alone has jurisdiction. Galyon v. Gilmore, 93 Tenn. 671, 28 S.W. 301, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1894).

         While the presumption is always in favor of the legality and regularity of the action of a judicial tribunal, the requirements of the statute make it essential that the order appointing the commissioners should affirmatively show that they have the qualifications prescribed by this statute, namely, that they are “freeholders or householders of the county, unconnected by affinity or consanguinity with those interested in the estate of the deceased”; and the order should specify the surveyor, deputy surveyor, or other competent person to act with them as surveyor and commissioner.

         It would be more regular for the report of the commissioners to recite and show that the homestead set apart is worth the allowed value, but this is not absolutely necessary, and the failure to do so is not fatal. If the report is excepted to for want of such recitation, or showing, it may be shown by proof that the homestead is worth that amount. Christopher v. Christopher, 92 Tenn. 408, 21 S.W. 890, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1893).

          When an executor did not file an inventory of the estate, did not keep a record of the transactions affecting the estate, and did not file a report until after a bill for an accounting was instituted more than seven years after he had qualified as executor he was not entitled to compensation for his services and the fact that there had been litigation concerning insurance proceeds would not excuse him.

          It was error to deny a decedent's child's requests for an inventory and accountings of property in the decedent's estate without finding if the child qualified as a residuary distributee or legatee because (1) T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-301" target="_self">30-2-301</a></cite> required an inventory if demanded by a residuary distributee or legatee, (2) T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-601ol1a4" target="_self">30-2-601(a)(4)</a></cite> only waived an accounting if the will or all residuary distributees waived an accounting, and (3) no copy of the will was in the record, so an appellate court could not find if the child were a residuary distributee or legatee, requiring remand.

          Defendant fulfilled her duty to communicate with the beneficiaries of the estate; although defendant did not want to communicate directly with plaintiffs, she provided information to her attorney, who communicated that information to them. In re Estate of Darken, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 969 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016).
         </p>
         <p>
          Defendant provided plaintiffs with a handwritten list of accounts and could not have provided all of the information plaintiffs demanded because she did not possess nor control access to such information and, in some cases, she did not know the information existed; thus, defendant did not breach her duty by failing to disclose information about the trust assets. In re Estate of Darken, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 969 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016).
         </p>
         <p>
          Defendant was not responsible for failing to provide a copy of the antenuptial agreement with attachments to plaintiffs, and thus plaintiffs failed to establish that defendant breached a duty in this regard; defendant could not have provided a copy because she and the decedent had destroyed their copies and she had no knowledge that the decedent had a copy, plus her attorney allowed plaintiffs'  attorney to examine the files relevant to the estate and concealment was not shown. In re Estate of Darken, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 969 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016).
         </p>
         <p>
          Not including the gold coins on her handwritten list of trust assets did not constitute a breach of duty nor did it establish that defendant intended to conceal the coins from plaintiffs; the list was created in response to plaintiffs'  request for contact information concerning accounts that were assets of the trusts and information about tangible personal property would not have been a relevant response to that request. In re Estate of Darken, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 969 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016).
         </p>
         <p>
          Requirement of making and filing an inventory was waived by the will and thus defendant was not required to file an inventory, and she did not breach a duty by not filing an inventory that included separate line-items of the estate's tangible personal property. In re Estate of Darken, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 969 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016).

The personal representative may employ persons or firms to conduct the sale and shall receive credit for all reasonable expenses of the sale in the final accounting.

          A personal representative who, in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, postpones the sale of bank stocks, will not be held liable for loss to the estate resulting from the subsequent depreciation of such stocks, in consequence of events that he could not foresee or control, and especially is this so where the delay is made at the instance or request of the parties beneficially interested. He is permitted a discretion in fixing the time, place, and terms of selling stocks which is not allowable as to perishable property. Prejudicial haste and dangerous delay are alike to be avoided in sales of stocks. Pearson v. Gillenwaters, 99 Tenn. 446, 42 S.W. 9, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 51, 63 Am. St. Rep. 844, 63 Am.

          Where life tenant leased land in fall of 1898 for the following crop year of 1899 but died on 17th day of March, 1899 the remainderman was entitled to possession at once of land which had been prepared for crops but not planted, since administrator of life tenant had only the right to collect rent up to the date of the death of life tenant.

          In order to work an equitable conversion of land into personalty, so as to subject it to the payment of debts of the decedent as personalty, under an executory contract to convey the land, the contract must be such as the chancery court will, in view of well settled principles, specifically enforce.

          Where son, with knowledge that father intended to place real estate in spendthrift trust for son's benefit, placed mansion and other substantial improvements on land and where, after state had recovered judgment against son, father placed the improved property in such spendthrift trust, state, as judgment creditor regardless of son's actual intent, could subject property to judgment to extent that it was enhanced by contributions of son.

         <p>
          The intent of this act was to afford a simple, inexpensive, and expeditious remedy for administration of estates of decedents; and it should be liberally construed to advance the remedy. Cooper's Estate v. Keathley, 27 Tenn. App. 7, 177 S.W.2d 356, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 124 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
         </p>
         <p>
          This statute dispenses with formal pleadings and strict rules of procedure required in actions commenced in the circuit court. Poole v. First Nat'l Bank, 29 Tenn. App. 327, 196 S.W.2d 563, 1946 Tenn. App. LEXIS 72 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1946).
         </p>
         <p>
          This act was passed to regulate procedure and brings about no change in substantive law. It establishes no new rights and does not deny any right already existing. The administrator is required to give notice to creditors to file their claims with the clerk of the probate court, but there is no change made as to who constitutes “creditors.” Collins v. Ruffner, 185 Tenn. 290, 206 S.W.2d 298, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 332 (1947).
         </p>
         <p>
          Purpose of this and other sections of the general law with reference to the administration of estates is to expedite and simplify such administration. Bowling v. Minton, 193 Tenn. 141, 244 S.W.2d 998, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 338 (1951).
         </p>
         <p>
          The purpose of this and the following sections dealing with claims against the estate is to afford a very simple and expeditious remedy for the administration of estates and in doing so the statute is liberally construed. Needham v. Moore, 200 Tenn. 445, 292 S.W.2d 720, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 428, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1956).
         </p>
         <p>
          This and the following sections all form an orderly system for the probate and distribution of estates and should be construed together so as to make the system consistent in its parts and uniform in its operation. Needham v. Moore, 200 Tenn. 445, 292 S.W.2d 720, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 428, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1956).
         </p>
         <p>
          This and the following sections set up a simple, expeditious and inexpensive remedy for the administration of decedents' estates, and such administration is made a proceeding in rem in which the probate court is given jurisdiction to take charge of the assets of the decedent, whether the estate be solvent or insolvent, and to determine and adjudicate claims against the estate and order their payment. Commerce Union Bank v. Alexander, 44 Tenn. App. 104, 312 S.W.2d 611, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

          Personal representative could be held personally liable for a breach of the duty created by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-306ol1e" target="_self">30-2-306(e)</a></cite> (now T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-306ol1d" target="_self">30-2-306(d)</a></cite>) as to hold otherwise would mean that the legislature intended to provide a personal representative statutory protection for choosing to violate her statutory duty by not notifying known or readily ascertainable creditors with the hope that these creditors would fail to file claims within 12 months of the date of death, likely resulting in more money for the beneficiaries. Burke v. Langdon, 190 S.W.3d 660, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 650 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 13, 2005).

          This act had no application where the executor qualified prior to the date the act became operative. Lockett v. Dermid, 26 Tenn. App. 588, 174 S.W.2d 660, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 122 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
         </p>
         <p>
          Exception by the executrix of the decedents'  estate to a creditor's claim against the decedent's estate was not time-barred because, when the claim was filed against the decedent's estate by the creditor, the clerk of court did not send notice to the executrix of the estate as required by statute. The estate, thus, did not file an exception to the claim until after the time for filing exceptions had run. In re Estate of Hill, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 728 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 14, 2018).

Estate of Jenkins v. Guyton, 912 S.W.2d 134, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 766 (Tenn. 1995).
         </p>
         <p>
          Accurate information about the time period for filing claims must be conveyed in the notice; this can best be achieved by delivering not only a copy of the published or posted notice to creditors, but also a copy of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-307" target="_self">30-2-307</a></cite>, which sets out the various time limits, and a statement of the date of the decedent's death.

          Because creditor received a copy of the published notice which erroneously stated that the creditor had only six months from the date of the first publication of the notice to creditors in which to file a claim, after the six-month period had expired, creditor did not receive “actual notice,” and therefore, had 12 months from the decedent's death to file a claim.

            All claims against the estate arising from a debt of the decedent shall be barred unless filed within the period prescribed in the notice published or posted in accordance with § 30-2-306(b).
           </li>

            Before the date that is twelve (12) months from the decedent's date of death, the court may permit the personal representative to distribute the balance of the estate in accordance with § 30-2-701, make final settlement and enter an order discharging the personal representative. If a creditor files its claim after the estate is closed as permitted in the preceding sentence and before the date that is twelve (12) months from the decedent's date of death, the personal representative shall not be personally liable to the creditor whose recourse will be against the distributees of the estate, each of whom shall share liability on the claim in proportion to the claimant's share of the residue. The burden of proof on any issue as to whether a creditor was known to or reasonably ascertainable by the personal representative, or as to whether actual notice was properly sent in accordance with § 30-2-306, shall be upon the creditor claiming entitlement to actual notice. In such cases, the distributees of the estate shall be personally liable on a pro rata basis if the court finds the claim is proper and the creditor did not receive the appropriate notice.

          The clerk shall file all claims received not later than twelve (12) months from the decedent's date of death. However, filing of claims by the clerk shall not create an inference as to whether the claims are valid or were timely filed. The clerk shall return any claim submitted before the appointment of a personal representative or received more than twelve (12) months from the decedent's date of death.

         <p>
          There is no authority for denying to the legislature the power to fix reasonable limitations upon the filing of claims against the estates of decedents. This is true whether the claims be those of nonresidents or of infants or mental incompetents. Commerce Union Bank v. Gillespie, 178 Tenn. 179, 156 S.W.2d 425, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1940); Pennington v. Pennington, 182 Tenn. 391, 187 S.W.2d 532, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 232 (1945).

         <p>
          All claims and demands against decedent's estate except for taxes and assessments that are not filed with the court (now probate court) within the period provided by this section or on which suit shall not have been brought or revived before the end of statutory period following the date of publication of notice to creditors shall be forever barred from assertion against the executor or any successor administrator with the will annexed, and the personal representative may without liability for the payment, distribute the assets of the estate and close the administration as provided in the statute. Commerce Union Bank v. Gillespie, 178 Tenn. 179, 156 S.W.2d 425, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1940).
         </p>
         <p>
          The effect of the provisions of this section that any written instrument or copy thereof upon which a claim is based is required to be filed, and if due by open account the statement must be itemized is that the claim must prima facie appear to be valid. Miller v. Morelock, 185 Tenn. 466, 206 S.W.2d 427, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 353 (1947).
         </p>
         <p>
          This statutory enactment, limiting the time within which claims against decedents' estates may be filed, has frequently been denominated as a nonclaim or administrative statute for the orderly, expeditious, and exact settlement of such estates. Statutes of the kind are jurisdictional. Alamo Development Corp. v. Thomas, 186 Tenn. 631, 212 S.W.2d 606, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 590 (1948).
         </p>
         <p>
          This section providing for filing of claims is liberally construed. Wilson v. Hafley, 189 Tenn. 598, 226 S.W.2d 308, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 461, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 399 (1949).
         </p>
         <p>
          The statute is designed to afford a simple and somewhat informal method of filing claims and dispenses with formal pleading and is to be liberally construed. In re Estate of Myers, 55 Tenn. App. 195, 397 S.W.2d 831, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 249 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).

          In an action in which a husband's children from a prior marriage contended that a wife's last will was invalid because it breached a contract in which the wife and the husband agreed to make mutual wills, although the husband's children did not file a claim against the wife's estate within the twelve-month period prescribed by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-307ol1a" target="_self">30-2-307(a)</a></cite>, the children's complaint was timely under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.32.html#t32c04s32-4-108" target="_blank">32-4-108</a></cite> because the children decided to file a will contest to challenge the wife's last will and the contest was filed within two years after the entry of the order admitting the challenged will to probate.

          No extraordinary circumstances existed to warrant an extension of the statutory deadline for filing an amended claim since the personal representative filed an exception to the claimant's original claim and the claimant had 33 days to amend his claim; it was not an abuse of discretion to dismiss the amended claim since it was filed one month beyond the deadline under this section.

          Since filing of a claim under this section operates to arrest any statute of limitations where defendant filed a claim within nine (now six) months asking for judgment against insured's estate under subrogation clause of policy in event mortgagee-plaintiffs should prevail alleging intentional burning on part of insured as an issue was present for the court to decide.

          The executor, or other party interested in the estate of decedent, either as creditor, distributee, heir or otherwise, may at any time prior to the end of the 30th day that succeeds the statutory period after publication of notice to the creditors by the executor file exceptions in triplicate to any claim or claims that have been filed with the clerk and the judge may hear and determine all issues.

          Where exception to claim filed in the last month was filed within 30 days after the expiration of the nine (now six) month period from date of notice to creditors, such exception was in time even though it was not filed within 30 days from the date of notice by the clerk of the filing of the claim.

         <p>
          Exception by the executrix of the decedents'  estate to a creditor's claim against the decedent's estate was not time-barred because, when the claim was filed against the decedent's estate by the creditor, the clerk of court did not send notice to the executrix of the estate as required by statute. The estate, thus, did not file an exception to the claim until after the time for filing exceptions had run. In re Estate of Hill, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 728 (Tenn. Ct.

          Representative was not entitled to an extension of time in which to file exceptions to claim where he failed to file exception within period required, but he could file a bill in chancery court for relief on the ground that his failure to file exceptions on time was not due to want of diligence on his part, but to fraud of claimant.

         <p>
          Exception by the executrix of the decedents'  estate to a creditor's claim against the decedent's estate was not time-barred because, when the claim was filed against the decedent's estate by the creditor, the clerk of court did not send notice to the executrix of the estate as required by statute. The estate, thus, did not file an exception to the claim until after the time for filing exceptions had run. In re Estate of Hill, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 728 (Tenn. Ct.

          Where an executor fails to file exceptions to a claim within the time allowed by this section, he may still question the validity of the claim by filing a bill in the chancery court seeking relief upon the ground that his failure to file exceptions in time was due to no want of diligence on his part but was due to the fraud of the claimant.

          Under former T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-314ol1a" target="_self">30-2-314(a)</a></cite> (amended 2015), an exception to a claim must be filed within 30 days after the expiration of four months from the date of the first notice to creditors. Hence, one intending to except to a claim has essentially five months from the first notice. In re Estate of Layton, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 996 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2015).

         <p>
          The filing of a claim in effect amounts to a demand for payment and is the equivalent of the beginning of an action and puts those interested in defending the estate against such claim as well as creditors on notice that they must file exceptions or they will be forever barred from objecting unless there is some fraud or such matter that a court of equity might reach.

          The county court (now probate court) in the exercise of its probate jurisdiction has the power and authority to adjudicate conflicting claims of ownership and right of possession to personal property which is claimed both by the representative of a decedent's estate and by third parties who claim title, not through the decedent and his representative, but from another source.

          In an appeal from a probate court's judgment sustaining a claim against a decedent's estate, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-609ol1b2" target="_self">30-2-609(b)(2)</a></cite> because the probate court's decision did not involve the final settlement of the estate by the personal representative.

          Chancery court erred in setting aside the probate court's order granting conservators'  motion to remove because it was without subject matter jurisdiction to review the probate court's actions or issue any rulings in the case, and thus, all of its orders were void and of no effect; once the conservators decided to file the conservatorship in the property court, any appeals had to be to the court of appeals.

          As a widow's claim against a decedent was not void on its face, and as the estate failed to file an exception to it during the statutory time period, based on the terms of a prenuptial agreement which required any modification thereto to be in writing, the claim had to be considered just.

          When a suit for the construction of a will brought by a prospective beneficiary inures to the benefit of the estate, the attorney for the complainant is entitled to a reasonable fee payable by the estate; however, when the suit is brought for the benefit of the beneficiary, and has as its objective the defeat of the testator's intent, the complainant's attorney has no right to compensation from the estate.

         <p>
          Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an estate's attorney compensation for his services because his services were necessary and beneficial to the estate; all of the lesser beneficiaries were paid their dollar amounts, distributions were made to the main beneficiaries, deeds were drawn to facilitate matters, and the attorney remained in constant contact with the executrix.

          Fee the trial court awarded an executrix did not exceed reasonable limits because the executrix promptly and faithfully discharged her duties, and the services she provided were reasonable, appropriate, and inured to the estate's benefit; throughout the administration of the estate, the executrix's actions were in good faith.

          Trial court did not err in holding that an executor's fees were properly paid by the estate so long as the fees were reasonable and necessary because any assertion that the trial court erred in finding that all of the attorney's fees inured to the benefit of the estate, despite the attorneys also representing the individual parties, was waived; a beneficiary failed to include the appropriate citations in the argument section of her brief.

          Where, although estate was insolvent, there were sufficient funds in estate for payment of federal estate and state inheritance taxes and will provided that such taxes were to be considered a debt against estate and not a charge against any beneficiary, proceeds of deceased husband's life insurance would not be subjected to prorate allocation for such taxes as between the beneficiary children.

           Trial court properly ordered the personal representative (PR) to sell a portion of the decedent's real property sufficient to fund the annuities bequeathed to his daughters, the beneficiaries, because the gifts of the annuities to the beneficiaries were charges on the residuary estate consisting of both the decedent's personal property and real property; no rule of law or public policy contravened the intent of the decedent that the annuities he left to the beneficiaries be funded by his estate, which included his real property; the probate court had jurisdiction to sell the decedent's real property; and the PR could use the decedent's real property to satisfy the obligations of the decedent when the personal property was insufficient.

           The reason and policy of the statute are stated to be: (1) To prevent accumulation of costs by numerous separate suits at law against the personal representative and separate scire facias proceedings to subject the lands; (2) to prevent the consumption of the real estate by a portion only of the creditors to the entire deprivation of the others; (3) to prevent sacrifice of the estate in satisfying the first few judgments that might be obtained against the personal representative and against the land; (4) to authorize the court, which had an account of all the debts before it, and an exact knowledge of the character, description, and probable value of the estate, to take the land into the custody of the court, and direct its sale for the benefit of all, under such circumstances as would insure the best price.

           These statutory provisions include all such debts as, in the course of the investigation originated by the bill, may be shown to exist, whether mentioned in the bill or not. Dulles v.

           A bill filed in chancery by a creditor of a decedent's estate to compel the collection of a debt due the estate, and secured by a vendor's lien on land sold by the deceased, upon the ground that such personal asset is endangered by the negligent or collusive conduct of the administrator in refusing to collect the debt, is not a bill under this section.

           Where it is sought to have surplus proceeds of mortgage foreclosure sale applied to payment of sum due foreign administrator as compensation and his attorney's fees, lands in this state may not be charged therefor, and in attempting to enforce such charges the local personal representative is a necessary party.

           Jurisdiction of circuit court is statutory and limited and requirements of statute must be complied with. Whitmore v. Johnson's Heirs, 29 Tenn. 610, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1850); Kindell v.

          </p>
          <p>
           The circuit court has all the jurisdiction of the chancery court to subject the lands of decedents to the payment of their debts; and, like the chancery court, it may decree sales and make all such incidental orders and decrees as the circumstances and equities of the particular case may require, so as to carry into effect the object of the law, and to protect and secure the interests of the creditors, personal representatives, widows, heirs, and purchasers. Moore's Adm'rs v. Widow & Heirs, 30 Tenn. 512, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1851).
          </p>
          <p>
           The jurisdiction of the probate court must be confined to the legal title. The statute was not designed to affect valid prior liens, mortgages, or securities acquired by a creditor upon the property of the deceased in his lifetime, and, therefore, where he was seized of an equitable interest, resort must be had to a court of equity. Parchman v. Charlton, 41 Tenn. 381, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 79 (1860).

          <p>
           The probate court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit and chancery courts to sell lands to pay the debts of decedents, where the personal assets are insufficient for that purpose, whether the insolvency of the estate has been formally suggested or not.

          </p>
          <p>
           Independent of statute, the court of chancery has inherent jurisdiction to subject realty of a decedent, and may do so where all necessary persons are parties and the necessity is alleged and shown. Allen v. Shanks, 90 Tenn. 359, 16 S.W. 715, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1891); Waddell v. Waddell, 42 S.W. 46, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 29 (1897).

           The statute does not make it compulsory upon the personal representative to file the bill, but authorizes him to do so if he thinks proper, and if he neglects or refuses to do so, any bona fide creditor, whose debt remains unpaid, may file it for the attainment of the identical objects which would have been obtained had the representative filed it. Dulles v. Read, 14 Tenn. 52, 14 Tenn. 53, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1834); Vance v. Sanders, 67 Tenn. 294, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 376 (1874).

           Any bona fide creditor may, for himself and all other creditors, file a bill against the personal representative and the heirs for an account of the administration, and to sell a sufficiency of the lands descended to pay the residue of debts, after exhausting the personal assets, or ascertaining their insufficiency, and to enjoin other creditors from further proceeding at law by scire facias, or otherwise, the object being to settle up the estate by one bill or suit only.

           A surety, against whom and his cosurety a judgment has been rendered for the whole debt, is a bona fide creditor, and is entitled to file a bill against the personal representative and heirs of the deceased cosurety for contribution, and, upon an allegation of the exhaustion of personal assets, for a sale of the lands of such decedent for the payment of the recovery and debts.

           The heirs or devisees, as the case may be, must be made parties to suits under this statute in order that they may have an opportunity to contest the proper administration and exhaustion of the personal assets, and the justness of the claims, and that the title may be divested out of them and vested in the purchaser, in the event of a sale. If the heirs or devisees are not made parties, they cannot be affected by any decree made in the suit, and the sale will be a nullity as to them as well as to the purchaser, and utterly void and inoperative. Estes v. Johnson, 29 Tenn. 223, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1849); Shields v. Alsup, 73 Tenn. 508, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1880); Taylor v. McGill, 74 Tenn. 294, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 251 (1880); Davis v.

           To a bill filed by the personal representative, the creditors are not necessary parties, though they may be parties, but if they are named in the bill, and their debts are set out and conceded, they become quasi parties so as to prevent a subsequent bar under the statute of limitations.

          <p>
           The heirs and distributees, devisees and legatees, when impleaded by creditors in an action against the personal representative, may interpose for the protection of their rights, the statutes of limitations, within which suit must be brought against the personal representative by creditors, although these statutes were originally intended for the benefit of the personal representative only. Woods v. Woods, 99 Tenn. 50, 41 S.W. 345, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1897).
          </p>
          <p>
           Statutes of limitations in favor of estates of decedents operate against creditors of insolvent estates after suggestion and advertisement of insolvency as well as against creditors of solvent estates. Woods v. Woods, 99 Tenn. 50, 41 S.W. 345, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1897).
          </p>
          <p>
           The running of the statutes of limitations in favor of the estates of decedents is not prevented in favor of the creditor by the fact that there was a will which creditor had a right to bring into court for construction, where the will was promptly probated, and he was entitled to nothing thereunder. Woods v. Woods, 99 Tenn. 50, 41 S.W. 345, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1897).

           The proceeds of land sold are in the custody of the court, and not of the personal representative, and it is not his duty, but that of the creditor, after his claim has been allowed, to ask the court for an order directing the clerk to pay him his debt or its pro rata out of the proceeds. Dulles v. Read, 14 Tenn. 52, 14 Tenn. 53, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1834); Gillespie v. Darwin, 53 Tenn. 21, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 312 (1871); Moses v. Moses, 1 Shan. 414 (1875).
          </p>
          <p>
           The administrator of a decedent is the mere representative of the personalty, and a fund arising from the sale of land in his suit for its sale to pay debts of the decedent's estate must be retained and disbursed in the court where the bill is filed, and not paid over to him to be administered, even upon a special bond to secure the fund. Moses v. Moses, 1 Shan. 414 (1875).

           An administrator may become purchaser at a sale of realty made by a master in chancery, even though the bill was filed by him, but the court, will narrowly scrutinize his good faith upon any charge of fraud. Cooley v. Cooley's Heirs, 37 S.W. 1028, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 51 (1896).

          <p>
           The excess of the proceeds of the sale of land above what is necessary to pay the ancestor's debts for which it was sold, like the land, belongs to the heirs or devisees, and not to the personal representative of the ancestor. Read v. Bostick, 25 Tenn. 321, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1845); Moses v. Moses, 1 Shan. 414 (1875).
          </p>
          <p>
           Where, upon the adjudged exhaustion of the personal assets, land was sold for the payment of debts of a decedent and a surplus was realized, such surplus may be impounded and applied to the payment of a judgment against the administrator of the deceased debtor in favor of the complainant creditor who was not a party to the suit for the sale of the land to pay debts, but such impounding suit is not one for the sale of land by a creditor under this section.

          <p>
           Though the executor is authorized by the will to sell lands, for the payment of debts, the remedy of the testator's creditors is not confined to a decree of the chancery court compelling the executor to execute the power, but, if for any reason, this power of sale be not executed, there can hardly be any doubt that either the circuit or chancery court would proceed directly to sell the land for the payment of debts, following the direction of the will as to what lands should be first applied to the debts.

          <p>
           Irregularities, so gross as to be reversible error upon a direct proceeding by appeal, may not invalidate the decree, or render the sale made under it void in a collateral attack. A decree showing the jurisdictional facts is not void on collateral attack, though reversible upon appeal, for its failure to show on its face, by recital, the necessity to sell all the lands sold, what debts and their amount remaining due, and simply shows that “there were just debts due and owing from the estate.” Griffith v. Philips, 77 Tenn. 417, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1882).
          </p>
          <p>
           Mere irregularities, though gross, do not render a sale void, but only voidable. Griffith v. Philips, 77 Tenn. 417, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1882).
          </p>
          <p>
           After a long acquiescence but without actual possession by either party, and resales of the land, a most liberal rule should be applied, consistent with settled principles, in favor of the validity of proceedings for the sale of lands. Griffith v. Philips, 77 Tenn. 417, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1882).
          </p>
          <p>
           A decree of the sale of lands of a decedent to pay his debts, reciting that the estate of the deceased “is largely indebted, that its indebtedness amounts to … dollars, or more, and that the personal assets amounts only to the sum of about … dollars,” does not assume the facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction to sell the land, and is void on its face, and purchasers will acquire no title under it. Young v. Young, 80 Tenn. 335, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 177 (1883).
          </p>
          <p>
           Every presumption is in favor of the regularity of its proceedings in cases in circuit court for sale of land. Ridgely v. Bennett, 81 Tenn. 210, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1884).
          </p>
          <p>
           In a bill filed to sell lands, it is more regular and proper to set out each specific debt, and to whom due, but if the amount is aggregated in the bill, and the amount established by the proof largely exceeds the personal assets, and such aggregate amount is so reported by the master, and there is no exception to the report, the cause will not be reversed on this account. Doherty v. Choate, 84 Tenn. 192, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 136 (1885); Allen v. Shanks, 90 Tenn. 359, 16 S.W. 715, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1891); Puckett v. Wynns, 132 Tenn. 513, 178 S.W. 1184, 1915 Tenn.

          </p>
          <p>
           Where administrator's petition for sale of real estate alleged the facts required by the statute and the decree stated them to have been made out to the satisfaction of the court and assumed them as its basis and the grounds of the sale, and the court otherwise had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter, one cannot in a collateral proceeding attacking the sale look beyond the pleading and decree to see if the proceedings were formal and the decree based upon the proper evidence.

           Chancery court cannot decree a sale of the land in another state, but, having acquired jurisdiction of the person, it may coerce the party holding the land in trust to make a conveyance of the entire tract to the personal representative, to be sold by him under the order of the court, for the benefit of the creditors and distributees of the estate.

           Where the ascertained personal assets of the estate are insufficient to pay his debts, and are not in a condition to be applied, the court, treating them good and available, may decree a sale of sufficient land to discharge the excess of indebtedness over the amount of such available assets, without delaying the cause until the assets can be actually applied. Doherty v. Choate, 84 Tenn. 192, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 136 (1885).

           Under a bill of conformity to settle up the trusts of an administration or a bill for the sale of lands under this section or an insolvent bill, there can be no decree for sale of land without showing necessity and in case of a bill of conformity the amount of personal assets and the amount of the debts due must first be ascertained, so that it can be clearly seen that the personal estate (the primary fund for this purpose) is insufficient for the purpose and how much land should be sold to meet the deficiency. Miller v. Taylor, 2 Shan. 461 (1877).

          <p>
           To authorize a decree for a sale before actual application of personalty to the extent it is available in exoneration of the lands, it should be made clearly to appear that such personalty will be insufficient. Maxwell v. Smith, 86 Tenn. 539, 8 S.W. 340, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1888).
          </p>
          <p>
           Sale of land will be decreed where valid debts in excess of the amount of personal assets are shown, and the administrator has not wasted the assets of the estate, and it is not necessary in such case to await the actual application of the personal assets before ordering a sale of the land. Pearson v. Gillenwaters, 99 Tenn. 446, 42 S.W. 9, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 51, 63 Am. St. Rep. 844, 63 Am. St. Rep. 844 (1897).

          <p>
           The personal assets of an estate have been “exhausted in the payment of debts,” so far as to justify a sale of land to pay debts, where the amount actually realized from the personal estate is insufficient to pay all the debts, though the personal assets were of sufficient value at one time for that purpose, if they had been then disposed of, but have since depreciated in value, without fault of the administrator, and thereby became insufficient.

           The realty of a decedent may be subjected to the satisfaction of his debts where the goods and chattels of the estate which came to the hands of the personal representative, or the notes taken for same upon a sale thereof, and good when received, are lost, without such fault on his part as would render him and his sureties liable, for, if the administrator is not chargeable, the creditors of the estate are not chargeable therewith, in favor of the heir or devisee.

           The personal estate has not been “exhausted in the payment of bona fide debts,” where the administrator or executor has paid the personal funds to the distributees or legatees, and the lands of the decedent are, in such cases, exonerated to the extent of such distribution. The creditors can resort to the personal liability of the personal representative and distributees and legatees who may be compelled to refund for the payment of debts. Where the distributees or legatees are also the heirs or devisees, the lands of the decedent so descended or devised are likewise exonerated to the extent of such distribution. The lands descended or devised may be subjected to the satisfaction of the personal liability of the distributees or legatees for the repayment of such funds where they are also the heirs or devisees, but the lands must be subjected as the lands of the heirs or devisees, and not as the lands of the decedent.

           Where the suit is under this statute, and the decree of sale asserts that the exhaustion or insufficiency of the personal estate and the existence of bona fide debts remaining unpaid appeared to the court, the recitals of the decree of sale are conclusive, and not subject to collateral attack, though there be no report by the clerk.

           A judgment against the personal representative is prima facie evidence of such indebtedness in a suit, under this statute or the insolvent statute, to sell lands of the decedent to pay his debts, and the burden is on the heirs or devisees to show that it is not a just claim, and that the estate is not liable.

          <p>
           Neither a judgment by default upon motion against a personal representative, nor his refusal to plead “fully administered,” especially if such course was resorted to for the purpose of defeating the creditor, is such an admission of personal assets as will estop the judgment creditor from showing the truth, that there were no such assets, in a proceeding to subject the realty to the payment of the debt.

           A decree for the sale of land unappealed from and unreversed, and adjudging that the personalty had been exhausted in the payment of debts and special legacies, is conclusive of that fact in another case between the same parties to sell other lands for the payment of a debt subsequently arising, although it appears that the personalty was not exhausted in the payment of special legacies, but in the payment of general legacies, and that the former decree erroneously adjudged the general legacies to be special legacies.

           Where lands are attached in the lifetime of the ancestor, and he dies before judgment, there must be a revivor against the personal representative, and an exhaustion of personal assets against the heir, before an order of sale can be had against the land. Green v. Shaver, 22 Tenn. 139, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1842); Stockard v. Pinkard, 25 Tenn. 119, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1845); Perkins' Heirs v. Norvell, 25 Tenn. 151, 1845 Tenn.

           Where no one will administer on the estate of a decedent, any person who has commenced a suit against him in his lifetime may have a scire facias against his heirs or devisees, and may prosecute the suit to judgment and execution against the real estate of the deceased ancestor descended or devised.

           The scire facias against the heirs should call upon the heirs to show cause why plaintiff should not proceed against the heirs, in the action which was pending against the ancestor at the time of his death, to the trial of the issues, and to verdict and judgment in respect of the real estate which descended to them. If it should also call upon the heirs to show cause why the suit should not be revived against them, it would be untechnical, but not fatally erroneous. Smith v. Stump's Heirs, 7 Tenn. 278, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1823).

          </h4>
          <p>
           It is not a good plea in abatement to such scire facias that the defendants had not, at the time of the issuing of the writ of scire facias, nor at any time before or since, any lands by descent and as heirs of the decedent.

          <p>
           It is no defense to a scire facias to revive a judgment against the personal representative of the deceased judgment debtor, that the amount of the judgment was allowed as a claim against the estate, and was ordered to be paid pro rata, without a revivor, in a chancery suit instituted by the personal representative, after his suggestion of the insolvency of the estate, for the purpose of administering the estate as an insolvent estate. The judgment creditor is entitled to a new judgment against the personal representative, and if such judgment is not rendered in such administration suit, so as to merge the old judgment, he is legally entitled to a revivor of his judgment, especially where there was no injunction against the revivor of the old judgment. McIntosh v. Paul, 74 Tenn. 45, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1880).

          <p>
           The record should show by suggestion of record and proof that no one would administer, in order to authorize the issuance of the scire facias against the heirs, but such defect cannot be taken advantage of by a collateral attack, and at most, it could but amount to an error that might be ground for reversal, but would not render the revivor void. Edgington v. Jamison, 70 Tenn. 569, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 198 (1879); Preston v. Golde, 80 Tenn. 267, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (1883); McDonald v. Nashville, 114 Tenn. 540, 86 S.W. 317, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1904).
          </p>
          <p>
           The fact that there is an administrator, or that one could have been procured, may, perhaps, be waived by the heirs, where they answer a scire facias reciting that no one will administer or answer one issued under an order based on the suggestion that no one would administer, but giving them notice that the revivor is sought against them to obtain judgment against them on account of lands descended or personalty received from their ancestor, where they fail to show cause why such action by revivor should not be had against them, by pleading that there was an administrator, or a designated person willing to administer. Preston v. Golde, 80 Tenn. 267, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (1883).

          <p>
           The proper judgment upon scire facias is that the plaintiff have judgment and execution against the lands descended generally, without specifying them, for the debt and costs to be levied on them. Smith v. Stump's Heirs, 7 Tenn. 278, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1823); Butterworth v. Brown's Heirs, 15 Tenn. 467, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1835).
          </p>
          <p>
           The judgment should not be against the heirs personally, but, if so rendered against them, it is not absolutely void, for such error does not affect the validity of the judgment as against the lands descended, and, upon appeal, the judgment may be corrected. Edgington v. Jamison, 70 Tenn. 569, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 198 (1879).

          Where, in a suit against an executor or administrator, the plea of “fully administered,” “no assets,” or “not sufficient assets to satisfy the plaintiff's demand,” is found in favor of an executor or administrator, the plaintiff may proceed to ascertainment of the plaintiff's demand, and entry of judgment; but before taking out execution against the real estate of the deceased debtor, the heirs or devisees of the deceased debtor shall be summoned by scire facias to show cause why execution should not be issued against the real estate for the amount of the judgment, or so much of it as there may not be personal assets to discharge.

           The statute providing for scire facias against the heir or devisee, to subject the ancestor's lands, whether descended or devised, to the payment of the ancestor's debts, is in derogation of the common-law rights of heirs and devisees, and must be strictly construed, and the remedy thereby given must be strictly pursued.

          <p>
           In a direct proceeding by the creditor to reach the land by scire facias upon the judgment recovered against the administrator, the law is that the heir may make the objection that the defense of fully administered was not put in by the administrator in the suits in which the judgments were recovered, and that the land descended cannot be subjected without a finding in favor of the administrator upon such an issue; however the same reason does not apply to a proceeding under §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c05s30-5-121" target="_self">30-5-121</a></cite> — <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c05s30-5-124ol1repealed" target="_self">30-5-124 (repealed)</a></cite> which is in the nature of a suit in equity and requires an account of the personal assets to be taken before the rendition of any decree against the land.

           The plea of “fully administered,” “no assets,” or “not sufficient assets” may be tried in the forum where the action is pending, and if in the circuit court, it may be tried before a jury, if properly demanded.

          </h4>
          <p>
           Where the plaintiff negatives the plea of “fully administered,” and procures a judgment against the administrator for his debt, he is not entitled to a scire facias against the heir, for where the plea of “fully administered” is found against the personal representative, the lands of the decedent cannot be subjected, by scire facias against heirs or devisees, to the payment of his debts. Peck v. Heirs of Wheaton, 8 Tenn. 353, 1828 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1828); Anderson v. Lessee of Clark's Heirs, 32 Tenn. 156, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1852); Henry v. Mills, 69 Tenn. 144, 1878 Tenn.

           A general finding by verdict against the plea of fully administered, without ascertaining the balance of assets unadministered, is unquestionably bad, for no judgment against the administrator for any particular sum can be entered on such finding.

           The scire facias must either name the heirs or devisees, or the sheriff must serve it personally upon them, and make known the names in his return, otherwise, the judgment and the sale of the land made thereunder will be void.

          </p>
          <p>
           The scire facias must be based upon a domestic judgment against the personal representative, for the statute applies exclusively to domestic judgments. Gilman v. Tisdale's Heirs, 9 Tenn. 285, 1830 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1830); Brown v. Wright, 12 Tenn. 56, 12 Tenn. 57, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1833).

          </p>
          <p>
           The issuance of scire facias to subject lands is a judicial act and must be awarded by the court upon a suggestion made of record that real estate has descended to the heirs. Hillman Bros. v. Hickerson, 40 Tenn. 575, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 172 (1859); Bank of West Tenn. v. Marr, 81 Tenn. 108, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1884); Simons v. Page, 96 Tenn. 718, 36 S.W. 843, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1896).
          </p>
          <p>
           The scire facias should require the heirs or devisees to show cause why execution should not be issued against the real estate of the ancestor, and not to show cause why the judgment against the ancestor should not be revived against them, for there is no authority for a simple revivor of a judgment against the heirs or devisees. Frierson v. Heirs of Harris, 45 Tenn. 146, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1867).
          </p>
          <p>
           Before scirce facias can be resorted to, the personal representative must be first called on, by suit, to pay debts due from his testator or intestate with the question of whether he has the assets with which to pay to be determined, ordinarily, by the result of the suit against him, and, perhaps, by the return of nulla bona to execution and the heir or devisee has the right to demand that all this shall be done before he is vexed.

          <p>
           The law will not permit the establishment of a claim against the personal representative, by judgment, even to affect the inheritance of the heir, without a further proceeding by scire facias against the heir himself. Stephenson v. Yandle, 4 Tenn. 109, 1816 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1816).

           A lien against the land descended or devised is created by the suing out of process by scire facias against the heir or devisee to subject the land to the payment of the ancestor's debts, and the mere judgment against the personal representative is not a lien on the land of the ancestor descended or devised. Porter's Lessee v. Cocke, 7 Tenn. 29, 7 Tenn. 30, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1823); Peck v. Heirs of Wheaton, 8 Tenn. 353, 1828 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1828).

           To the scire facias on the judgment against the deceased debtor, the heir or devisee can make no defense that the debtor might have made to the rendition of the judgment, but he may show that the personalty has not been exhausted, while to a scire facias on a judgment against the personal representative, the heir or devisee may plead any plea, or make any defense that the ancestor might have pleaded or relied upon, as well as show that the personalty has not been exhausted, or that the same has been wasted.

           Where execution issued against chattels, is returned “no personal property found,” and levied on real estate of the deceased, and upon return of the execution into court, scire facias is ordered against his heirs, such proceedings are void, because there is no authority in law for the sheriff's levying the execution on realty descended or devised, upon his simple return of no personalty to be found, and thereafter bringing the heirs before the court by scire facias to show cause why the land should not be ordered to be sold.

           An action at law will not lie against a personal representative upon a judgment rendered against his intestate or testator as the personal representative of the estate of another decedent, suggesting a devastavit, because founded on a tort which, by the common law, died with the person. Griffith v. Beasly, 18 Tenn. 434, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1837); Stott v. Alexander, 34 Tenn. 650, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1855); Cheek v. Wheatley, 35 Tenn. 484, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1856).
          </p>
          <p>
           A personal judgment against an executor or administrator, upon a bill taken for confessed, without any allegation of a devastavit, is erroneous, and it will be corrected on a bill of review. Dance v. McGregor, 24 Tenn. 428, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1844).
          </p>
          <p>
           Scire facias to charge an executor or administrator personally must be based upon a suggestion of record that he has been guilty of a devastavit, or the suggestion of record must state such facts as, of themselves, make out a case of devastavit. Simons v. Page, 96 Tenn. 718, 36 S.W. 843, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1896).

           A personal representative may rely upon the plea of fully administered in proceedings to charge him personally, where he had no opportunity of pleading in the original proceeding, as in case of judgment by motion, without notice or appearance. Williams v. Greer's Adm'rs, 5 Tenn. 235, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1817); Wray v. Williams, 10 Tenn. 302, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1829); Cox v. Cox, 10 Tenn. 305, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1829); Henry v. Mills, 69 Tenn. 144, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1878).
          </p>
          <p>
           Where the recovery against a personal representative is by decree in chancery, upon pleadings raising no issue or contest as to whether he had wasted the assets, he may rely upon the defense of the insufficiency or want of personal assets, in any subsequent proceeding to charge him personally. Wray v. Williams, 10 Tenn. 302, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1829); Cox v. Cox, 10 Tenn. 305, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1829).
          </p>
          <p>
           Judgment against a personal representative operates as a conclusive admission that he has assets of the estate to satisfy it, and, in a subsequent proceeding to render him personally liable on such judgment, he will not be allowed to defend upon the ground that there were no assets, or that he had fully administered them, when he had opportunity to do so, and made no such plea in the former suit, or the plea, if made, was found against him. Blount & Williams v. Hopson, 9 Tenn. 399, 1830 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1830); Griffith v. Beasly, 18 Tenn. 434, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1837); White v. Archbill, 34 Tenn. 588, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1855); Simons v. Page, 96 Tenn. 718, 36 S.W. 843, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1896).
          </p>
          <p>
           Where the personal representative is sued upon the former judgment against him suggesting a devastavit, he may defend by showing that there were goods of the decedent which might have been levied on, notwithstanding the sheriff's return of no goods of the decedent. The charge of devastavit is prerequisite. Griffith v. Beasly, 18 Tenn. 434, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1837).
          </p>
          <p>
           After judgment by default against an administrator upon a scire facias based on a suggestion of devastavit to make him personally liable, the suggestion of insolvency can be interposed to defeat such personal liability, if interposed before such liability has been fixed by judgment in the scire facias proceeding upon the suggestion of devastavit, though it be after the original judgment against the administrator for the debt. Mosier v. Zimmerman, 24 Tenn. 62, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1844); Ford v. Woltering, 57 Tenn. 203, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 415 (1872); Griffin v. Fowlkes, 2 Shan. 151 (1876).
          </p>
          <p>
           It is not a good plea to a scire facias on a judgment against an administrator suggesting a devastavit, that he was discharged from the office of administrator and his successor appointed before the judgment was rendered, nor is it a good plea that he did not waste the assets for these defenses, if true, should have been made to the original action, and if the plaintiff, instead of demurring to the second plea, takes issue upon it, and the issue is found in his favor, he is entitled to judgment. Cude v. Spence, 26 Tenn. 278, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 125 (1846).
          </p>
          <p>
           The personal representative may defend against a subsequent suit to make him personally liable, by showing that the assets of the estate were destroyed under circumstances which exonerate him from personal liability.

           The law allows the collateral issue between the personal representative and the heirs or devisees, for the reason that they should not, without a hearing, be stripped of their inheritance or devise. Neither the personal representative nor the creditor represents the heirs or devisees in the creditor's action against the personal representative, so as to bind them on the lands descended or devised.

           The heir or devisee may plead that the executor or administrator has not fully administered, or that he has or had assets. The same idea is preserved in the statute contained in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-406" target="_self">30-2-406</a></cite>. Johnston v. Dew, 6 Tenn. 224, 1818 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1818).

           This section regards the personal assets and the conduct of the personal representative in administering them and the fact that it authorizes the heir or devisee to contest the plea of fully administered does not confine his defense to that alone, nor exclude any defense that goes to the merits of the claim or debt which has been established by judgment against the personal representative.

           If the heirs or devisees make the defense to the scire facias that the executor or administrator has assets, or has wasted the same, it is a matter to be tried between the heirs or devisees and the personal representative; and if found against the personal representative, it will defeat the scire facias, and subject the personal representative, in his own proper estate, to the payment of the debt; but if such defense is not made, the personal representative need not appear in the proceeding by scire facias and the judgment sustaining his plea of fully administered or insufficient assets in the former proceeding will be taken as admitted.

            No notice of insolvency was filed; the state bureau raised only the likelihood that if it had filed a timely claim, a notice of insolvency would be necessary—that might be so. After failing to file a timely claim, however, a party would not be free to take advantage of the insolvency that that claim might have brought about; because the trial court held that the state bureau did not file its claim in time, the procedural trigger for treating the estate as insolvent — the filing of the notice of insolvency — never occurred, therefore even if T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-501ol1a" target="_self">30-2-501(a)</a></cite> created an exception to the ordinary statutes of limitations, that exception did not apply.

             1. Scire Facias.
            </span>
           </h4>
           <p>
            Scire facias may issue, citing heirs or devisees to show cause why the plaintiff shall not have execution of the lands descended. In case no one will administer, a pending suit may be revived against the heirs or devisees, and judgment and execution may be had against the land of the decedent, descended or devised. Frierson v. Heirs of Harris, 45 Tenn. 146, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1867); Bank of West Tenn. v. Marr, 81 Tenn. 108, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1884).
           </p>
           <p>
            An original scire facias will not lie in the circuit court to revive against the personal representative a judgment against the decedent rendered by general sessions judge; but upon appeal to the circuit court in the revivor proceeding, the scire facias may be amended in that court. Bryant v. Smith, 47 Tenn. 113, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1869); Whitworth v. Thompson, 76 Tenn. 480, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1881).
           </p>
           <p>
            A judgment rendered against a decedent in his lifetime, may be revived against his personal representative, upon writ of scire facias; and where the execution issued on such revived judgment is returned nulla bona, the plaintiff therein is entitled to proceed under the statute. Simons v. Page, 96 Tenn. 718, 36 S.W. 843, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1896).

            </span>
           </h4>
           <p>
            While the suggestion of record and the allegation of the scire facias that the personal representative named had wasted and converted to his own use the assets of his intestate or testate, may be good, yet such suggestion and allegation of a mere conversion to his own is not equivalent to a charge of devastavit, and is not sufficient. Caleb Cope & Co. v. McFarland, 39 Tenn. 543, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 271 (1859); Jackson ex rel. Alexander v. Crank, 1 Shan. 599 (1876).

             3. —Defenses.
            </span>
           </h4>
           <p>
            The defense may be made by plea to scire facias. Newnan v. Stuart, 6 Tenn. 78, 1818 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1818); Keller v. Myers, 73 Tenn. 305, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1880).
           </p>
           <p>
            To a scire facias against a personal representative to render him individually liable on a judgment against him in his representative character, it is a good plea, even at law, that the judgment was rendered as a compromise judgment upon an agreement to look to the real estate of the intestate. Newnan v. Stuart, 6 Tenn. 78, 1818 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1818); Keller v. Myers, 73 Tenn. 305, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1880).
           </p>
           <p>
            Failure of an administrator to plead “no assets” or “fully administered” in answer to scire facias to revive judgments rendered against his intestate precludes him from subsequently making such defense. The question is res judicata. Simons v. Page, 96 Tenn. 718, 36 S.W. 843, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1896).
           </p>
           <p>
            The administrator waives the question of jurisdiction by appearing and pleading “no assets” and “fully administered” to writs of scire facias seeking execution against him personally on judgments rendered against him in his representative capacity with execution returned nulla bona. Simons v. Page, 96 Tenn. 718, 36 S.W. 843, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1896).

           </h4>
           <p>
            A personal representative's waiver of scire facias to revive judgment may authorize the issuance of execution against the personal representative, but not against the deceased debtor. Gwin v. Latimer, 12 Tenn. 22, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1833).

           </h4>
           <p>
            A scire facias to revive a judgment does not warrant a new judgment, but simply a judgment awarding execution of the original judgment. Bryant v. Smith, 47 Tenn. 113, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1869); McIntosh v. Paul, 74 Tenn. 45, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1880); Whitworth v. Thompson, 76 Tenn. 480, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1881); Bank of West Tenn. v. Marr, 81 Tenn. 108, 1884 Tenn.

            Amendments. The 2016 amendment substituted “sworn waivers, or statements under penalty of perjury, excusing” for “waivers excusing” in (a)(4)(B); substituted “has, for estates where the death occurred prior to January 1, 2016, filed with the court a final receipt from the department of revenue unless waived pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c08s67-8-409ol19" target="_blank">67-8-409(9)</a></cite>,” for “has filed with the clerk of the court exercising probate jurisdiction the final receipt and release from the department of revenue evidencing payment of all state inheritance and/or estate tax due from the estate, unless waived pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c08s67-8-409ol19" target="_blank">67-8-409(9)</a></cite>,” in (b)(1); and added “Except as provided in subdivision (a)(4)(B),” at the beginning of (d).

             The probate court has no jurisdiction to confirm or reject a proposed settlement of the personal representative, until the clerk has taken and stated the account with him, has passed upon his vouchers, and has signed and filed his report of the settlement, for the court has no original jurisdiction to act upon the personal representative's ex parte statement of the account made by himself, though embodied in the form of a petition. Cothran, 57 Tenn. 119, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (1872).
            </p>
            <p>
             The question whether the probate court has jurisdiction to pass the accounts of testamentary trustees in cases other than upon the death, resignation, or removal of an old trustee, and the appointment of a new one is reserved, because it is not necessary to consider the question in a case where the evidence satisfies the court that the allowance of compensation to such trustees, made by the county court settlement, was proper. Leach v. Cowan, 125 Tenn. 182, 140 S.W. 1070, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1911).

             In a suit by a legatee in probate court against an administrator with the will annexed, to open the settlement of the estate, and to compel the administrator to pay to complainant a legacy which the administrator, by misrepresentations to the legatee, caused the legatee to renounce, the county court had no jurisdiction, in view of these sections and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-701" target="_self">30-2-701</a></cite>. In re Hodge's Estate, 20 Tenn. App. 411, 99 S.W.2d 561, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 31 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

            <p>
             Propriety of fees and compensation in an estate cannot be determined by a bill in chancery but it is a matter solely for probate court upon settlement by administrator. Fox v. Commerce Union Bank, 186 Tenn. 181, 209 S.W.2d 1, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 534 (1948).

             Administrator was not required to reveal what assets came into its hands from the business of the deceased in a bill in chancery since that was for the probate court to pass upon. Fox v. Commerce Union Bank, 186 Tenn. 181, 209 S.W.2d 1, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 534 (1948).

             When the personal representative makes a full settlement of the estate, by which is ascertained the amount going to distributees or legatees, it is a final settlement in such sense that the statute of limitation of ten years begins to run against the distributees or legatees from its date, as to all matters embraced therein, but not as to amounts subsequently received by the personal representative, no account of which was made in such settlement.

            <p>
             This section contemplates that the executor or administrator shall voluntarily render his account, and it is his duty to do so after the expiration of the time or times fixed by the statute; and this duty must be discharged within a reasonable time thereafter. Willeford v. Watson, 59 Tenn. 476, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1873).

             It is the duty of the administrator to make and state his accounts and to distribute the balance as provided by law or by the will of the deceased, after 18 months. State use of Burrow v. Cothron, 21 Tenn. App. 519, 113 S.W.2d 81, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 53 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).

             This provision is simply an economical one, applicable to ordinary cases, and was never intended to be applied in cases where, by the terms of the will, or on account of the condition of the assets or liabilities, it is impossible to close the administration within the time prescribed.

            <p>
             The reasonable time after the lapse of the time fixed by statute for rendering account within which the representative must so render account is such additional time as is necessarily consumed in carrying out the proceedings for settling the accounts. Willeford v. Watson, 59 Tenn. 476, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1873).

             The accounting requirements exist not only for the beneficiaries' benefit but also for the benefit of the estate's creditors, the taxing authorities, and the courts. They are intended to ensure the correct administration and speedy settlement of estates and to remove the temptation and opportunity for fraud and embezzlement. McFarlin v.

             It was error to deny a decedent's child's requests for an inventory and accountings of property in the decedent's estate without finding if the child qualified as a residuary distributee or legatee because (1) T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-301" target="_self">30-2-301</a></cite> required an inventory if demanded by a residuary distributee or legatee, (2) T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-601ol1a4" target="_self">30-2-601(a)(4)</a></cite> only waived an accounting if the will or all residuary distributees waived an accounting, and (3) no copy of the will was in the record, so an appellate court could not find if the child were a residuary distributee or legatee, requiring remand.

             The probate court possesses the necessary authority and has the requisite facilities to have a full and complete accounting with an administrator, making all proper charges against him, and allowing him credit for all items to which he is entitled. In re Love's Estate, 176 Tenn. 696, 145 S.W.2d 778, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1940).

             A headstone, tombstone, or other suitable memorial is a proper part of the decedent's funeral expenses. Fite v. Beasley, 80 Tenn. 328, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 176 (1883). See also Gooch v. Beasley, 137 Tenn. 407, 193 S.W. 132, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1917).

            <p>
             Where the personal representative of an insolvent estate has paid, out of his own means, on the funeral expenses, an amount in excess of the personal assets, the same will be refunded to him out of the proceeds of the realty, in preference to the debts that are not specific liens thereon. Loftis v. Loftis, 94 Tenn. 232, 28 S.W. 1091, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1895).

            <p>
             The manner of burial and erection of a monument for deceased is a matter largely within the discretion of the personal representative so long as the amount expended is reasonable, but it is subject to the approval of the court. Gooch v. Beasley, 137 Tenn. 407, 193 S.W. 132, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1917).
            </p>
            <p>
             The absence of any direction in the will of the deceased, on the subject of a monument over his grave, does not impair the executor's right to make the expenditure, if the amount be reasonable. Gooch v. Beasley, 137 Tenn. 407, 193 S.W. 132, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1917); Wiles Bros. & Co. v. Wynne, 139 Tenn. 397, 201 S.W. 515, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1918).
            </p>
            <p>
             In the absence of any direction in the will, an executor or administrator has the right to use his discretion in incurring funeral expenses, but the amount must be reasonable. Wiles Bros. & Co. v. Wynne, 139 Tenn. 397, 201 S.W. 515, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1918).

             An expenditure of $1,332 for the funeral of a person who had been an imbecile and an inmate of an asylum for years prior to his death, and whose estate was worth less than $10,000, was an unwarranted extravagance. Wiles Bros. & Co. v. Wynne, 139 Tenn. 397, 201 S.W. 515, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1918).

             The disbursements, for which the personal representative is entitled to credit, are such unavoidable payments of money as are necessary for the collection and disposal of the estate for the benefit of the parties interested. Funeral charges, charges for the probate of the will or granting letters of administration, for recording inventories and accounts of sale, for orders of sales, for the expense of suits legally brought for the benefit of the estate, or of defending suits brought against the representative, and the like charges and disbursements, and debts against the estate legally paid, and reasonable compensation for the representative's services, are allowable as credits in his settlements.

             The executor cannot be allowed credit for money paid for the improvident expenditures of a legatee while at college, though such payment was made from a conviction that it was best for the young man, and was done to save him from disgrace, but he must account for the same, with interest. Jones v. Ward, 18 Tenn. 160, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1836); Dial v. Wood, 68 Tenn. 296, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1878).

             The personal representative is not liable for foreign assets, even though he has taken steps to secure them; but where such steps were taken in good faith, he will be allowed credit for expenses incurred thereby, especially if done at the instance of parties in interest. Bowman v. Carr, 73 Tenn. 571, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 185 (1880).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where the executors borrowed money for the estate and applied it to that purpose, they are entitled to legal interest from the time of such application; but they are not entitled to a credit for the usury they paid on such borrowed money, because they borrowed the money without authority. Allen v. Shanks, 90 Tenn. 359, 16 S.W. 715, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1891).

             A decedent's lands in Tennessee cannot be charged the expense of administering his estate in another state. Fidelity Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Wall, 167 Tenn. 207, 68 S.W.2d 108, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1934).

             The personal representative of an estate is entitled to reasonable compensation. In re Estate of Roark, 829 S.W.2d 688, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 867 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, — S.W.2d —, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 228 (Tenn. Mar. 9, 1992).

             Trial courts have the discretion, in the first instance, to determine whether the requested fees and expenses are reasonable. In re Estate of Wallace, 829 S.W.2d 696, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
            </p>
            <p>
             This section does not prescribe an inflexible rule for determining reasonableness of fees and expenses. This determination must be made in light of all the relevant circumstances, including the extent of the executor's responsibilities, the nature of the services rendered, the promptness and adequacy of the services, and the value of the benefits conferred. In re Estate of Wallace, 829 S.W.2d 696, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).

             Testamentary trustees are entitled to compensation though there has never been enacted, in this state, any statute giving testamentary trustees compensation. Barney v. Saunders, <cite class="us_code">57 U.S. 535</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">14 L. Ed. 1047</cite>, 1850 U.S. LEXIS 1567 (1854); Coffee v. Ruffin, 44 Tenn. 487, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1867); Danial v. Fain, 73 Tenn. 258, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1880); Vaccaro v. Cicalla, 89 Tenn. 63, 14 S.W. 43, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1890); Read v. Citizens' St. R.R., 110 Tenn. 316, 75 S.W. 1056, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1903); Leach v. Cowan, 125 Tenn. 182, 140 S.W. 1070, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1911).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trustees (including personal representatives) who discharge their duties as such, with promptness and fidelity, are entitled to a liberal compensation, but certainly not otherwise. Coffee v. Ruffin, 44 Tenn. 487, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1867); Leach v. Cowan, 125 Tenn. 182, 140 S.W. 1070, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1911).
            </p>
            <p>
             The statute does not fix or limit the rate of compensation of personal representatives. No inflexible rule as to the compensation, alike applicable to all estates and circumstances, could perhaps be justly prescribed, either by the legislature or the courts. The amount of their compensation should, in each particular case, be determined by the extent of responsibility, the nature of the services rendered, and other causes difficult to limit or define. Much discretion as to such compensation is confided to the probate courts, though their action is subject to review and supervision. Matlock v. Rice, 53 Tenn. 33, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 314 (1871).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where the estate was large and was greatly involved in debt, and the burden and responsibility of the estate was upon one of two executors, such active executor was allowed a compensation of 7½ per cent on the amount collected, while the other less active executor was allowed the same rate of compensation on the amount collected by him, which was not so much in the aggregate. Brown v. Dortch, 59 Tenn. 740, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1874).
            </p>
            <p>
             The amount of compensation is properly settled when the account is taken, and the allowance is made, and it does not, as a matter of law, bear any interest prior to that time. Johnson v. Patterson, 81 Tenn. 626, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1884).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where the personal representative deposited the funds of the estate with his own firm, but otherwise performed his duties well, and the county court allowed him as compensation 10 per cent on his disbursements, the Supreme Court allowed him half of these commissions. Cannon v. Apperson, 82 Tenn. 553, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1885); Gwynne v. Estes, 82 Tenn. 662, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1885).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where, by the will, enlarged discretion is given to the executors, together with the express provision that they shall be liberally compensated, nothing but a gross breach of their duty will cut off their compensation for such services as they have rendered; and where there appears to be no breach of their duty, but, on the contrary, good faith and more than ordinary care in the transaction of the business confided to them, their compensation will not be disallowed on exception upon the ground of unreasonable delay in the settlement of the estate, where the delay was explained and met by the fact of repeated litigations and other complications, that would have prevented a complete settlement, if attempted earlier than was done. Williams v. Williams, 83 Tenn. 438, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1885).
            </p>
            <p>
             Reasonable compensation will be allowed the personal representative and his attorneys for services necessarily rendered in a suit for the sale of lands of a decedent's insolvent estate for the payment of debts, and the same will be paid as preferred claims out of the proceeds of the realty, where there is no personalty, or it has been exhausted. Such compensation should be fixed with reference to the entire estate and services. Loftis v. Loftis, 94 Tenn. 232, 28 S.W. 1091, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1895). But see Porterfield v. Taliaferro, 77 Tenn. 242, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 46 (1882); Loague v. Brennan, 86 Tenn. 634, 9 S.W. 693, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1888).

            <p>
             Executors are entitled to reasonable compensation to be credited upon their settlements. Leach v. Cowan, 125 Tenn. 182, 140 S.W. 1070, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1911).
            </p>
            <p>
             An administrator who is removed after a claim for preference is filed is entitled to a reasonable fee for services rendered prior to removal. In re Estate of Hicks, 510 S.W.2d 263, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 284 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where a will specifies that an executor is to receive a certain amount as compensation, or no compensation, for serving as an executor, he, by accepting the appointment, binds himself to the will's terms. In re Estate of Perlberg, 694 S.W.2d 304, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3254 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
            </p>
            <p>
             Award of $25,000 to the co-executor for his services as co-executor was inappropriate because over four years passed between the testator's death and the filing of a complaint against the co-executor, during which time he accomplished little toward the administration of the estate and the assets remained captive to the co-executor's inattention to his duties. In re Estate of Ladd v. Marks, 247 S.W.3d 628, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 280 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2007), aff'd, In re Estate of Ladd, 247 S.W.3d 628, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 428 (Tenn. Ct.

            </p>
            <p>
             Fee the trial court awarded an executrix did not exceed reasonable limits because the executrix promptly and faithfully discharged her duties, and the services she provided were reasonable, appropriate, and inured to the estate's benefit; throughout the administration of the estate, the executrix's actions were in good faith. In re Estate of Abbott, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 816 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2013).

            <p>
             Haywood County, Tenn., Ch. Ct. R. 19:00(H)'s rule of thumb regarding the fees to be awarded to a personal representative is antithetical to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-606" target="_self">30-2-606</a></cite>'s requirement that the fees be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account more than simply the size of the estate. In re Estate of Young, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 55 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2016).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trial court did not err in holding that an executor's fees were properly paid by the estate so long as the fees were reasonable and necessary because any assertion that the trial court erred in finding that all of the attorney's fees inured to the benefit of the estate, despite the attorneys also representing the individual parties, was waived; a beneficiary failed to include the appropriate citations in the argument section of her brief. In re Estate of Storey, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 121 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 469 (Tenn. July 19, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trial court did not excessive fees to an executor, and thus, did not abuse its discretion in its award of fees and expenses, because the executor submitted multiple petitions and affidavits outlining the services he provided administering the estate; the executor spent many hours over the last eleven years responding to litigation initiated by the beneficiary, and in addition to defending himself in the litigation, the executor also performed his duties as the executor of the estate. In re Estate of Storey, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 121 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 469 (Tenn. July 19, 2018).

            <p>
             Trial court did not err in holding that an executor's fees were properly paid by the estate so long as the fees were reasonable and necessary because the executor completely prevailed against a beneficiary in her claim that the executor breached his fiduciary duty or otherwise acted inappropriately; the trial court specifically found that the beneficiary's actions, rather than the actions of the executor, were the root of the litigation. In re Estate of Storey, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 121 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 469 (Tenn. July 19, 2018).

             Where the personal representative is the surviving partner of the decedent, and no funds came into his hands except the decedent's interest or share in the partnership business, he is entitled to no compensation for his services. Piper v. Smith, 38 Tenn. 93, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 126 (1858); Murray v. Johnson, 38 Tenn. 353, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 189 (Tenn. Dec. 1858); Dodson v. Dodson, 53 Tenn. 110, 1871 Tenn.

             Where the personal representative's accounts are unsatisfactory, his statements are conflicting, and there is much evidence tending to show, but not clearly establishing, that he should be charged with a much larger amount than he was charged with, he is entitled to no compensation for his services.

             Where an executor did not file an inventory of the estate, did not keep a record of the transactions affecting the estate, and did not file a report until after a bill for an accounting was instituted more than seven years after he had qualified as executor, he was not entitled to compensation for his services and the fact that there had been litigation concerning insurance proceeds would not excuse him. State v. Hardison, 26 Tenn. App. 80, 167 S.W.2d 998, 1942 Tenn. App. LEXIS 33 (1942).

             Work of the personal representative (PR) was inadequate and did not add much value to the estate, his actions in remodeling and repairing the decedent's house were outside the scope of his authority, and his handling of the estate's money was questionable; the evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that the PR did not administer the estate in a competent manner, and thus he was not entitled to any further fees.

             Executors have the authority to retain counsel to assist them in administering an estate. When they retain counsel, they are personally liable for the fees until a court determines that the services were required and that the fee was reasonable. If a court approves the fee, the executor may charge it back against the estate as one of the costs of administration under this section. In re Estate of Wallace, 829 S.W.2d 696, 1992 Tenn.

             Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an executor's lawyers fees, and the fees awarded were not excessive, because it specifically considered the factors of Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. Prof. Conduct 8, 1.5 and the gross value of the estate; the executor ultimately prevailed completely in defending against the multiple claims leveled by a beneficiary, his attorneys were well-equipped to handle the matter, and it was necessary to incur the fees due to the beneficiary's litigation strategy.

             Given the voluminous record, the court of appeals found no error where such errors were not specifically detailed in the argument section of a beneficiary's brief, and all issues regarding redundant charges were, therefore, waived; at no point in her argument did the beneficiary cite a single specific instance of a redundant billing, and with regard to the single sentence contention, she failed to cite to the actual itemized billings to show alleged redundancies.

             The executor and testamentary trustee is not entitled to an allowance for counsel fees incurred in a suit unnecessarily and improvidently brought for a construction of the will and for directions as to the administration of the trust. Vaccaro v. Cicalla, 89 Tenn. 63, 14 S.W. 43, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1890).

             A personal representative cannot bind the estate to pay retainer fee to counsel, but only sum for services rendered. Pate v. Maples, 43 S.W. 740, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 93 (1897).

             The executor, saving the estate counsel fees by diligent and efficient legal services rendered to himself as executor, should be allowed greater compensation than that ordinarily allowed an executor or trustee employing other counsel, but should only be compensated as executor. Holding v. Allen, 150 Tenn. 669, 266 S.W. 772, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 36, <cite class="alr">36 A.L.R. 743</cite> (1924).

             An attorney who assists an administrator who is removed after a claim for preference is filed is entitled to reasonable attorney fees for services rendered. In re Estate of Hicks, 510 S.W.2d 263, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 284 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).

            <p>
             In order for attorney's fees to be allowed as an administrative expense, they must be shown to be required, and the services provided must inure to the benefit of the entire estate, as opposed to one or more of the interested parties.

             The executrix of decedent's estate was entitled to attorney's fees in a suit for breach of fiduciary duty where decedent's wife, with a valid power of attorney, withdrew decedent's separate funds from the decedent's checking account and used the funds for the wife's sole benefit. Martin v. Moore, 109 S.W.3d 305, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 47 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 440 (Tenn. May 19, 2003).

             Trial court erred in approving a personal representative's request for attorney's fees, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c02s30-2-606" target="_self">30-2-606</a></cite>, because the fees were all incurred in the process of preparing an agreement not authorized by the will or approved by the court, to pay a claim that was not made, and then defend those actions when challenged; the services rendered were to the benefit of a family trust and did not benefit the estate. In re Estate of Ledford, 419 S.W.3d 269, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 246 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 791 (Tenn. Oct. 16, 2013).

            <p>
             Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an estate's attorney compensation for his services because his services were necessary and beneficial to the estate; all of the lesser beneficiaries were paid their dollar amounts, distributions were made to the main beneficiaries, deeds were drawn to facilitate matters, and the attorney remained in constant contact with the executrix. In re Estate of Abbott, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 816 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2013).
            </p>
            <p>
             Request of the estate's personal representative (PR) for additional attorney's fees for an appeal was properly denied because, even if the initial award of attorney's fees did not include the estimated 40 hours on appeal, there was no proper legal basis to award the PR with further attorney's fees solely from the remaining beneficiary's portion of the estate as the PR knew he intended to appeal and that she intended to leave only his share in the estate from which to seek costs from the appeal, which did not show the utmost good faith that was required from a fiduciary; and the PR did not demonstrate any legal basis to hold the beneficiary individually liable for her attorney's fees. In re Estate of Culp, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 753 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2017).

             Where the decedent's foreign debtor comes temporarily into the jurisdiction of the state of the decedent's domicile, or where he has property there subject to attachment, it is the duty of the executor or administrator of the decedent to sue him in the first case, and to attach his property in the second, and for failure to do so, such executor or administrator would be liable for any loss resulting therefrom. Young v. O'Neal, 35 Tenn. 55, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1855); St. John v. Hodges, 68 Tenn. 334, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1878).

             Where the personal representative suffers a loss of the assets of the estate, accidentally by fire, he should within a reasonable time bring the facts to the knowledge of the parties interested; and, if the facts be not admitted, he should perhaps take immediate steps to obtain credit or allowance for the loss from the court having jurisdiction of the subject-matter; but, at any rate, if he fails to communicate the facts to the interested parties, and only sets up the defense to a bill filed against him for an accounting after the lapse of 12 years from the loss, the burden of proof is upon him, and he must make out the defense by proof establishing the facts clearly and satisfactorily, and with convincing certainty.

            <p>
             A personal representative is not liable for compound interest, except in cases of conversion to his own use, of fraud or gross negligence, or very culpable conduct, or where he has had funds in his hands and probably profited by them, or has failed to make a frank disclosure. Turney v. Williams, 15 Tenn. 172, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1834); Torbet v. McReynolds, 23 Tenn. 215, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1843); Alvis v. Oglesby's Ex'rs, 87 Tenn. 172, 10 S.W. 313, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1889).
            </p>
            <p>
             There are several distinct grounds upon which a personal representative may be charged with interest, as follows: (1) Where he has used the money of the estate for himself, whether to his profit or not; (2) where he has kept the money by him and negligently suffered it to lie idle without a reasonable ground for doing so; (3) where, by long and improper delay in making his settlements, the use of the money by him may be inferred; (4) where he has been negligent in laying out the money for the estate; (5) where he has committed some other misfeasance by acts of negligent or wrongful administration or in the management of the funds by which they were imperiled to the disappointment of the claimants on the assets; (6) where he has actually made interest on the money. However, in specifying or enumerating these grounds, others are not thereby excluded. Turney v. Williams, 15 Tenn. 172, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1834); Jones v. Ward, 18 Tenn. 160, 1836 Tenn.

            <p>
             Where there are no disbursements on which interest should be allowed on the principle of partial payments, and the personal representative is properly chargeable with compound interest, it seems that it would probably be the rule to make the periodical rests for compounding the interest to correspond with the periods required for the settlements, which would be annually after the personal representative's first settlement period of two years from his appointment and qualification. Jones v. Ward, 18 Tenn. 160, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1836); Woods v. Rankin, 49 Tenn. 46, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 187 (1870); Smith v. Thomas, 67 Tenn. 417, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 391 (1874).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where the personal representative has used the money of the estate himself, he will be charged with simple interest thereon, although he has not made a profit equal to simple interest; and if he has made more than simple interest, he will be charged with the whole profits, either by charging him with compound interest, or in such other manner as will best carry out the principle of giving the beneficiaries of the estate all the profits; and in cases of doubt, the beneficiaries may elect. Cannon v. Apperson, 82 Tenn. 553, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1885).
            </p>
            <p>
             Where the personal representative is charged with interest upon the entire sum with which he was chargeable, he should be allowed interest on his disbursements, from the time they were made, on the principle of partial payments.

             While the probate court has no jurisdiction of a petition to require the personal representative to charge himself with a sum with which he had charged himself as administrator of another estate, when considered as an independent action drawing into question the title to property, it has jurisdiction of such petition as a suggestion that the administrator has not returned a complete inventory. Black v. Black, 134 Tenn. 517, 184 S.W. 27, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 175 (1916).
            </p>
            <p>
             The probate court possesses the necessary authority and has the requisite facilities to have a full and complete accounting with an administrator, making all proper charges against him, and allowing him credit for all items to which he is entitled. In re Love's Estate, 176 Tenn. 696, 145 S.W.2d 778, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1940).
            </p>
            <p>
             The probate court or the circuit or chancery court on appeal has jurisdiction to determine whether an administrator should be charged with the particular item on an exception to the inventory and settlement although the administrator insisted the item did not belong to the estate. Teague v. Gooch, 206 Tenn. 291, 333 S.W.2d 1, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 364 (1960).

             The settlement, if formal in detail, and accurate in all its parts, and unexcepted to, and if otherwise unexceptionable, may so far constitute the basis of the clerk and master's report as to authorize the chancellor to direct a decree of sale of land to pay the debts of the estate. Curd v. Bonner, 44 Tenn. 632, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1867); Shields v. Alsup, 73 Tenn. 508, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1880); Bloom v. Cate, 75 Tenn. 471, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1881); Erck v.

             The inventories and settlements of personal representatives, when put upon the records of the probate court, have the verity of judicial records, except that they may be impeached by those interested in the estate as not showing the full measure of the personal representative's liability.

             An ex parte settlement, made without notice, is prima facie correct, even as against interested parties laboring under disabilities. Elrod v. Lancaster, 39 Tenn. 571, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 280 (1859); Shields v. Alsup, 73 Tenn. 508, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1880); Leach v. Cowan, 125 Tenn. 182, 140 S.W. 1070, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1911).

            <p>
             Where it is ordered by the probate court that the personal representative be permitted to resign his office and to pass his accounts as such by a final settlement to be made with the clerk, such order contemplated an account of the receipts and disbursements of such representative, and not for his own individual account as a creditor of the estate, and a statement of his such account, made to the clerk and by the clerk presented to the court and by the court approved or confirmed, was void, for settlements, when made not in pursuance of law or order of court, are not evidence. Harrison v. Henderson, 54 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1872).
            </p>
            <p>
             An uncompleted settlement before the clerk, never presented to the court for confirmation, is not in any aspect even prima facie evidence of its correctness. Harrison v. Henderson, 54 Tenn. 315, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1872).
            </p>
            <p>
             The settlement, though not final, is, so far as it goes, prima facie evidence in favor of the administrator, as where he makes a partial settlement, but subsequently dies without completing the administration by a final settlement. Alvis v. Oglesby's Ex'rs, 87 Tenn. 172, 10 S.W. 313, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1889).

             Where annual accounts are first attacked long after they were made and after the death of both executors and trustees and of all others having any personal, intimate knowledge of the facts, and vouchers for disbursements were, in large part, filed with such reports, they were properly taken as prima facie correct, although the record failed to show affirmatively that due and legal notice was given all parties interested prior to their approval by the court. Lovewell v. Schoolfield, 217 F. 689, 1914 U.S. App. LEXIS 1466 (6th Cir. 1914).

            <p>
             The settlement is conclusive as against the personal representative, and he will not be allowed to falsify it, at least without allegations in his bill minutely and particularly specifying the various erroneous items complained of, and the clearest and most satisfactory proof thereof; especially where the settlement was sworn to, and its correctness was affirmed by a sworn answer, and the personal representative sought relief against such settlement by an amended answer and cross bill. Dodson v. Dodson, 53 Tenn. 110, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 327 (1871); Snodgrass v. Snodgrass, 60 Tenn. 157, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 428 (1873); Smith v. Gooch, 74 Tenn. 536, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (1880); Richardson v. Keel, 77 Tenn. 74, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1882); Montgomery v. Coldwell, 82 Tenn. 29, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 100 (1884).
            </p>
            <p>
             The burden of proof rests upon the complainants to show the incorrectness of the administration settlement surcharged and falsified by their bill; and a decree of reference, directing the master to take the inventory and account of sales as a basis of charges against the administrator, and requiring of him independent proof of the credits allowed in his settlements, thus casting the burden of proof upon the administrator, is erroneous; and, upon reversal of the decree adverse to the administrator, the case will be remanded for the taking of the account upon the proof in the record, and upon the principles determined by the Supreme Court. Alvis v. Oglesby's Ex'rs, 87 Tenn. 172, 10 S.W. 313, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1889).
            </p>
            <p>
             In suit to impeach the final settlement of the defendant-executor, such settlement is prima facie correct, and the burden is on complainant to show by proof the incorrectness of the account she seeks to surcharge and falsify and it can be disturbed only by evidence of a clear and satisfactory nature. Brown v. Jarvis, 22 Tenn. App. 394, 123 S.W.2d 852, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 39 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).

             Where the parties interested are under no disability, and, either in person or by agent, are present and attend during the settlement of the personal representative with the clerk, and have an opportunity to object to any improper credits, with the right to contest the report of settlement and to appeal to the circuit or chancery court, and if, under these circumstances, they agree to the settlement, and receive and receipt for their respective shares in property and money, the settlement is made, in effect, their own, and should have all the conclusive character, force, and effect of a stated account, so as not to be opened without a bill, filed promptly after the discovery of the mistake, to surcharge and falsify it by pointing out and specifying the particular errors against which relief is sought. Burton v. Dickinson, 11 Tenn. 112, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1832); Turney v. Williams, 15 Tenn. 172, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1834); Elrod v. Lancaster, 39 Tenn. 571, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 280 (1859); Shields v.

            </p>
            <p>
             Where the parties do not attend during the settlement, and the settlement is wholly ex parte, it is only prima facie evidence against the interested parties, and it may be questioned, opened, and reviewed by their bill asking for an account generally, without surcharging and falsifying, or specifying and pointing out, in the bill, any particular errors. In such case, the burden of proof rests upon the attacking party, and the settlements are prima facie correct. Where the interested parties are infants and without guardians, or do not attend, by their guardians, the settlements in which they are interested, although notified, they may question such settlements by a bill for a general accounting; but, if they attend by their guardians, they can question such settlements only by a bill to surcharge and falsify the accounts. Turney v. Williams, 15 Tenn. 172, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1834); Elrod v. Lancaster, 39 Tenn. 571, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 280 (1859); Milly v. Harrison, 47 Tenn. 191, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1869); Shields v.

             Settlements, made and confirmed in legal proceedings, are not open to attack by bill to surcharge and falsify the same, not attacking them as decrees. Vaccaro v.

            </p>
            <p>
             Settlements by executors, made in the probate court after notice to all the parties, who were present in the person of their attorney and guardian, are prima facie correct, even as to amount of compensation allowed the executors, and can only be attacked by a bill to surcharge and falsify the accounts; and the evidence to sustain such bill must be clear and satisfactory. Leach v. Cowan, 125 Tenn. 182, 140 S.W. 1070, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1911).

             Where one of the testamentary trustees presented a claim against the trust estate, which, before it was allowed in the probate court settlement, was fully investigated by the other two testamentary trustees, who were adversely affected by its allowance, and all parties in interest and adversely affected thereby were represented, and there was no fraud, and no new evidence was produced, the claim cannot be stricken out of the account, even under a bill to surcharge and falsify.

            <p>
             A voluntary payment of a distributive share or legacy to the clerk of the probate court, without any order or decree of such court requiring the payment, is not a good payment, and is no protection to the personal representative as a defense to a suit to recover such share or legacy. Stewart v. Glenn, 50 Tenn. 581, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1871).
            </p>
            <p>
             The personal representative must, at his peril, pay to the right party as distributee or legatee, or he must have the judgment of a competent court upon the question in a proceeding regularly instituted for that purpose. The probate court has no jurisdiction to determine to whom the personal representative should make payment, and its order of approval of the final settlement containing a statement of the distributees already paid or entitled to payment, with the amount thereof, does not protect the personal representative in his payments accordingly made, if not made to the right party and in the right amount. Carr v. Lowe's Ex'rs, 54 Tenn. 84, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 418 (1871).
            </p>
            <p>
             The probate court was authorized to require an administrator to pay into the office of the clerk the balance found to be due the estate of his intestate, upon his settlement, and on his failure, and the clerk's motion, was authorized to award execution against the administrator and his sureties for the amount of the balance, upon notice given to the administrator alone, without any notice of the motion to the sureties. Patterson v. Tate, 141 Tenn. 607, 213 S.W. 981, 1919 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1919).

             The motion may be made by “the clerk or any distributee,” after the prescribed notice. However, the suit, though it be by petition in the probate court, must make all the distributees parties, because it is required to “be conducted as other equitable actions,” and one distributee cannot sue for his own share alone.

             The order of the court to compel the administrator to pay into the office of the clerk the balance that may be found against him, upon the settlement of his accounts, is not in the form or nature of a judgment in favor of any particular individuals, but an order to pay the money into the clerk's office for the benefit of those entitled, where the proper parties must appear and satisfy the court of their right to the fund. Bayne v. Sinclair, 3 Shan. 159 (1874).

             Where a settlement, made by the personal representative with the clerk of the probate court, was, by the court, approved, and the amount of the shares found due certain parties as legatees was ascertained, and the money was ordered by the court to be paid into the office of the clerk, it may be paid out by the clerk to those so found by the settlement to be entitled thereto, without an order of the court so directing.

             For the purposes of this section, “persons interested in the estate” means all persons who may be entitled to receive, or who have received, any property or interest that is required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent, or any benefit whatsoever with respect to any such property or interest, whether under a will, or intestacy, or by reason of any transfers, trust, estate, interest, right, power, relinquishment of power, gift in contemplation of death, gift taking effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, or any other transfer inter vivos that is subject to federal death taxes, or the proceeds of any insurance policies that are subject to federal death taxes.

             Whenever the personal representative of an estate has paid an estate or death tax to the government of the United States under any federal tax law now in effect or hereafter enacted by congress, upon, or with respect to, any property required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent under any federal tax law, the amount of the tax so paid, except in a case where a testator otherwise directs in the testator's will, shall be equitably prorated among the persons interested in the estate to whom such property is or may be transferred or to whom any benefit accrues. This proration shall be made by the personal representative in the proportion, as near as may be, that the value of the property, interest or benefit of each interested person bears to the total value of the property, interests and benefits received by all persons interested in the estate, except that in making the proration allowances shall be made for any exemptions granted by the law imposing the tax and for any deductions allowed by that law for the purpose of arriving at the value of the net estate; and, except that in cases where a trust is created, or other provision made by which any person is given an interest in income, or an estate for years, or for life, or only temporary interest in any property or fund, the tax on both the temporary interest and on the remainder thereafter shall be charged against and paid out of the corpus of the property or fund without apportionment between remainders and temporary estate.

             So far as is practicable, and unless otherwise directed by the will of the decedent, the tax shall be paid by the personal representative, as such, out of the estate before its distribution. In all cases in which any property required to be included in the gross estate does not come into the possession of the personal representative, as such, the personal representative shall have the power and the duty, to recover from whomever is in possession, or from the persons interested in the estate, the proportionate amount of the tax, including interest, attorney fees and other costs of collection, payable by the persons interested in the estate with which the persons interested in the estate are chargeable under this section.

In making the proration, allowances shall be made for any exemptions granted by the Tennessee law imposing the tax and for any deductions allowed by that Tennessee law for the purpose of arriving at the value of the net estate.

             In the event the personal representative is unable to arrive at a satisfactory allocation of the tax, including interest, attorney fees and other costs of collection, among the beneficiaries and other persons interested in the estate as provided in subsections (b)-(e), the personal representative shall be authorized to file a petition in the probate court of the county in which the estate is being administered for the purpose of securing an adjudication with reference to the allocation. The probate court in such a case shall make a decree or order directing the personal representative to charge the prorated amounts against the persons against whom the tax, including interest, attorney fees and other costs of collection, has been so prorated, insofar as the personal representative is in possession of property or interests of such persons against whom the charge may be made, and summarily directing all other persons, against whom the tax, including interest, attorney fees and other costs of collection,  has been prorated or who are in possession of property or interests of those persons, to make payment of the prorated amounts to the personal representative. The probate court of the county in which the estate is being administered shall have jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding or dispute under this section and to make disposition thereof. All such proceedings shall be maintained according to the forms of chancery.

              Request of the estate's personal representative (PR) for additional attorney's fees for an appeal was properly denied because, even if the initial award of attorney's fees did not include the estimated 40 hours on appeal, there was no proper legal basis to award the PR with further attorney's fees solely from the remaining beneficiary's portion of the estate as the PR knew he intended to appeal and that she intended to leave only his share in the estate from which to seek costs from the appeal, which did not show the utmost good faith that was required from a fiduciary; and the PR did not demonstrate any legal basis to hold the beneficiary individually liable for her attorney's fees.

              Where the personal representative, without notice of unpaid debts, distributes the assets among the next of kin, after the expiration of the time within which the domestic creditors can sue the estate, and takes solvent refunding bonds, and reports them to the probate court, such bonds stand in place of the assets, and of the administrator's responsibility and bond, and exonerate him from all liability, and protect him, upon plea of “fully administered,” against the claims of creditors. Johnston v. Dew, 6 Tenn. 224, 1818 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1818); Maxwell v. Smith, 86 Tenn. 539, 8 S.W. 340, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1888).

              Refunding bonds are intended for the exclusive protection of the creditors of the estate who may come forward after the time for distribution, and establish their claims by judgment against the administrator, and the remedy on such bonds is given alone to the creditors of the estate.

             <p>
              Refunding bonds taken and becoming insolvent do not affect the liability of a co-obligor's estate; as, where the administrator takes refunding bonds which operate to exonerate the land of a deceased surety, such bond does not inure to the benefit of a deceased cosurety so as to exonerate the land of his estate, because the exoneration of the land of one surety does not operate as payment, so as to exonerate the land of a cosurety.

              The chancery court has jurisdiction independent of the statute. Bowers v. Lester, 49 Tenn. 456, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1871); Goodman v. Palmer, 137 Tenn. 556, 195 S.W. 165, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 168 (1917).

             <p>
              It is manifest the legislature did not intend that cases of complication and difficulty or dispute in the settlement of estates should be determined elsewhere than in that forum expressly created and qualified for that purpose. Bowers v. Lester, 49 Tenn. 456, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1871); Goodman v. Palmer, 137 Tenn. 556, 195 S.W. 165, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 168 (1917).

              Chancery jurisdiction is reserved by this section. Murgitroyde v. Cleary, 84 Tenn. 539, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1886).

             <p>
              Where the chancery court is duly resorted to to enforce a settlement in behalf of legatees or distributees, and jurisdiction is taken, the court may proceed to determine what is the net amount for distribution to the legatees or distributees, fix the compensation properly payable to the administrator and his solicitor, and determine the amount of costs or charges properly to be deducted. Goodman v. Palmer, 137 Tenn. 556, 195 S.W. 165, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 168 (1917).
             </p>
             <p>
              Probate court is without jurisdiction to determine disputed questions arising in the administration of estates; chancery being the proper forum. Chester v.

              This section does not deprive chancery of jurisdiction to determine complicated question as to who is entitled to fund in administrator's hands. Chester v. Turner, 153 Tenn. 451, 284 S.W. 365, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1925).

              The jurisdiction of the probate court to compel the payment of distributive shares or legacies is limited to summary applications where, by simple calculation from recognized full settlements, the amount can be ascertained, and it has no jurisdiction where there is a real and valid defense or contest as to the amount due, involving complicated accounts or controversies peculiarly proper for chancery jurisdiction.

              The petition in the probate court is to perform the office of a notice in a summary proceeding. The word “summarily” should be construed in the same sense in which it is used in motions against sheriffs, clerks, etc., where the balances are readily ascertained from the record or execution.

              Where a litigant dies, and parties claiming to be his heirs move to revive the suit, and the opposing litigant pleads that such parties are not the heirs or the sole heirs of the decedent, they may join issue on such plea, and the proof of heirship may be made in open court, or by the depositions of witnesses taken upon notice, or before the clerk upon a reference to him for that purpose; and the latter mode has been adopted in practice, as the most convenient.

      Acts 2017, ch. 290, § 16 provided that section 5 of the act, which amended this section, should take effect January 1, 2017. However, since a public chapter cannot become effective on a date prior to becoming law, the code commission deems the amendment by that act to take effect on July 23, 2017, in accordance with Tenn.

     <p>
      Acts 2013, ch. 360, § 2 provided that the act, which amended this section, shall apply to small estate affidavits filed on or after July 1, 2013.

      Acts 1997, ch. 426, § 26 provided that the amendments to this section by that act shall apply to all estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 1998, and to all wills, other documents and proceedings related thereto.

     <p>
      Amendments. The 2017 amendment, in (5)(A), rewrote (i) and (ii) which read: “(i) Either the tax receipt issued pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c08s67-8-420" target="_blank">67-8-420</a></cite>, or the certificate issued pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c08s67-8-409" target="_blank">67-8-409</a></cite>; and “(ii) An affidavit that each debt of the decedent is paid.”.

       <span class="boldspan">
        1. Construction of Insolvency Statutes.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Insolvency statutes must receive such construction as will advance the remedy intended by them, and as will suppress the evil of the appropriation of all the assets by some creditors to the exclusion of others. Mosier v. Zimmerman, 24 Tenn. 62, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1844); Reid v. Huff, 28 Tenn. 345, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1848); Rains v. Rainey, 30 Tenn. 261, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1850); Stamps v. Bell, 61 Tenn. 170, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 356 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       All the provisions of the Code as to insolvent estates, being parts of one entire system, are to be construed together. The fact that the one judicature or the other is the tribunal wherein the estate is being administered can have no influence on the construction of the various provisions of these statutes. Martin v. Blakemore, 52 Tenn. 50, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 231 (1871); Hurley v. Murrell, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 620 (1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the statutes embodied in this chapter create a complete system or plan for the administration of insolvent estates. Bashaw v. Temple, 115 Tenn. 596, 91 S.W. 202, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1906); Harness v. Hughett, 117 Tenn. 489, 97 S.W. 68, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1906); Edmonson v. Walker, 137 Tenn. 569, 195 S.W. 168, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 169 (1917), overruled, State ex. rel. Williamson County v. A&F Constr., — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 275 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       The object of insolvency statutes is the protection of the estate, not the personal representative, against waste in unnecessary costs, and the like. Arnold v. Burks, 157 Tenn. 18, 5 S.W.2d 633, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1928).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t30c05s30-5-101-NOTESTODECISIONS-2.JurisdictionofChancery.">
       <span class="boldspan">
        2. Jurisdiction of Chancery.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the chancery court for the ascertainment of debts, settlement of accounts, and sale of real estate to pay debts of a decedent is not dependent on the statute, but is inherent. Caruthers v. Caruthers, 70 Tenn. 264, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 173 (1879); Allen v. Shanks, 90 Tenn. 359, 16 S.W. 715, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test of insolvency of an estate is whether the personal assets are not sufficient to satisfy all debts. Arnold v. Burks, 157 Tenn. 18, 5 S.W.2d 633, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1928).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t30c05s30-5-101-NOTESTODECISIONS-3.EstatesLessthan$1,000inValue.">
       <span class="boldspan">
        3. —Estates Less than $1,000 in Value.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Under this section, exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court is confined to cases where the value of the whole estate, including both the real and personal property, does not exceed $1,000. Connell v. Walker, 74 Tenn. 709, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 201 (1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court has jurisdiction to subject the lands of a decedent to the payment of his debts, though the estate (real and personal) is worth less than $1,000, where there has been no suggestion of the insolvency of the estate and advertisement thereof as provided in this chapter, or where there has been such suggestion, but no advertisement thereof. Bashaw v. Temple, 115 Tenn. 596, 91 S.W. 202, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1906); Arnold v. Burks, 157 Tenn. 18, 5 S.W.2d 633, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where suggestion of insolvency was made in writing by the administrator to the probate court and the value of the estate was less than $1,000 the court had exclusive jurisdiction to sell the tract of land for the purpose of creating assets to pay debts. Miller v. Woodruff, 177 Tenn. 486, 151 S.W.2d 159, 1941 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1941).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t30c05s30-5-101-NOTESTODECISIONS-4.EstatesinExcessof$1,000inValue.">
       <span class="boldspan">
        4. —Estates in Excess of $1,000 in Value.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where the probate court has rightfully and first obtained jurisdiction of insolvency suit for the sale of lands to pay the debts of the decedent, it will retain it to the exclusion of the chancery court, where the jurisdiction is concurrent, and its decision cannot be reviewed by the chancery court, nor can the case be transferred to the chancery court. Parkes v. Gilbert, 60 Tenn. 97, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 417 (1873); Walsh v. Crook, 91 Tenn. 388, 19 S.W. 19, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1892).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t30c05s30-5-101-NOTESTODECISIONS-5.TransferorRemoval.">
       <span class="boldspan">
        5. Transfer or Removal.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The administration proceeding in the probate court may be transferred to the chancery court before suit is brought in the probate court, where the value of the estate (real and personal) is as much as $1,000, though the insolvency has been suggested and advertised, and creditors have filed claims in the county court. Steele v. Maness, 83 Tenn. 141, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition suggesting insolvency of an estate and for its removal from probate court to chancery court is premature when filed within six months from date of qualification of executor, where such suggestion and petition was by others than such executor. Arnold v. Burks, 157 Tenn. 18, 5 S.W.2d 633, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to remove an administration proceeding from the probate court, and deprive it of jurisdiction of the case, and confer jurisdiction of the proceedings on the chancery court, it is essential that a suggestion of insolvency be made in the probate court. Hyder v. Hyder, 16 Tenn. App. 64, 66 S.W.2d 235, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 39 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932); Motlow Milling Co. v. Warterfield, 178 Tenn. 634, 162 S.W.2d 378, 1942 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1942).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t30c05s30-5-101-NOTESTODECISIONS-6.RightsonTransferorRemoval.">
       <span class="boldspan">
        6. —Rights on Transfer or Removal.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The administration is transferred to the chancery court in the precise stage of progress it had reached in the probate court; and if claims had been uncontested (admitted), or established after contest in that court as provided in the statutes regulating administration in that court, they are not required to be proved again, nor can they be reviewed in the chancery court, except for some ground of fraud, or for the other equitable causes, such as would furnish ground for attacking judgments of courts. Steele v. Maness, 83 Tenn. 141, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       The transfer to chancery of insolvent administration does not carry with it the power to allot a year's support, since probate court has exclusive jurisdiction to allotting of support, but jurisdiction can be obtained by consent of parties. International Baking Co. v. Polk, 155 Tenn. 461, 295 S.W. 472, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Power of an executor to sell realty for payment of debts does not preclude sale in chancery on transfer of administration. Arnold v. Burks, 157 Tenn. 18, 5 S.W.2d 633, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       A general creditor's bill is not maintainable against an administrator, but a suit to administer an insolvent estate is, provided the administration has been removed from the county to the chancery court. Hyder v. Hyder, 16 Tenn. App. 64, 66 S.W.2d 235, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 39 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

       It is, primarily, made the duty of the executor or administrator to suggest insolvency of the estate to the clerk of the probate court, but any creditor may make the suggestion. Winn v. Slaughter, 52 Tenn. 191, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 250 (1871); Wade v. Fisher, 57 Tenn. 490, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 249 (1873); PREWETT v. GOODLETT, 98 Tenn. 82, 38 S.W. 434, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 206 (1896); Harness v.

      <p>
       The personal representative is not bound to know the fact of insolvency of the personal estate before he is authorized to make the suggestion of insolvency. Whenever he has reasonable grounds to apprehend the insolvency of the estate, he has the right to make the suggestion, and thus to protect himself against being compelled to pay the debts in full until the fact be ascertained. Where the suggestion was made in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, the administrator's bill for the administration of the estate in chancery will not be dismissed, but will be sustained, without waiting to ascertain the fact of insolvency. Cash v. Dickens, 70 Tenn. 254, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 170 (1879).

      </h4>
      <p>
       No time is prescribed within which the personal representative is required to make the suggestion of insolvency. He should make it whenever he ascertains the estate to be insolvent, or has reasonable grounds to apprehend the insolvency thereof. Gunn v. Boone, 54 Tenn. 8, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 409 (1871); Daniel v. Lowe, 54 Tenn. 361, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1872); Cash v. Dickens, 70 Tenn. 254, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 170 (1879); Rhea v. Meridith, 74 Tenn. 605, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 302 (1880); Bates v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the administrator failed to suggest the insolvency of the estate for nearly four years after his qualification, and for more than two years after he became aware of its condition, the delay was held to be unreasonably long, and his bill, based upon such suggestion, praying for the settlement and administration of the estate in chancery as an insolvent estate, was dismissed, with costs. The bill was not one seeking the sale of lands to pay debts. Daniel v. Lowe, 54 Tenn. 361, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the suggestion of insolvency was made and an insolvency bill was filed four years after grant of administration praying for administration of the estate in the chancery court, as an insolvent estate, it was sustained, the bill setting forth good and sufficient reasons for the delay.

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The legal import of the suggestion of insolvency by the executor or administrator is that he has ascertained that the personal assets are not sufficient to satisfy all the debts of the estate; and, therefore, that the estate is to be divided ratably among the creditors. Fleming v. Talliafer, 51 Tenn. 352, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1871); Ewing v. Maury, 71 Tenn. 381, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1879). See Norville v. Coble, 69 Tenn. 465, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1887); Bacchus v. Peters, 85 Tenn. 678, 4 S.W. 833, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1887); Lookout Bank v. Susong, 90 Tenn. 590, 18 S.W. 389, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1891); Donnell v. McCullough, 152 Tenn. 594, 280 S.W. 34, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The suggestion of insolvency will prevent the administrator's personal liability on account of his default to a scire facias, based on suggestion of devastavit, to make him personally liable, where such suggestion was made before such liability became fixed by judgment. Griffin v. Fowlkes, 2 Shan. 151 (1876).

       A creditor paid in full after suggestion may be compelled to restore the payment so far as in excess of pro rata due him. Donnell v. McCullough, 152 Tenn. 594, 280 S.W. 34, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the administrator has himself suggested the insolvency of the estate, and has instituted suit for the administration of the estate in the chancery court, he thereby invites immediate action by creditors, and they are not required to wait until the expiration of the six-month period specified by statute before filing their intervening petitions in the action so commenced. Levy v. Block, 164 Tenn. 60, 46 S.W.2d 63, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1932).
