       <p>
        The constitutional guaranty of jury trial (Tenn. Const. art. I, § 6) refers to the right in common law actions, not to suits of an equitable nature. Neely v. State, 63 Tenn. 174, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 224 (1874); Jackson, Morris & Co. v. Nimmo, 71 Tenn. 597, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1879); Miller v. Washington County, 143 Tenn. 488, 226 S.W. 199, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1920); Third Nat'l Bank v. American Equitable Ins. Co., 27 Tenn. App. 249, 178 S.W.2d 915, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 140 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943); Pass v. State, 181 Tenn. 613, 184 S.W.2d 1, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional provision that the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate does not guarantee the right of trial by a jury in any cause of which the chancery court has jurisdiction, exercised according to the forms by which such courts are accustomed to administer remedies. Exum v. Griffis Newbern Co., 144 Tenn. 239, 230 S.W. 601, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional guarantee of jury trial (Tenn. Const. art. I, § 6) refers to civil action and criminal prosecutions at common law but does not extend to suits in an equitable nature where such right is conferred only by statute. Harbison v. Briggs Bros. Paint Mfg. Co., 209 Tenn. 534, 354 S.W.2d 464, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 387 (1962), overruled in part, Ennix v. Clay, 703 S.W.2d 137, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 820 (Tenn. 1986); Bauman v. Smith, 499 S.W.2d 935, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the chancery court exercises concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit court in law cases, or where the chancery court is authorized to try cases in which there is a constitutional or special statutory right to a jury trial, a jury may be properly demanded. Ashe v. State, 518 S.W.2d 360, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 719 (Tenn. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless the general assembly acts to the contrary, the general rule of law in Tennessee is that a party to a suit of an inherently equitable nature in the chancery court cannot demand a jury trial as a matter of right. Hurt v. Earnhart, 539 S.W.2d 133, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 248 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).

        Under the provisions in this article, either party has a right to a jury to try and determine any proper issue of fact involved in any case pending in the chancery court. Allen v. Saulpaw, 74 Tenn. 477, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 276 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of rule of court regulating the matter, the demand of a jury to try issues of fact in chancery court may be made at any time before the cause is heard by the chancellor. Stepp v. Stepp, 11 Tenn. App. 578, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 40 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is the only source of right to trial by jury in chancery. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional guaranty of trial by jury refers only to actions at law, but where suits are tried in equity the right of trial by jury exists only to the extent provided by statute. Third Nat'l Bank v. American Equitable Ins. Co., 27 Tenn. App. 249, 178 S.W.2d 915, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 140 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase in this section excepting “those elsewhere excepted by law or by provisions of this Code” excepts from the right to jury trial only those cases which are excepted by the provisions of the Code and those statutory exceptions not found in the Code, or such as by their very nature must necessarily be deemed inappropriate and not a proper case to be submitted to the jury, or cases of such a complicated and intricate nature involving mixed questions of law and fact not suitable for solution by a jury. Moore v. Mitchell, 205 Tenn. 591, 329 S.W.2d 821, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 398 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suit to impress an equitable lien where there was no conflict in evidence in the trial, court of appeals could not reverse the cause for jury trial. Vick v. Vick, 60 Tenn. App. 600, 449 S.W.2d 717, 1968 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lines of cases holding that jury verdicts in chancery cases are advisory only and lines of cases holding that chancery jury verdicts have the same force and effect as jury verdicts at law are both correct, for the correct rule depends upon (1) the nature of the litigation, (2) the statutes in existence at the time, (3) whether the jury was called for by either of the parties or by the chancellor. Hurt v. Earnhart, 539 S.W.2d 133, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 248 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).

        Following the repeal of the former section a party to a lawsuit of an equitable nature could not demand a jury as a matter of right, and a chancellor, or a circuit or criminal court judge sitting as a chancellor in such an action, could submit issues of fact to a jury as he deemed appropriate but was not bound by the jury finding on the issues submitted.

       <p>
        The construction of the words “and all issues of fact in any proper case shall be submitted to one jury” is part of the legislative intent to make jury trials in chancery court conform to practice of common law, in that all issues of fact must be submitted to one jury and not tried piecemeal and litigants have no greater rights by jury trial in chancery court than litigants have in jury trial at common law. Bauman v. Smith, 499 S.W.2d 935, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).

        “Either party” must be construed to mean all parties having similar interests, in the sense of an entire party complainant or defendant, or all the complainants or all the defendants. It was not intended to split a single cause of action up into two separate trials, one before the court and the other before a jury. Burns v. Nashville, 142 Tenn. 541, 221 S.W. 828, 1919 Tenn.

        The chancery court has inherent jurisdiction in equity over a suit for accounting, and suits involving claims and counterclaims, where the accounts are too complicated to be dealt with in a court of law. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation of jurisdiction in equity, in a case of complicated accounts, is based upon the inadequacy of the legal remedy. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to what constitutes complexity of accounts, such as to authorize a court of equity to assume jurisdiction, must be determined by the chancellor in each particular case. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        If accounts are complicated, that of itself constitutes sufficient ground for the assumption of jurisdiction by court of equity; as well as where the account is made up of items for and against each party, or the items are numerous and extended over a long period of time. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).

        Where there was an action on several notes and to have security sold and applied and where answers and cross bills raised issues of fraud, deceit, subrogation, usury, and damages from a previous injunction and from conversion of the security, the accounting was so complicated as to justify the trial court in denying trial by jury.

Third Nat'l Bank v. American Equitable Ins. Co., 27 Tenn. App. 249, 178 S.W.2d 915, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 140 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        In equity cases where there is a trial by jury the jury does not try the whole case or render a general verdict for one party or the other, but tries only the disputed issues submitted to it in the form of questions, and answers them “Yes” or “No,” or states the amount or value when the question calls for that, then the chancellor, if he approves such answers decides the case on the answers of the jury, the undisputed facts and the applicable law. Third Nat'l Bank v. American Equitable Ins. Co., 27 Tenn. App. 249, 178 S.W.2d 915, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 140 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is sufficient evidence, which if believed would entitle complainant to a decree it is error for the chancellor to withdraw the issues from the jury. Henry v. Southern Fire & Casualty Co., 46 Tenn. App. 335, 330 S.W.2d 18, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 147 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).

        Jury findings supported by competent material evidence have same force and effect in chancery action as in jury trial at law. Davis v. Mason & Dixon Tank Lines, Inc., 539 S.W.2d 40, 1975 Tenn. App. LEXIS 185 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1975).

        It is error for the chancellor to refuse complainant's demand for jury trial of the issues of fact presented by his bill, and denied by the answer, alleging the making of a will by a testator when he was sane, and its destruction by him when insane, and seeking to set it up, and also alleging conveyance of the devised property by him while insane, and seeking to set it aside.

        The waiver of a jury demanded in the bill made by agreement at or before the first trial that the chancellor might try the case as a jury does not deprive the defendant of the right to demand a jury on a second or new trial, especially where it is not shown that there was any rule regulating the matter.

        There is no absolute right to trial by jury in a suit for which the chancery court has inherent, equitable jurisdiction, but the submission of facts to a jury in such a case is a matter within the discretion of the chancellor. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).

       <p>
        In a chancery suit for accounting, the question as to the right of a party to a jury trial is for the determination by the chancellor, from the pleadings, as to whether the case involves complicated accounting; and, if it does, the party has no absolute right to a trial by jury. Greene County Union Bank v. Miller, 18 Tenn. App. 239, 75 S.W.2d 49, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).

        In a suit on promissory notes, in which defendants filed a cross bill alleging that the notes in suit were procured by fraud, and that plaintiff had converted collateral security given by defendants to secure payment of the notes, which issues called for a complicated accounting, the chancellor properly refused to submit the issues to a jury.

        Chancery court could not deprive a defendant who has demanded a jury trial in his answer of the right to such jury trial given him by statute, even though defendant had not complied with rule of court requiring defendant to demand a jury by motion in court after joinder of issue, as the statute is mandatory and the court rule was in conflict therewith.

        In ejectment action seeking possession of land, compensatory and punitive damages and removal of cloud from title, verdict of jury as to compensatory damages was binding on chancellor rather than advisory only where jury was had on demand of complainant, amount of damages was in issue and record disclosed a substantial compliance with rules of court by complainant.

        On appeal of cases of a nonequitable nature tried in a chancery court before a jury, the verdict of the jury has all the weight and effect of a verdict at law, and the appellate court may review only to ascertain the presence of material facts to support the verdict.

        The verdict of a jury in a chancery case where there are several issues should be upon all of the issues, and if they cannot agree upon all, the court should enter a mistrial and submit all the issues to another jury, as it is not proper to take as settled the issues found by a former jury and submit to the new jury the unsettled issues only.

        A directed verdict is unknown in chancery practice. Whether requested to do so or not, it is the duty of the chancellor to withdraw, or decline to submit to the jury an issue to support which there is no evidence. When he does direct a verdict, however, it has the effect of withdrawing the issue as without support in the undisputed and uncontroverted evidence adduced. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Burton, 167 Tenn. 606, 72 S.W.2d 778, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1934); Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Strong, 19 Tenn. App. 404, 89 S.W.2d 367, 1935 Tenn. App. LEXIS 53 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1935).

          It is within the powers of a state to provide by statute for bringing into its courts nonresidents having interests in real property situated within the state for the purpose of enforcing a lien, or clearing a title, or subjecting the property to the satisfaction of debts and that jurisdiction in such cases may be obtained by publication of notice to such nonresidents. Connor v. Tennessee C. R. Co., 109 F. 931, 1901 U.S. App. LEXIS 4260 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1901).
         </p>
         <p>
          Originally, courts of chancery acted only in personam. Instance after instance arose where it was seen to be necessary that in order to do complete justice this rule should be relaxed. As a result the legislature passed this section. Bradley v. Rock Gardens Utility Dist., 186 Tenn. 665, 212 S.W.2d 657, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 596 (1948).
         </p>
         <p>
          Originally courts of chancery acted only in personam, and the rule is only changed by statute, which must be strictly construed. Grace v. Hunt, 3 Tenn. 341, 1 Cooke 341, 1813 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1813); Grewar v. Henderson, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 76 (1872).

          The right conferred by subdivision (a)(7) of this section being statutory, it must be strictly construed. Bradley v. Rock Gardens Utility Dist., 186 Tenn. 665, 212 S.W.2d 657, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 596 (1948).

          Proceedings against unknown parties are invalid upon publication alone, which does not strictly comply with statutory requirements. Bleidorn v. Pilot Mountain Coal & Mining Co., 89 Tenn. 166, 15 S.W. 737, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1890).
         </p>
         <p>
          This section provides for two classes of cases without discriminating between them. The one class requires the fact on which the publication is grounded to appear on the face of the bill, or by affidavit attached; and in the other class, the fact upon which publication is grounded must appear by the officer's return. If the bill is false, the proceedings are fraudulent and void, and the complainant must suffer the consequences; but if the officer's return be false, the proceedings are not thereby invalidated, and the remedy of the defendant is against the officer alone, unless there be collusion between the officer and the complainant. Grewar v. Henderson, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 76 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          Chancery is not confined in the exercise of its jurisdiction to decrees in personam. Robert v. Frogge, 149 Tenn. 181, 258 S.W. 782, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1924).

          Personal service of process on a nonresident defendant is dispensed with by statute, in chancery cases. Anderson v. Stribling, 160 Tenn. 453, 26 S.W.2d 131, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1930).
         </p>
         <p>
          The court cannot acquire jurisdiction by constructive or substituted service of process to render personal judgment against a nonresident defendant who does not appear; the rule is otherwise with respect to resident defendants. Frolich & Barbour v. Hanson, 155 Tenn. 601, 296 S.W. 353, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1927).
         </p>
         <p>
          The courts of this state have full authority to proceed against a nonresident upon seizure of his property within the state and publication, and such nonresident may be bound in such proceeding so far as his property in the state is concerned, but no further. Anderson v. Stribling, 160 Tenn. 453, 26 S.W.2d 131, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1930).

          A personal judgment may not be rendered against a nonresident defendant of whom jurisdiction is acquired only by publication notice. Lawson v. American Laundry Machinery Co., 165 Tenn. 180, 54 S.W.2d 712, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1932).
         </p>

          A personal judgment may not be rendered against a nonresident defendant against whom jurisdiction is acquired only by publication. Turnblazer v. Smith, 214 Tenn. 277, 379 S.W.2d 772, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 475 (1964).

          By way of dicta it was said that the word “nonresident” may include domiciliaries sojourning or residing elsewhere. Saul v. Saul, 122 F.2d 64, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 2907 (D.C. Cir. 1941).
         </p>
         <p>
          And, further if the statute should be so construed, the notice published pursuant to it would not be wanting in due process. Saul v. Saul, 122 F.2d 64, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 2907 (D.C. Cir. 1941).
         </p>
         <p>
          No personal judgment can be rendered against a nonresident served with notice only by publication. Perry v. Young, 133 Tenn. 522, 182 S.W. 577, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 116, L.R.A. (n.s.) 1917B385 (1916).
         </p>
         <p>
          Courts of law cannot entertain suit against a nonresident for a personal demand, upon publication alone, without attachment or other impoundment of property situated within the jurisdiction of the court; and want of jurisdiction over the nonresident is not, in such case, cured by the fact that a codefendant, jointly sued, but severally liable for the demand, was duly served with process. Farmers' & Traders' Bank of Allen County, 88 Tenn. 279, 12 S.W. 545, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1889).
         </p>
         <p>
          In a suit in chancery by minority certificate holders in a resident incorporated fraternal beneficiary association against it and a nonresident similar association to declare illegal and ultra vires an attempted merger of the two associations, to restrain the disposition of the assets of the resident association under such void contract, and to require the return to the nonresident association of its assets illegally and wrongfully received by the resident association and its officers, jurisdiction of the nonresident association may be obtained by substituted process and constructive service by publication, where jurisdiction of the resident association has been obtained by personal service of process, appearance, and answer, and the jurisdiction of the subject matter, as the property of the corporations, has been obtained by impoundment by injunction, by which the court acquires jurisdiction to determine the entire controversy. Knapp v. Supreme Commandery, U. O. G. C. W., 121 Tenn. 212, 118 S.W. 390, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1908).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where interest of a partner in assets of a nonresident partnership is attached, other partners may be brought in by publication in order to ascertain the rights of the partners. Gaines v. Fourth Nat'l Bank, 52 S.W. 467, 1898 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 158 (1898).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
     As attachment of land is not necessary to enforce a vendor's lien thereon, the court acquires jurisdiction by publication against a nonresident defendant, conforming to the requirements of this section, without complying with the requirements of §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c06s29-6-145" target="_blank">29-6-145</a></cite>. Kyle v. Philips, 65 Tenn. 43, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 296 (1873); Kemper-Thomas Paper Co. v. Shyer, 108 Tenn. 444, 67 S.W. 856, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 46 (1902).

          In suit to quiet title and to have rights declared, subdivision (a)(1) applies. Ray v. Haag, 1 Tenn. Ch. App. 249 (1901).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where in a suit to reform a deed the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and three of the defendants named in such suit resided in the county where the suit was brought and the other nonresident defendants were served by publication of the decree of the court allowing such reformation was immune from collateral attack. Globe & Republic Ins. Co. v. Shields, 170 Tenn. 485, 96 S.W.2d 947, 1936 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1936).
         </p>
         <p>
          Publication of notice in city newspaper of proceeding by city to sell land of nonresident for nonpayment of city taxes was constructive notice and binding on nonresident, since nonresident was not entitled to actual notice of accrual of city taxes on property and of proceeding to sell property for unpaid taxes, even though property had formerly been outside of city limits and was later taken in by city on extension of city limits. Moore v. Memphis, 184 Tenn. 92, 195 S.W.2d 623, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 264 (1946).
         </p>
         <p>
          Tax sale was void where jurisdiction over defendant was supposedly acquired by publication based on a not to be found return, but record showed that no return had in fact been made. Naylor v. Billington, 213 Tenn. 614, 378 S.W.2d 737, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1964).
         </p>
         <p>
          The return of the sheriff “not to be found” is a legal prerequisite to a publication upon that ground and without such return any decree returned by the chancery court is void to such party. Naylor v. Billington, 213 Tenn. 614, 378 S.W.2d 737, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1964).
         </p>

          A “reasonableness” standard is codified in the requirement of diligent inquiry; taxing authorities are not required to undertake extraordinary efforts to discover the identity and whereabouts of an interested party. Freeman v. City of Kingsport, 926 S.W.2d 247, 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 24 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).
         </p>
         <p>
          An order of pro confesso cannot be sustained where the order of publication was based upon an affidavit filed that the defendant was not to be found, because the statute requires that the order of publication should be based upon the officer's return. Grewar v. Henderson, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 76 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          The sheriff's return on the process of “not to be found in my county,” if premature, as where the process was not retained by the sheriff until the return day, would not authorize the publication. McGavock v. Young, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 529 (1877); Davis v. Reaves, 75 Tenn. 585, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 155 (1881).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
     Except to send a letter to encourage the property owner to receive process in person, the county did not attempt to give actual notice of the tax lien suit before it sold the land; notice did not comply with T.C.A. §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-203" target="_self">21-1-203</a></cite> and<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c05s67-5-2415" target="_blank">67-5-2415</a></cite> as the county did not exercise due diligence before returning the summonses not found and it did not comply with due process. Wilson v. Blount County, 207 S.W.3d 741, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 993 (Tenn. 2006).
         </p>
         <p>
          Subdivision (a)(7) of this section does not authorize service by publication upon a public corporation when the corporation has no officers or agents, and has never had any, and no one is named in the act creating the corporation upon whom service may be had. Bradley v. Rock Gardens Utility Dist., 186 Tenn. 665, 212 S.W.2d 657, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 596 (1948).

         <p>
          Attempted service on defendant utility district created by private act by means of service on secretary of state and by publication in a proceeding for a declaratory judgment that private act was unconstitutional was invalid where no commissioner or officer for utility district existed. Bradley v. Rock Gardens Utility Dist., 186 Tenn. 665, 212 S.W.2d 657, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 596 (1948).
         </p>
         <p>
          In a divorce suit against defendant whose residence is unknown, a recital in the bill and in the decree that the defendant is a nonresident will not give the court jurisdiction of the defendant. In a suit against a defendant whose residence is unknown, the complainant must state on oath, either in his bill or in an affidavit, and must prove that the residence of the defendant is unknown and that it cannot be ascertained after proper and diligent inquiry. A divorce decree rendered without actual or constructive notice is void; and if constructive notice be relied on, the statutes providing for the same must be strictly observed. Gallagher v. Knoxville Iron Co., 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 718 (1914).
         </p>
         <p>
          Service of process upon a non compos mentis defendant is not dispensed with by statute, and service is necessary to confer jurisdiction. Smith v. Smith, 159 Tenn. 36, 15 S.W.2d 747, 1928 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1929).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where process was not served upon person later declared to be of unsound mind judgment was invalid regardless of appearance of guardian ad litem. In re McCartney, 31 Tenn. App. 171, 213 S.W.2d 25, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 81 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1948).
         </p>
         <p>
          A rule of court, making “any process” other than final process returnable to rule days, includes not only the process provided for in this section, but all process except that which is final. Fellows v. Cook, 57 Tenn. 81, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 401 (1872).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where a husband had actively aided wife in procuring a divorce in Tennessee from her former husband and had advised her not to correct an allegation in her complaint that her former husband probably claimed his legal residence in Massachusetts, the husband could not, in order to annul his own marriage, question the validity of the notice given to the former husband in the divorce proceeding on either the ground of fraud or lack of due process, particularly where the former husband had not questioned the notice or the divorce. Saul v. Saul, 122 F.2d 64, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 2907 (D.C. Cir. 1941).
         </p>
         <p>
          In order to entitle the defendants to appear and defend after judgment pro confesso, they must all show merits, except in the cases of nonresidents and those whose residences are unknown. Owens v. Sims, 43 Tenn. 544, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1866).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where complainant held life estate in real property with remainder to her unborn child or children in fee, valid service by publication could not be had on such unborn child or children under provisions of this section in action by life tenant against such unborn child or children for permission to sell property and invest proceeds or to mortgage property for improvements or to have title vested in life tenant in fee. Rodgers v. Unborn Child or Children of Rodgers, 204 Tenn. 96, 315 S.W.2d 521, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 249 (1958).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
     In the brothers' suit to void the tax sale regarding their previously jointly-owned inherited property, a directed verdict in favor of the new owners was proper as the process server used due diligence in attempting to serve the brothers with notice of the tax suit pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-203ol1a3" target="_self">21-1-203(a)(3)</a></cite>, and there was no violation of the brothers'  due process rights, because of the deputy's actions or the constructive notice provided by the county after personal service on the brothers was unsuccessful. Smith v. Gregory, 253 S.W.3d 175, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 676 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 292 (Tenn. Apr. 14, 2008).
         </p>
         <p>
          <p>
     In a termination of parental rights proceeding, given the absence of information regarding steps taken to identify the father, an adoption agency did not carry its burden of demonstrating the diligent inquiry required by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-203ol1a" target="_self">21-1-203(a)</a></cite> in order to use service by publication, as simply asking the birth mother if she knew the name of the father and then giving up was not sufficient; the location of the party, the name of the host of the party, the names of attendees of the party, and the type of vehicle in which the child was conceived were all obvious areas of inquiry. Adoption Place, Inc. v. Doe, 273 S.W.3d 142, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 750 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2007), appeal denied, The Adoption Place, Inc. v. Doe, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (Tenn. Feb. 4, 2008).
         </p>
         <p>
          Default judgment terminating a mother's parental rights was void because the father failed to make diligent efforts to locate the mother to accomplish personal service and failed to seek a court order allowing him to serve the mother by publication; the only efforts the father took to locate the mother were sending service of process to a home in which he knew the mother no longer resided and consulting with counsel. Turner v. Turner, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 398 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 7, 2014), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 473 S.W.3d 257, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 831 (Tenn. Oct. 21, 2015).
         </p>
         <p>
          Tennessee statutes authorize dispensing with personal service of process in a proceeding to terminate parental rights only if the defendant's residence is unknown and cannot be ascertained upon diligent inquiry, and the plaintiff has asked for an order authorizing constructive service by publication and has supported the request with an affidavit, and only when the residence of the defendant cannot be obtained through diligent inquiry may a party resort to constructive service by publication. Turner v. Turner, 473 S.W.3d 257, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 831 (Tenn. Oct. 21, 2015).
         </p>
         <p>
          Record contained neither a motion from the father requesting an order authorizing constructive service by publication nor an affidavit describing the diligent inquiries that were made to locate the mother's whereabouts or her residence, and there was no order from the trial court authorizing constructive service by publication; the father's failure to comply with the statutory requirements necessary for resorting to constructive service by publication deprived the trial court of personal jurisdiction over the mother, and the judgment terminating the mother's parental rights was void. Turner v. Turner, 473 S.W.3d 257, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 831 (Tenn. Oct. 21, 2015).
         </p>
         <p>
          Even if plaintiff were allowed to utilize the statutes in this breach of contract case, the constructive service by publication attempted by plaintiff was insufficient, given that defendant made his home outside the area of normal circulation of the paper plaintiff chose, and thus the publication was not reasonably calculated to give defendant notice of the suit. Ebulueme v. Onoh, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 260 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 24, 2019).

         The fact that the clerk and master, who is also receiver, is complainant, and makes the affidavit of nonresidence, does not disqualify him for making the order of publication. Akin v. Watson, 52 S.W. 905, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 47 (1899).

         Though a judgment pro confesso does not show all the facts of publication, it will be sufficient evidence of publication if it recite that publication was made according to law. Savage v. Savage, 4 Tenn. App. 277, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 189 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).

         The grounds upon which the order was made need not be set out, and an entry which purports to state the grounds is not conclusive that upon that, and no other, the order was granted. Finch v. Frymire, 36 S.W. 883, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 13 (1896).

         Publication for a nonresident, made in a proceeding to sell lands of delinquent taxpayers due to a city, is void where it fails to indicate in its caption or elsewhere that the city is the complainant by whom, or for whose benefit, the suit is prosecuted. Gilliland v. Cullum, 74 Tenn. 521, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 287 (1880); Donaldson v. Nealis, 108 Tenn. 638, 69 S.W. 732, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1902).

         Jurisdiction for decree against unknown parties, whether residents or nonresidents, not appearing in defense of suit, depends upon strict compliance with the statute as to publication for them. Ferriss v. Lewis, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 291 (1875); Bleidorn v. Pilot Mountain Coal & Mining Co., 89 Tenn. 166, 15 S.W. 737, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1890).

        <p>
         The publication must be based upon a sworn statement of the complainant, his agent or attorney, made in his bill or by separate affidavit, that the defendants' names are unknown and cannot be ascertained upon diligent inquiry. Ferriss v. Lewis, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 291 (1875); Bleidorn v. Pilot Mountain Coal & Mining Co., 89 Tenn. 166, 15 S.W. 737, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         Publication for “unknown” defendants, based solely upon the averment supported by affidavit that they are nonresidents of the state, is unauthorized and void, and gives the court no jurisdiction of such parties. Bleidorn v. Pilot Mountain Coal & Mining Co., 89 Tenn. 166, 15 S.W. 737, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         Defendants to a bill, who are not otherwise described therein than as “the heirs of L. Bleidorn,” must be proceeded against as “unknown” parties. They are not named in the bill. Bleidorn v. Pilot Mountain Coal & Mining Co., 89 Tenn. 166, 15 S.W. 737, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         <p>
   In a termination of parental rights proceeding, given the absence of information regarding steps taken to identify the father, an adoption agency did not carry its burden of demonstrating the diligent inquiry required by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-203ol1a" target="_self">21-1-203(a)</a></cite> in order to use service by publication, as simply asking the birth mother if she knew the name of the father and then giving up was not sufficient; the location of the party, the name of the host of the party, the names of attendees of the party, and the type of vehicle in which the child was conceived were all obvious areas of inquiry. Adoption Place, Inc. v. Doe, 273 S.W.3d 142, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 750 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2007), appeal denied, The Adoption Place, Inc. v. Doe, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (Tenn.

         Where a nonresident defendant is made a party to a bill by publication of an order requiring him to appear, the fact of publication may be proved to the court by the production of the newspaper or by affidavit of the printer, publisher, or foreman. It is sufficient for the record to state that it appeared to the satisfaction of the court that publication has been made. The court is not bound to show the proofs, because, being a superior court, its proceedings are presumed to be correct. Kilcrease's Heirs v. Blythe, 25 Tenn. 378, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 108 (1845); Gilchrist v. Cannon, 41 Tenn. 581, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1860); Claybrook v. Wade, 47 Tenn. 555, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 172 (1870); Martin v. Porter, 51 Tenn. 407, 1871 Tenn.

         Even if plaintiff were allowed to utilize the statutes in this breach of contract case, the constructive service by publication attempted by plaintiff was insufficient, given that defendant made his home outside the area of normal circulation of the paper plaintiff chose, and thus the publication was not reasonably calculated to give defendant notice of the suit.

         Where publication is made for a nonresident defendant, the clerk of the court in which the suit is filed shall mail a copy of the complaint or, after the first publication, mail a copy of the newspaper clipping containing the publication to the nonresident defendant, directed to the nonresident defendant's last known address; and the clerk shall make an entry upon the clerk's docket so showing. The clerk shall mail the copy of the complaint or published notice by return receipt certified or registered mail. The return of the receipt signed by the defendant or the defendant's duly authorized agent, or its return marked refused, evidenced by appropriate notation of that fact by the postal authorities, and filed as a part of the record by the clerk, with notation on the docket of the true facts, shall be evidence of personal notice. In the event the return receipt does not establish that it was signed by the defendant or the defendant's authorized agent or that the notice was refused, then the court may find through independent proof that the defendant had actual notice in compliance with notice requirements. If the court does not find that the defendant had actual notice, it may order new publication on applicable grounds, or order such other and further action to be taken to give the defendant notice.

         In those counties where the divorce referee mails notice of the filing of the divorce and a copy of the complaint to a nonresident defendant by certified or registered mail return receipt requested, it shall not be necessary for the clerk of the court to also mail notice. Notice to the nonresident defendant from the divorce referee shall be sufficient, subject to the requirements of evidence of notice as set forth in subsection (a); provided, that the return receipt is filed as part of the record, with notation on the docket of the true facts. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to have changed or amended requirements of the law as to venue or jurisdiction.

         To the extent that this section may be considered to relieve the court of the obligation to give notice by mail to a nonresident defendant whose last known place of residence is known or can be ascertained upon inquiry, the statute is in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States and void. Baggett v. Baggett, 541 S.W.2d 407, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 548 (Tenn. 1976). (Decision prior to 1977 amendment.)

         Notice by publication is not enough with respect to a person whose name and address are known or very easily ascertainable and whose legally protected interests are directly affected by the proceedings in question. Where the names and post office addresses of those affected by a proceeding are at hand, the reasons disappear for resort to means less likely than the mails to apprise them of its pendency.

         <p>
          It is no objection to the execution of a decree rendered against a defendant that it was founded on a bill taken for confessed, without personal service; but the court may require the complainant to give sufficient security, in such sum as the court deems proper, to abide by and perform such order touching the restitution of property, or repayment of money, as the court may and should make, upon the defendant subsequently setting aside the decree, and successfully resisting the complainant's suit.

           This admirable provision of the Code deserves to be borne in mind, and properly enforced by the courts; and security should be required in all cases falling within the law, before permitting a complainant to execute his decree, unless he makes it absolute.

Jones v. Anderson, 250 S.W.3d 894, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 608 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 26, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Feb. 25, 2008).

             <p>
              The appointment of a guardian ad litem by the court is valid, though made without affidavit of the minority of the defendants. Martin v. Porter, 51 Tenn. 407, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 182 (1871).

             <p>
              It is not proper that the solicitor of the adverse party should be the solicitor and guardian ad litem of the minor defendants to a cause. Morgan v. McSpadlen, 2 Shan. 86 (1876).
             </p>
             <p>
              In the appointment of a guardian ad litem, it is the duty of the court to select one learned in law, capable of investigating and protecting the interest of his ward. Morgan v. McSpadlen, 2 Shan. 86 (1876).

              The master is not authorized to set aside an order taking a bill for confessed, except upon an affidavit showing good cause why an answer was not sooner filed, and the tender of a sufficient answer; and the affidavit must be made by the party himself, unless the facts relied on are peculiarly within the knowledge of the person tendering the affidavit; and a pro confesso against several defendants cannot ordinarily be set aside as to all of them upon an answer sworn to by only one of them. Cook v. Dews, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 496 (1875).
             </p>
             <p>
              Where a pro confesso is set aside by the clerk and master every prerequisite of the statute must be shown to exist as the clerk and master is a mere ministerial officer and cannot act except under the conditions prescribed by the statute but the action of the chancellor in setting aside a pro confesso in a judicial action is exercised in his sound discretion and cannot be disturbed except for abuse of that discretion. Bailey v. Schubert, 203 Tenn. 660, 315 S.W.2d 249, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 232 (1958).

               It is a proper decree in foreclosing a mortgage or deed of trust, to order a sale of the land for cash, free from the equity of redemption, in accordance with the contract of the parties as embodied in their deed. Hill v. Hillman, 74 Tenn. 715, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 202 (1881).
              </p>
              <p>
               If the mortgage provides for redemption, it will not be barred on foreclosure sale, because the court's decree must conform to the contract of the parties. Clark v. Jones, 93 Tenn. 639, 27 S.W. 1009, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 9, 42 Am. St. Rep. 931 (1894); Union Trust Co. v. Chattanooga E. R. Co., 101 Tenn. 297, 47 S.W. 422, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1898).

               The general rule is that a person arrested upon an attachment to answer for a contempt is entitled to bail or to give a bond for his appearance; and it seems to be a practice to extend this rule to attachments for contempt in not paying alimony or support. But there is no authority for such a practice. The chancery rule is that an attachment for nonperformance of a decree, unlike other attachments for contempt, is not a bailable process; and the person attached for nonperformance must be committed to or detained in prison.

             <p>
              In all cases remanded by the supreme court or court of appeals to any court for the execution of an order of reference, order of sale or for other proceedings directed in the decree of the appellate court or in the decree of the lower courts as affirmed or modified by the appellate court, the cases shall be deemed reinstated in the lower court from the time of filing with the clerk and master or clerk of the court a certified copy of the decree or mandate of the appellate court; and thereafter such cases may be proceeded in, in accordance with the decree of the appellate court, without any action of the lower court on the case. It shall not be necessary for the decree or mandate of the appellate court to be spread of record, in the lower court, by direction of the lower court, before the clerk and master, clerk of the court, or the parties may proceed in such case in accordance with the decree or mandate of the appellate court.
