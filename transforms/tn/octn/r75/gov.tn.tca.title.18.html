        Under the statutes and decisions of this state, a deputy clerk can exercise all the powers of the principal clerk, and has full power to transact all the business of the clerk. Martin v. Porter, 51 Tenn. 407, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 182 (1871); Harris v. State, 100 Tenn. 287, 45 S.W. 438, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1897); Wilkerson v. Dennison, 113 Tenn. 237, 80 S.W. 765, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 20, 106 Am. St. Rep. 821 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        When, due to the absence of the regular judge, a special judge is elected by the attorneys of the court, a deputy clerk has authority to hold such election. Harris v. State, 100 Tenn. 287, 45 S.W. 438, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1897).

        A person appointed deputy clerk in any manner, either by parol or writing, without qualifying by taking the prescribed oath or otherwise, may discharge the duties of the office as a de facto deputy clerk, though he is not a de jure officer, and his official acts will be valid as to the public and all third persons.

        It is proper to make out three trial dockets, one for the court, one for the bar, and one for the clerk himself, and the clerk is entitled to 10 cents for entering each cause on each docket, making 30 cents for docketing each cause; but he is entitled to this compensation only for one time or term, except when the case is remanded to the rules or appearance docket.

         The evidences belonging to each party, except the depositions, may be entrusted to that party, but the court papers ought never to be out of the custody of the clerk or judge. The clerk is, both civilly and criminally, liable for the preservation of the records, and is responsible upon his bond for their preservation, and he is peculiarly the proper custodian of them.

         A bond to the effect that the officer will truly and faithfully perform all the duties of the office is a guaranty of the personal honesty of such officer and furnishes indemnity against his defalcations.

         County could not maintain an action of assumpsit against the personal representative of the deceased clerk of the county court (now county clerk) to recover the amount of money appropriated and paid by the county court under contract with his successor in office for the performance of certain official duties neglected by such deceased clerk in failing and neglecting to record marriage licenses and settlements made with guardians and administrators. This suit was not upon the bond, nor by any one who had been injured, but it was a suit to recover as upon an implied assumpsit for money paid for the work and labor of another without his request, or knowledge, and even after his death.

        <p>
         It is not necessary for the clerk to be appointed “special commissioner,” either by general appointment or by decree in the several causes in which he acts. When the clerk is ordered to perform duties not pertaining to his office proper, it is not necessary that he should be styled “special commissioner,” for without such designation, the sureties on his bond as special commissioner will be liable for his defaults in such capacity, though he was not specially appointed as such commissioner. Buford v. Cox, 71 Tenn. 518, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1879); State v. Cole, 81 Tenn. 367, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1884).

        <p>
         The appointment of a special commissioner is not under the Constitution, but under the authority conferred by statute. The duration of the appointment is not limited by law. This is left to the discretion of the court, according to the exigencies that may arise. If the duration of the appointment is not limited by the court in the order of appointment, the appointment continues until the duties of the trust are discharged. The special commissioner is properly a trustee, and the condition of the bond obliges him to perform all the duties of the trust. Williams v. Bowman, 40 Tenn. 678, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 199 (1859); Bowen v. Evans, 69 Tenn. 107, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1878); Horton v. Cope, 74 Tenn. 155, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 222 (1880); State v. Cole, 81 Tenn. 367, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1884).
        </p>
        <p>
         While the statutes in a certain sense annexed the office of special commissioner to that of the clerk, because they entitle the clerk to perform the duties of the office of commissioner and to receive the emoluments thereof, if he will execute a special bond, there is no merger of the two offices, and the duration of the appointment of a special commissioner is not limited by law, and it may continue beyond the term of the office of the clerk, if a successor to the commissioner shall not be appointed by the court when the individual ceases to be clerk.

         Where a clerk and master is reappointed and executes his bond as commissioner and receiver, the sureties on his first bond are only liable for the money received from the sales of land prior to the execution of his second bond, and the sureties upon his second bond are liable for all moneys received afterwards in such capacity.

         If a clerk of the county court (now county clerk) is reelected and qualified as his own successor, and has money on hand belonging to the office which has not been demanded during his first term of office, the sureties on his first bond will not be liable therefor, but the sureties on his second bond will be liable for the proper accounting therefor. Yoakley v. King, 78 Tenn. 67, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 143 (1882).
        </p>
        <p>
         If a clerk having money in his hands, either as clerk or special commissioner and receiver, becomes his own successor, the old sureties will be released and the new sureties will become liable therefor. The presumption in the absence of proof to the contrary is that the money was on hand at the time of the succession, and this presumption can only be removed by positive proof to the contrary, or at least by the production of the best evidence. The mere fact that the clerk's account in bank was overdrawn at the time of the succession is not sufficient, when the proof is clear that there was no defalcation during the first term. State v.

         The sureties on a special bond executed in a particular case are liable for no default outside such case, but are primarily liable to the extent of the bond for any default therein. The special bond does not discharge the other bonds in the particular case, but operates simply as a transfer of primary liability to the special bondsmen. After exhaustion of that bond the other bonds are liable. Longmire v. Fain, 89 Tenn. 393, 18 S.W. 70, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1890).

        In copying indictment upon the minutes and into the transcript on appeal, the clerk should copy all endorsements found thereon. Bird v. State, 103 Tenn. 343, 52 S.W. 1076, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1899).

        If the caption of an indictment states that the grand jury was composed of good and lawful men it is sufficient in that regard. Bonds v. State, 8 Tenn. 142, 8 Tenn. 143, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1827).

       <p>
        An indictment for a felony, otherwise valid, is not vitiated by the clerk's failure, in spreading it upon the minutes, to copy the endorsement “A true bill,” and the foreman's signature thereto, if there is a proper entry of record showing the return of such indictment by the grand jury. State v. Herron, 86 Tenn. 442, 7 S.W. 37, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        In copying indictment upon the minutes and into the transcript on appeal, the clerk should copy all endorsements found thereon, and it is a fatal defect if the indictment, as copied into the transcript, fails to show the endorsement “a true bill,” signed by the foreman of the grand jury. Bird v. State, 103 Tenn. 343, 52 S.W. 1076, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1899).

        It is the duty of the clerk to enter judgment as soon as he has entered the verdict, and he needs no authority from the court, either in the form of a written order or judgment signed by the court, approved by counsel, or otherwise. Wind Rock Coal & Coke Co. v. Robbins, 1 Tenn. App. 734, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to the common law practice, it was the duty of the clerk to enter judgment on the jury's verdict as soon as it was returned, and no authority from the court or any one else was required. McAlester v. Monteverde, 22 Tenn. App. 14, 115 S.W.2d 257, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 71 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).

        It was not error for trial judge to enter verdict immediately after verdict but rather it was his duty to do so both under the ancient common law and the decisions of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Leek v. State, 216 Tenn. 337, 392 S.W.2d 456, 1965 Tenn. LEXIS 580 (1965).

        The fact that the verdict and judgment were not entered until a subsequent term did not deprive a contestant of his right to file a motion for a new trial raising any question arising upon the record which was made and preserved at the trial term since he is not required to file such motion until after a judgment is entered.

   The term of a clerk and master may not be manipulated and altered by the feigned resignation and a simultaneous reappointment by the chancellor prior to the termination of the current term of office of six years; such bogus resignations and reappointments are to be disregarded in determining the lawful tenure of a clerk and master. In re Appointment of Clerk &amp; Master, 670 S.W.2d 215, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 786 (Tenn. 1984), cert. denied, Marshall v. McMahan, <cite class="us_code">469 U.S. 981</cite>, <cite class="s_court">105 S.

   A clerk and master may lawfully resign his office prior to the expiration of his six-year term of office, but, if he does so, he may not be reappointed to that office unless some other person has intervened as such clerk and master by a bona fide appointment.
