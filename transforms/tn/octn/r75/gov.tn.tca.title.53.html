        In personal injury action against drug manufacturer and vascular surgeon arising out of disability allegedly suffered from translumbar aortogram, refusal to charge that drug manufacturer marketed misbranded drug in that advertising brochure was misleading was not error because brochure represented that drug used in aortogram was of “low toxicity” where drug was only used as prescription drug by highly skilled surgeons in specialized field and evidence was to the effect that drug was used by surgeon performing the aortogram and majority of other specialists performing the test despite existence of less toxic agents because better results were believed to be achieved by the drug and term was relative depending on circumstances and part of body where used.

        In a personal injury action against a restaurant owner, contention of plaintiff that injuries resulted from eating of contaminated ham hock sold by restaurant owner and that the sale was in violation of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t53c01s53-1-103ol1a" target="_self">53-1-103(a)</a></cite> and this section was without merit where there was not a scintilla of evidence in the record that the food was adulterated or contained deleterious ingredients.

       <p>
        Trial court properly denied the restaurant summary judgment on the customer's negligence per se claim based on this section because due to the evidence regarding food temperature violations at the restaurant the customer raised a question of material fact as to whether the oysters served were adulterated under this section and thus whether the restaurant violated the statute. Bissinger v. New Country Buffet, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 331 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 6, 2014), appeal denied, In re Estate of Bissinger, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 905 (Tenn. Oct. 20, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the oyster suppliers presented evidence as to the standard of care applicable to their handling of oysters for sale and that they did not breach that standard of care, and because the restaurant customer did not offer any proof that the suppliers failed to follow the procedures they described or offer any other evidence of improper handling of the oysters, the suppliers were properly granted summary judgment on the negligence claim, Bissinger v. New Country Buffet, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 331 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 6, 2014), appeal denied, In re Estate of Bissinger, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 905 (Tenn. Oct. 20, 2014).

        Trial court did not err by declining to grant the restaurant's summary judgment on the customer's claims of products liability or breach of the implied warrant of merchantability because if the restaurant was negligent in its handling of the oysters its conduct may have allowed the bacteria to proliferate and therefore actions of the restaurant may have rendered the oysters unfit for consumption.

         The Unfair Milk Sales Act, compiled in title 53, ch. 3, part 2,must be construed to give effect to the legislative purpose, not to foster the very evils it was intended to prohibit. Hogue v. Kroger Co., 213 Tenn. 365, 373 S.W.2d 714, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 393 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Unfair Milk Sales Act, compiled in title 53, ch. 3, part 2, was designed to prevent destruction of the small retailer by financially strong competitors who are able to sell below their costs for extended periods of time. Hogue v. Kroger Co., 213 Tenn. 365, 373 S.W.2d 714, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 393 (1964).

        <p>
         The Unfair Milk Sales Act, compiled in title 53, ch. 3, part 2, is not a resale price maintenance or “fair trade” statute, but is designed to prevent “loss-leader” sales and other unfair sales practices. Walker v. Bruno's, Inc., 650 S.W.2d 357, 1983 Tenn. LEXIS 775 (Tenn. 1983).

         Where appellants sold milk at their invoiced price, plus eight percent cost, and gave trading stamps in addition, appellee properly sought a declaratory judgment of his right under the “Unfair Milk Sales Act”, compiled in title 53, ch. 3, part 2, to sell milk at the posted price less an amount equal to the cost of the trading stamps. Hogue v. Kroger Co., 213 Tenn. 365, 373 S.W.2d 714, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 393 (1964).

         On rehearing, a retail milk dealer, who was denied the right to meet unlawful prices set by a competitor, contended that due process clauses were violated because a retailer has no way of knowing whether the competitor's prices are lawful, and can be prosecuted if he meets such price and it turns out to be unlawful; however, such contention is without merit, as this section sets out the proper procedures.

         The “clean hands” rule does not necessarily apply in a declaratory judgment suit, and the fact that appellee had at times given redeemable coupons did not preclude his declaratory judgment action to determine his right under this section to sell milk at the appellant's posted price less an amount equal to the cost of the trading stamps.

        Food may be examined or sampled by the commissioner as deemed necessary for the enforcement of this part. The commissioner may place a hold order on any food that the commissioner believes is in violation of this part or rules and regulations, upon written notice to the operator specifying particular reasons for the hold order. The commissioner shall tag, label, or otherwise identify any food subject to a hold order. No food subject to a hold order shall be used, served, sold, or moved from the establishment. The hold order may state that the food be held while confirmation is obtained that the condition violates this part or rules and regulations. The hold order may also order the operator to destroy food that violates this part or rules and regulations. The commissioner shall permit storage of the food under the conditions specified in the hold order, unless storage is not possible without risk to the health of the public, in which case immediate destruction shall be ordered and accomplished. The hold order shall state that a request for a hearing may be filed within ten (10) days. If a request for a hearing is received, the hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after receipt of the request. On the basis of evidence produced at the hearing, the hold order may be rescinded, or the owner or person in charge may be directed by written order to denature or destroy such food or to bring it into compliance with this part.

        Because defendant had to possess the drug in order to have taken it from the pharmacy during the aggravated robbery, and nothing indicated that he formed a new intent to possess the drug after he committed the robbery intending to take the drug, his separate convictions for misdemeanor simple possession of the drug, felony simple possession of the drug, and possession of a legend drug violated his double jeopardy rights.

          Trial court properly reversed the determination of the Department of Health that a physician assistant (PA) failed to register with the Controlled Substances Monitoring Database (CSMD) and to check the CSMD before prescribing controlled substances because the record did not contain substantial and material evidence to support a finding the PA had notice that she was required to register with the CSMD and check with the CSMD before prescribing controlled substances.

         <p>
          Trial court did not err in awarding a physician assistant attorney fees and costs because the facts were not sufficient for the Department of Health to charge Sparks with a violation; the Physician Assistants Act does not include a requirement that a supervising physician be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the statutes governing health-related boards require them to give notice of changes in the applicable laws prior to bringing charges for enforcement.

          Trial court properly reversed the determination of the Department of Health that a physician assistant (PA) failed to register with the Controlled Substances Monitoring Database (CSMD) and to check the CSMD before prescribing controlled substances because the record did not contain substantial and material evidence to support a finding the PA had notice that she was required to register with the CSMD and check with the CSMD before prescribing controlled substances.

          Trial court did not err in awarding a physician assistant attorney fees and costs because the facts were not sufficient for the Department of Health to charge Sparks with a violation; the Physician Assistants Act does not include a requirement that a supervising physician be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the statutes governing health-related boards require them to give notice of changes in the applicable laws prior to bringing charges for enforcement.

         Prior to the 1973 amendment, the statute by imposing a $250 cost bond as a condition precedent to the hearing before the commissioner of safety violated the rights of indigent owners to due process under the fourteenth amendment.

         All parties to the proceeding had the statutory right to have those witnesses necessary for a full and complete hearing subpoenaed for the hearing. Fell v. Armour, 355 F. Supp. 1319, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10982 (M.D. Tenn. 1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Plaintiff was a proper representative of a class consisting of all those persons who have had or will have conveyances owned by them seized pursuant to the authority of the Tennessee Drug Control Act of 1971 (repealed). Fell v. Armour, 355 F. Supp. 1319, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10982 (M.D. Tenn. 1972).

         Commissioner of safety is not required to set a date for a hearing within 15 days unless a defendant complies with the statutory requirements. Johnson v. Roberts, 638 S.W.2d 401, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 393 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

         There is no right to a jury trial in Tennessee statutory proceedings involving the forfeiture of personal property. Helms v. Tennessee Dep't of Safety, 987 S.W.2d 545, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (Tenn. 1999), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 987 S.W.2d 545, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 229 (Tenn. 1999).

         Prior to the 1973 amendment, the statute failed to provide to owners of seized conveyances notice subsequent to seizure sufficient to comport with the requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. Fell v. Armour, 355 F. Supp. 1319, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10982 (M.D. Tenn. 1972).

         Where the department of safety had knowledge of petitioner's possible proprietary interest in property confiscated in connection with a drug arrest, it was required to give notice to the petitioner of the seizure and possible forfeiture.

         Claimant's fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination were not violated, since notice of proposed forfeiture and sale of his plane in absence of claim and request for hearing was issued to claimant and signed by him at the time of seizure, but never subsequently acted upon by him. Hayes v. Armour, 407 F. Supp. 837, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16695 (W.D. Tenn. 1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where plaintiff failed to show that the proceedings under statutory forfeiture procedures, which provided for forfeiture of conveyances used, or intended to be used, for transportation of contraband such as illegal drugs or controlled substances, were criminal in nature or that he was called upon to testify or produce evidence that might be used against him in the separate criminal case in which he was charged with possession of illegal drugs, the plaintiff failed to prove that this part was unconstitutional. Hayes v. Armour, 407 F. Supp. 837, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16695 (W.D. Tenn. 1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where forfeiture serves remedial goal of discouraging use of property for illegal purposes, abates a nuisance by ensuring persons do not profit from illegal acts, and acts as deterrent, there is no punishment for purposes of double jeopardy. Stuart v. State Department of Safety, 963 S.W.2d 28, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (Tenn. 1998).

         Evidence was sufficient to sustain a forfeiture where the owner's credibility was inherently suspect because the property was confiscated after she was caught selling illegal drugs, and the record provided ample basis to conclude that the bulk of the owner's purchases were not made with legitimate funds. McEwen v. Tenn. Dep't of Safety, 173 S.W.3d 815, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 157 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).

         Co-owner of a mobile home lacked standing to contest the forfeiture of currency that was properly seized as proceeds from drug trafficking during a search of the mobile home, which was leased to the co-owner's adult child, because the co-owner failed to demonstrate an ownership interest in the currency. The trial court's application of an incorrect standard of review was harmless error as, under the correct standard of review, the evidence preponderated in favor of the administrative law judge's determination that the co-owner lacked standing.

           Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t53c11s53-11-401ol1a5" target="_self">53-11-401(a)(5)</a></cite> because: (1) Defendant told officers that defendant had been allowing another person to make methamphetamine in defendant's house for the past six months; (2) Co-defendant would telephone defendant in the evenings to ensure that it was alright for co-defendant to come home; and (3) Defendant gave the officers permission to search the house and never indicated that defendant did not have such authority. State v. Starkey, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 356 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 2, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 789 (Tenn. Aug. 27, 2007).

           State failed to adduce sufficient proof to establish the offense of maintaining a dwelling where controlled substances were used or sold, as although a witness testified that defendant initially had a bedroom in a house, the witness took over this bedroom, multiple witnesses testified that defendant instead lived in an apartment, and there was no proof that defendant contributed money to pay the rent or other expenses, provided furnishings, or participated in the upkeep of the house.

          <p>
           Evidence was sufficient to support convictions for possession of a Schedule III drug with intent to deliver and maintaining a dwelling where controlled substances are kept or sold because defendant acquired pills by stealing them from his sister, and then he proposed selling them as a means of raising gas money. Drugs were found hidden in defendant's freezer. State v. Simpson, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 771 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 5, 2014).

           Testimony of defendant's daughter, an accomplice, regarding the sale of cocaine supported defendant's convictions, as it was corroborated by the accomplice's testimony that she asked the buyer what he needed when he arrived, that she immediately called defendant when she discovered recording equipment, and the buyer's testimony that defendant approached him with what appeared the be a handgun after discovery of the wire.

           Because defendant's sentences for sale of a Schedule III controlled substance within a drug-free zone, delivery of a Schedule III controlled substance within a drug-free zone, and maintaining a dwelling where a controlled substance was kept or sold were within the appropriate range, the trial court's sentencing determinations were entitled to a presumption of reasonableness.

          <p>
           Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering defendant to serve his total effective sentence of two years in confinement because defendant was not eligible for community corrections as he was convicted under the Drug-Free School Zone Act; defendants dealing drugs in school zones who were sentenced to the minimum term in their sentencing range would serve 100% of their sentences; and defendant received concurrent sentences of two years for each conviction of sale of a Schedule III controlled substance within a drug-free zone, delivery of a Schedule III controlled substance within a drug-free zone, and maintaining a dwelling where a controlled substance was kept or sold, which were the minimum sentences for those offenses.

           Conviction for attempting to obtain a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception, or subterfuge was affirmed because the prescription was on a prescription slip that listed an out of date address of the doctor, and the signature was not the doctor's.

A receipt for the prescription was underneath the driver's seat of defendant's car, and a carbon copy of the prescription that was filled on December 9, and refilled on December 31 was in the center console of defendant's car.

           Where plaintiff failed to show that the proceedings under statutory forfeiture procedures were criminal in nature or that he was called upon to testify or produce evidence that might be used against him in the separate criminal case in which he was charged with possession of illegal drugs, the plaintiff failed to prove that part 2 of this chapter was unconstitutional.

           Trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider appellants'  arguments for the return of seized property because it was a civil matter under the jurisdiction of the Department of Safety, and any improper notices of seizure did not deprive the Department of Safety jurisdiction; viewing the seizures at issue as drug related was not improper. Harmon v. Jones, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 560 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 226 (Tenn. Feb. 26, 2013).

           Trial court did not err in holding that it was deprived of jurisdiction to consider any effort to reclaim an arrestee's forfeited property because he did not attempt to file a claim in the applicable agency and did not seek judicial review of the agency's decision within sixty days; the arrestee was required to file a claim with the Tennessee Department of Safety to contest the forfeiture because the property seized was “narcotics related,” but he failed to file any claim with the Department. Augustin v. Bradley Cty. Sheriff's Office, 598 S.W.3d 220, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 481 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2019), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 125 (Tenn. Feb. 19, 2020).

           Arrestees allegations, taken as true, indicated that the notice provided to him could have been ineffective because while the arrestee was residing in the county jail, the relevant documents were sent to addresses in North Carolina; however, the alleged lack of notice did not change the administrative procedures applicable to the arrestee's effort to contest the forfeiture. Augustin v. Bradley Cty. Sheriff's Office, 598 S.W.3d 220, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 481 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2019), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 125 (Tenn. Feb. 19, 2020).

           Co-owner of a mobile home lacked standing to contest the forfeiture of currency that was properly seized as proceeds from drug trafficking during a search of the mobile home, which was leased to the co-owner's adult child, because the co-owner failed to demonstrate an ownership interest in the currency. The trial court's application of an incorrect standard of review was harmless error as, under the correct standard of review, the evidence preponderated in favor of the administrative law judge's determination that the co-owner lacked standing.
