        Granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim was not error in a partnership liability action against an owner based on the death of a young woman who purchased illegal drugs and alcohol at the owner's residence, because a co-owner's use of the house for the sale of illegal drugs and alcohol was not for the purpose of or in the furtherance of a partnership with another co-owner. Concklin v. Holland, 138 S.W.3d 215, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 934 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 515 (Tenn. June 1, 2004).

        It was undisputed in the record that the parties' relationship constituted a partnership, as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite>, and, as such, the trial court correctly applied the Tennessee Uniform Partnership Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite> et seq. Because the undisputed proof indicated that the contractor left the project before it was completed, a preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the contractor breached the partnership agreement and wrongfully dissociated from the partnership pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-601" target="_self">61-1-601</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-602ol1b" target="_self">61-1-602(b)</a></cite>. Moran v. Willensky, 339 S.W.3d 651, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 80 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 2, 2010), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 855 (Tenn. Sept. 1, 2010).

        The fact that a father informed the father's daughter that the children had an “interest” in an alleged partnership was insufficient to form a partnership. Tanner v. Whiteco, L.P., 337 S.W.3d 792, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 337 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 17, 2010), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 1130 (Tenn. Nov. 18, 2010).

        Court properly found that funds were partnership funds where, contrary to defendant's assertions, simply because a piece of property was titled only in his name did not mean that partnership funds were not used to purchase that property or that it was not partnership property. Any initial investment clearly consisted of partnership assets and defendant could not claim any individual entitlement to the funds. Montgomery v. Montgomery, 181 S.W.3d 720, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 151 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 982 (Tenn. Oct. 31, 2005).

        Court properly found that a cohabiting couple were equal partners where plaintiff handled the payroll account, paid the bills and signed all of the checks for the business, prepared the 1099's, handled the workers' compensation insurance, filed documents with the IRS including tax returns, handled the book keeping, made the deposits, collected the debts, and placed orders and handled the invoices. The court also found that plaintiff never received any wages or a salary for her work in the masonry business. Montgomery v. Montgomery, 181 S.W.3d 720, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 151 (Tenn. Ct.

        Dismissal of the decedent's daughter's ex-husband's and grandchildren's action against the decedent's sole surviving child to invalidate the decedent's will was appropriate pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite> because the ex-husband testified that he converted a corporation to a sole proprietorship, and that he owned all of it, and there was also no evidence that the decedent participated in any business decisions; thus, there was nothing sufficient to establish an implied partnership between the decedent and her daughter's ex-husband or that the decedent's assets were assets of any partnership.

        Plaintiff corporation's motion to strike defendant's affirmative defense of breach of fiduciary duty was granted because even if the court concluded that the corporation's sole member had a fiduciary duty to defendant, that duty would not be shared by the corporation. Because the facts alleged did not show that the corporation and defendant shared money, assets, labor, or skill, there was no basis for concluding that the corporation had a fiduciary duty to defendant; even if the court found a duty, a breach of that duty would not necessarily relieve defendant of liability under promissory notes and therefore would not constitute an affirmative defense.

        Contractor's spouse was not liable in the spouse's individual capacity for construction defects when home buyers obtained a judgment against a construction company for breach of contract and against the estate of the contractor and the contractor's construction company for breach of implied warranty of workmanship because there was not a written partnership agreement and the contractor's spouse was not made an express partner or an implied partner through the spouse's involvement in the transaction.

         Revised Uniform Partnership Act does not preclude an existence of implied partnerships, and the statute provides that unless displaced by provisions of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act, the principles of law and equity supplement this chapter; as such, the common law principles of law and equity still apply concerning whether an implied partnership has been formed. This was certainly so when plaintiffs in this case alleged and submitted evidence that the implied partnership came into existence prior to the adoption of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.

         Provision that unless contrary intention appears, property acquired with partnership funds is partnership property, did not change the rule that real estate of partnership is held as personalty for partnership purposes, but where not needed for such purposes descends as other real estate to the heir. Marks v. Marks, 1 Tenn. App. 436, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 64 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that partners invest firm profits in real estate does not necessarily make it partnership property. Marks v. Marks, 1 Tenn. App. 436, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 64 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).
        </p>
        <p>
         The partnership may hold property in the partnership name and the interest of the individual members is personal property. Karns v. Loftis, 1 Tenn. App. 574, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a partnership acquires land solely for the purpose of speculation and it is not contemplated that there shall be any conveyances between the parties, equity regards it as personal property among the partners and an agreement of one partner to release his interest is not a contract for such an interest in lands as comes within the statute of frauds. Smith v. Guy, 24 Tenn. App. 352, 144 S.W.2d 702, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 41 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         When a partnership once acquires real estate, with partnership funds and for partnership purposes, it then becomes personalty for all purposes and can be conveyed according to the terms of the act as other partnership property. And real estate which becomes personal property for the purposes of a partnership remains personal property for the purpose of distribution. Cultra v. Cultra, 188 Tenn. 506, 221 S.W.2d 533, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 367 (1949).
        </p>
        <p>
         Partnership realty must be regarded as personalty for all purposes including descent and distribution. Brown v. Brown, 45 Tenn. App. 78, 320 S.W.2d 721, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 114 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).

         A conveyance of partnership property held in the name of the partnership is made in the name of the partnership and not as a conveyance of the individual interests of the partners. Putnam v. Shoaf, 620 S.W.2d 510, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 608 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         Partner had no specific interest in unknown choses in action of partnership to separately convey or retain since it was property of the partnership, thus when the partner conveyed an interest in the partnership that partner retained no rights in the chose in action upon its discovery. Putnam v. Shoaf, 620 S.W.2d 510, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 608 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).

         In determining whether property is partnership property or property owned by an individual, the court must focus primarily on the intentions of the partners at the time the property was acquired. In re Fulton, 43 B.R. 273, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4900 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1984).
        </p>

         Proceeds from equipment purchased before the partnership was dissolved, were partnership property. In re Henderson, 127 B.R. 168, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6284 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).
        </p>

         Inventory proceeds which were turnover of inventory that was in stock when the partnership was dissolved were partnership property. In re Henderson, 127 B.R. 168, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6284 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).

          A person holding himself out as a partner, thereby inducing another to extend credit to third party upon faith of such representation, is liable upon the doctrine of estoppel. H. T. Hackney Co. v. Robert E. Lee Hotel, 156 Tenn. 243, 300 S.W. 1, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 108 (1927).

          In an action by plaintiff against the defendants as partners to recover damages for diseased hogs delivered to him by one defendant, the other defendant denied the act to be a partnership act and the charge of the judge that, “if the defendants were partners and plaintiff knew of the partnership and had recently dealt with them as partners in similar transactions, and you find that he, as a reasonably prudent man had a right to think that he was dealing with the partnership, then the defendants would be liable as partners even if as between themselves it was not a partnership act,” was a correct statement of the law. Tallent v. Fox, 24 Tenn. App. 96, 141 S.W.2d 485, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 19 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).

           Since all partners have equal rights in the conduct and management of a firm's business affairs, the value of a deceased partner's interest when sold to a surviving partner was not enhanced by the fact that it gave the purchaser 80% ownership of the firm. Reed v. Robilio, 273 F. Supp. 954, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11410 (W.D. Tenn. 1967), aff'd, 400 F.2d 730, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 5520 (6th Cir. 1968).

             It was undisputed in the record that the parties' relationship constituted a partnership, as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite>, and, as such, the trial court correctly applied the former Tennessee Uniform Partnership Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite> et seq. Because the undisputed proof indicated that the contractor left the project before it was completed, a preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the contractor breached the partnership agreement and wrongfully dissociated from the partnership pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-601" target="_self">61-1-601</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-602ol1b" target="_self">61-1-602(b)</a></cite>.

             Partnership could not terminate after dissolution where there had been no formal winding up period because the investors knew nothing of the termination, and where creditor's claim had not been paid out of the proceeds of the liquidated partnership property.

             The filing of a lawsuit seeking dissolution does not necessarily effect a dissolution upon the filing of the cause, and where the court determines that dissolution is proper, an order of dissolution should be entered; but such an order is not absolutely necessary where all partners agree that dissolution be effected.

             It was undisputed in the record that the parties' relationship constituted a partnership, as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite>, and, as such, the trial court correctly applied the former Tennessee Uniform Partnership Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-101" target="_self">61-1-101</a></cite> et seq. Because the undisputed proof indicated that the contractor left the project before it was completed, a preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the contractor breached the partnership agreement and wrongfully dissociated from the partnership pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-601" target="_self">61-1-601</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-602ol1b" target="_self">61-1-602(b)</a></cite>.

              Although upon withdrawal of one or more partners, the partnership may allow the business to continue in the same name with the withdrawing partners being compensated for their interest in the business, nevertheless the first or terminated partnership is a different business association from the partnership or other entity that operates the continuing business. Hodge v. DMNS Co., 652 S.W.2d 762, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 455 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

              The withdrawal of two partners from a partnership, while the business was continued in lieu of liquidation, did not amount to a “sale or transfer by the borrower” of the property held by the partnership for purposes of a “due-on-sale” clause, even though by operation of law the entity had changed. Hodge v. DMNS Co., 652 S.W.2d 762, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 455 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

              Investors in a partnership did not lose their standing as partnership creditors when one partner assigned his interest to another, but became creditors of the continuing entity. In re Henderson, 127 B.R. 168, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6284 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).

               In winding up a partnership's business, the assets of the partnership, including the contributions of the partners required by this section, must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including, to the extent permitted by law, partners who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (b).

               Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts upon winding up the partnership business. In settling accounts among the partners, the profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets must be credited and charged to the partners' accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the charges in the partner's account. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner's account, but exclude from the calculation charges attributable to an obligation for which the partner is not personally liable under § 61-1-306.

A partner or partner's legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner's share of the partnership obligations for which the partner is personally liable under § 61-1-306.

               Trial court did not err in distributing some of a dairy partnership's assets before the actual winding up of the partnership and payment of its debts because the trial court clearly intended for the parties to proceed with winding up the partnership business under its supervision in accordance with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t61c01s61-1-807" target="_self">61-1-807</a></cite>; the trial court intended that any debts of the partnership would be paid first, as a part of the winding up, and as a part of the winding up, when all of the assets were sold and any legitimate partnership debts were paid, the estate would receive a credit for its share of the partnership bank account, Swecker v.

        A failure to comply with the statutory requirements for establishing a limited partnership, such as recording, does not void the creation of an association between the partners, but does preclude those partners from claiming the status of limited partners when dealing with third parties who are without notice of the limited liability due to a failure to record.

Bush (In re Taylor &amp; Assocs., L.P.), 249 B.R. 431, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23765 (E.D. Tenn. 1997).

           2. Evidence of Limited Partnership.
          </span>
         </h4>
         <p>
          Evidence supporting the existence of a limited partnership included a filed certificate, an EIN, a bank account, correspondence, billing records, checks and a pervasive use of the putative limited partnership's name. Taylor v. Bush (In re Taylor & Assocs., L.P.), 249 B.R. 431, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23765 (E.D. Tenn. 1997).
         </p>
         <p>
          Although there was evidence supporting the existence of a limited partnership, circumstantial evidence of a limited partnership does not ipso facto create a limited partnership. Taylor v. Bush (In re Taylor & Assocs., L.P.), 249 B.R. 431, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23765 (E.D. Tenn. 1997).
         </p>
         <p>
          All signs and steps of a limited partnership must form a straight line and the presence of statutory prerequisites is mandatory evidence to support the existence of a limited partnership. Taylor v. Bush (In re Taylor & Assocs., L.P.), 249 B.R. 431, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23765 (E.D. Tenn. 1997).

            Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner is obligated to the limited partnership to perform any promise to contribute cash or property or to perform services, even if he is unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a partner does not make the required contribution of property or services, he is obligated at the option of the limited partnership to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value (as stated in the records of the limited partnership) of the contribution that has not been made. The foregoing option shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the limited partnership may have against such partner under the partnership agreement or applicable law.
           </li>
           <li id="t61c02s61-2-502ol1b">
            Unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, the obligation of a partner to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this chapter may be compromised only by consent of all the partners. Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited partnership who extends credit after the entering into of a partnership agreement or an amendment thereto which, in either case, reflects the obligation, and before the amendment thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a partner to make a contribution or return. A conditional obligation of a partner to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited partnership may not be enforced unless the conditions to the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such partner. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited partnership or a general partner prior to the time the call occurs.

             On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partnership interest. This chapter does not deprive any partner of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to his partnership interest.

The secretary of state shall endorse the time of receipt upon the original and copy and shall immediately send the copy, along with a written notice that service of the original was also made, by registered or certified mail, with return receipt requested, addressed to the limited partnership at its registered office or principal office, or designated alternative mailing address, as shown in the records on file in the secretary of state's office or as shown in the official registry of the state or country in which the limited partnership is formed. If none of the addresses described in the previous sentence are available to the secretary of state, service may be made to any one (1) of the general partners at the address set forth in the certificate of limited partnership.
