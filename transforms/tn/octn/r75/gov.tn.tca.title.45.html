        A person who is aggrieved by an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to § 45-1-107 is entitled to judicial review as provided in the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5. A person who is aggrieved and directly affected by an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to other provisions of this title may seek judicial review as provided in title 27, chapter 9, except that judicial review of orders issued pursuant to chapter 5 of this title shall be governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act.

The maximum aggregate civil penalty assessed against a bank and any other person participating in the violation, however, shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per day for each proceeding. In determining the amount of the penalty, the commissioner shall consider the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the financial resources and good faith of the person charged, the gravity of the violation, and other matters that justice may require. The person shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing upon request made within ten (10) days of the issuance of the notice of assessment. The commissioner's decision after a hearing or otherwise shall constitute a final order and may be reviewed in accordance with subsection (a); provided, that the original order shall not be reviewable in a proceeding initiated under this subsection (c).

        The taking emergency possession of a trust company by the commissioner of the Tennessee department of financial institutions was proper where there was a $7 million deficit, and there was ample evidence that the company was being run in unsound manner, because the legislature's intent to bring state trust companies under the umbrella of the Tennessee Banking Act is clear from the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory language of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c01s45-1-124ol1b" target="_self">45-1-124(b)</a></cite> and (d); therefore, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c02s45-2-1502" target="_self">45-2-1502</a></cite>, that authorizes the commissioner to take possession of a state bank under certain circumstances, also vests in the commissioner the full authority to take possession of a Tennessee trust company under the same set of circumstances.

         The provision of the former statute for approval of the bond required to be executed for protection of the deposit of state funds, and the provision for issuance of a permit to the trust company to do a general banking business, were designed for the protection of the depositors, and could not be converted into a shield to protect the trust company from liability.

         The abuse of corporate power by a trust company by failing to obtain a permit from the (former) state superintendent of banking to do a general banking business, prior to receiving a deposit from the state, did not render the transaction ultra vires, in view of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c02s45-2-1707" target="_self">45-2-1707</a></cite> where its charter conferred upon it the power.

        </p>
        <p>
         Even if a transaction whereby the state deposited a sum of money with a trust company was ultra vires, because the trust company had not received a permit from the state superintendent of banking to do a general banking business, the defense was not available to the trust company so long as it retained the benefits received by the transaction. State v. Holston Trust Co., 168 Tenn. 546, 79 S.W.2d 1012, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1934).

        <p>
         Where state officials were dealing with a trust company in a transaction relating to deposit of state funds, and it appeared from the trust company's charter that it had full power to do a general banking business, including reception of deposits, the state was not chargeable with notice that the trust company had failed to obtain from the (former) superintendent of banking a permit to do a general banking business, as affecting the right of recovery. State v. Holston Trust Co., 168 Tenn. 546, 79 S.W.2d 1012, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1934).

Permitting a national bank to branch statewide merely creates a level playing field for nationally chartered banks and further enhances competition in the financial industry. Volunteer State Bank v.

The commissioner may establish by rule additional types of agency transactions, the performance of which shall not cause the agent bank to be deemed a branch of the principal bank.

             Federally chartered savings and loans have engaged in statewide branching in Tennessee because, under the “wild card” statute, they may do as state chartered savings banks may do. Permitting a national bank to branch statewide merely creates a level playing field for nationally chartered banks and further enhances competition in the financial industry. Volunteer State Bank v.

              This statute applies to joint accounts even where the account is not a joint survivorship account. Simmons v. Foster, 622 S.W.2d 838, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 542 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).

              T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c02s45-2-703" target="_self">45-2-703</a></cite> directs banks to use a certain type of document when opening or amending a deposit account. The reference is obviously to the signature card that is ordinarily used by banks for accounts subject to withdrawals. The section does not apply to certificates of deposit that require no signature card and provide no withdrawal until maturity. Roberts v. Roberts, 827 S.W.2d 788, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 834 (Tenn. Ct.

             </p>

              The comma after “either” and the word “or” seem to indicate that if the account is payable to either party, or to either party or survivor that the bank is protected if it pays the funds to the survivor.

              During the lifetime of joint tenants (other than husband and wife), with right of survivorship, the funds deposited in the an account are held in divisible parts and, upon the death of one, the other takes the whole only by survivorship. Leffew v. Mayes, 685 S.W.2d 288, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3055 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

              This section does not indicate any legislative intent to abolish tenancy by the entirety in bank deposits held by spouses or to convert the accounts into some other form of ownership merely because they are payable to either or subject to individual checking or withdrawal. Griffin v. Prince, 632 S.W.2d 532, 1982 Tenn. LEXIS 402 (Tenn. 1982).

             <p>
              The 1983 amendment, which relieved the depository bank of the responsibility to resist a third party's claim to an account, did not abolish tenancy by the entirety. Edwards v. Edwards, 713 S.W.2d 642, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 834 (Tenn. 1986), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">479 U.S. 1024</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 863</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">93 L.

              When a party to a joint bank account (not husband and wife) with a right of survivorship has, during the lifetime of the parties to the joint account, filed a lawsuit alleging that he put about one-half of the money into the account and prayed that one-half thereof be adjudged to him (the other party by intervening petition alleged that the original plaintiff had not paid any amount into the joint account and prayed that the certificate be delivered to him) and, while suit is pending, the other party to the joint account dies, the plaintiff may not amend the complaint and enforce a claim for the entire fund that the survivor. The joint tenants having differed on the ownership of the funds and having, during their lifetime, brought suit to establish their respective interest therein, the ownership of the funds must be determined in that lawsuit, even though one claimant died while the suit was pending.

              Where funds are on deposit in a joint account with right of survivorship, during the lifetime of the joint tenants a rebuttable presumption arises that the parties own the money on deposit equally. Leffew v. Mayes, 685 S.W.2d 288, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3055 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984); Knight v. Lancaster, 988 S.W.2d 172, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 483 (Tenn. Ct.

             <p>
              Probate court properly ruled that a caretaker acted in her capacity of attorney-in-fact during the transactions in question and that the transactions could be examined for undue influence, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion because the decedent's intent in establishing a bank account was to name the caretaker as an authorized signatory and not create a joint account, and the caretaker did not rebut the presumption of undue influence where her actions, including writing more than $2,000,000 worth of checks as the decedent's attorney-in-fact payable to herself, were inconsistent with the intent of the decedent's will and the notion that the transactions were fair and freely approved by the decedent.

              Because the origin of the decedent's surviving family members'  claim that the decedent's friend unduly influenced the decedent to close some of the decedent's bank accounts and to name the friend's spouse as the sole payable-on-death beneficiary on the remaining accounts did not change merely because the family members named the bank as a co-defendant, the undue influence claim arose from the common law, so that the issue of standing was not so interwoven with that of subject matter jurisdiction so as to be a jurisdictional prerequisite.

                Where a purchaser of a bond from a bank understood the bond was to be placed in her father's tin box in the bank's vault, but she relied on the promise of the bank president to take care of the bond for her, and he assured her that it would be safely kept, and he himself selected the father's box that the receptacle for the bond, the bank clearly became a bailee of the bond itself, and not a mere bailee of the father's box.

                Usage and custom in a particular business reflect on the care exacted of the bailee, but in an action against a bank to recover the value of a bond stolen from its vault by burglars, it was not competent to permit proof of what one or two other banks may or may not have done toward safeguarding their valuables, nor of the business policy of burglary insurance companies, nor of the advertisements of the bank, where the plaintiff relied wholly on the personal assurances from the bank president.

                Proof that a bank in a small town, that did not represent or advertise that its safe deposit boxes were burglar proof, did not employ any night watchmen, only kept electric lights burning in bank until approximately 11 o'clock p.m., did not equip the building with burglar alarm, and deposited its own securities in a screw door steel safe, does not show lack of ordinary care to protect the complainant's bonds deposited in safe deposit box from burglary, for the term “safe deposit box” is a trade-name, and it does not mean that the boxes are burglar proof. Young v. First Nat'l Bank, 150 Tenn. 451, 265 S.W. 681, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 20, <cite class="alr">40 A.L.R. 868</cite> (1924).

                 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this chapter and chapter 1 of this title or elsewhere, state banks have the power to make loans upon the same terms and at the maximum effective interest rates as loans are authorized and credit extended by national banks in this state. This power includes, but is not limited to, the right to take, receive, reserve and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any notes, bills of exchange, or other evidence of debt, interest at a maximum effective interest rate of one percent (1%) in excess of the discount rate on ninety-day commercial paper in effect at the federal reserve bank in the federal reserve district where the state bank is located.

                  It is the intent of the general assembly in adopting this part to allow financial service providers the discretion to take actions to assist in detecting and preventing financial exploitation without liability. The general assembly recognizes that financial service providers are in a unique position by conducting financial transactions on behalf of and at the request of their customers. Financial service providers have duties imposed by contract and duties imposed by both federal and state law to conduct financial transactions requested by their customers faithfully and timely in accordance with the customer's instructions. Further, financial service providers do not have a duty to contravene the valid instructions of their customers, nor to prevent criminal activity directed at their customers, and nothing in this part creates such a duty.

                      The purpose of the preference provision is to prevent dissolution or diminution of the fund held by the receiver for pro rata distribution to proven creditors and claimants. In re Liquidation of United Am. Bank, 743 S.W.2d 911, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1072 (Tenn. 1987).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Subdivision (d)(2) does not affect the statutory authority provided in other sections to make discretionary sales of assets with the approval of a court of competent jurisdiction; this reading of the preference section construes it in pari materia with the entire statutory scheme. In re Liquidation of United Am. Bank, 743 S.W.2d 911, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1072 (Tenn. 1987).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      An intent to create a preference could be inferred where no provision of a fund for ratable distribution to unassumed creditors or claimants was made. In re Liquidation of United Am. Bank, 743 S.W.2d 911, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1072 (Tenn. 1987).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      A purchase and assumption agreement that provides for assumption of all liabilities does not create a preference as a general rule. In re Liquidation of United Am. Bank, 743 S.W.2d 911, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1072 (Tenn. 1987).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If a pre-distribution purchase and assumption agreement, that is statutorily authorized as part of the conduct and administration of a receivership, provides for the disposition of losses, liabilities, and assets for a statutorily sanctioned purpose but the amount of the receivership fund available for distribution to any remaining proven, unassumed claimants is not thereby diminished, then a preference has not been created because nothing has been done to decrease the amount available for a pro rata distribution to satisfy the insolvent's liabilities. In re Liquidation of United Am. Bank, 743 S.W.2d 911, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1072 (Tenn. 1987).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      As long that the receiver takes the necessary steps to provide a fund for pro rata satisfaction of unassumed claims from an undiminished (or enhanced) fund, a purchase and assumption agreement that does not provide for assumption of all liabilities does not per se constitute a voidable or illegal preference under subdivision (d)(2). In re Liquidation of United Am. Bank, 743 S.W.2d 911, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1072 (Tenn. 1987).

                        A former similar statute was enacted for the protection of depositors and creditors, and to declare void a note given by a stockholder to the bank upon security of capital stock belonging to the borrowers would defeat the purpose of the statute and enable officers and stockholders of a failing bank to secure to themselves its funds with no fear of punishment except that meted out to misdemeanants.

        Federally chartered savings and loans have engaged in statewide branching in Tennessee because, under the “wild card” statute, they may do as state chartered savings banks may do. Permitting a national bank to branch statewide merely creates a level playing field for nationally chartered banks and further enhances competition in the financial industry. Volunteer State Bank v.

      </h3>
      <p>
       An association may issue the shares of capital stock authorized by its charter and none other. The capital stock of an association, when issued, shall not be retired or withdrawn except as hereinafter provided until all liabilities of the association have been satisfied in full, including the withdrawal value of all deposit accounts. An association may issue shares of common stock and preferred stock, with or without par value, and the common and preferred stock may be divided into classes and the classes into series. Capital stock of an association shall be issued pursuant to the following requirements:

      <ol>
       <li id="t45c03s45-3-110ol11">
        Consideration for Issuance of Stock.  Except for stock issued pursuant to an employee stock option plan, or pursuant to a plan of merger, consolidation, conversion from a mutual to a stock association, or other type of reorganization that has been approved by the commissioner, the consideration for the issuance of capital stock shall be paid in cash and the par value or stated value thereof shall be maintained as the permanent capital of the association, and any excess shall be credited to paid-in surplus;

        Permanent Capital — Reduction and Retirement.  The aggregate par value or stated value of all outstanding shares of capital stock shall be the permanent capital of the association, and, except as otherwise specifically provided by this chapter, the capital stock shall not be retired until final liquidation of the association. No association shall reduce the par or stated value of its outstanding capital stock without first obtaining the written approval of the commissioner, and approval shall be withheld if the reduction will cause the par or stated value of outstanding capital stock to be less than the minimum required by this chapter, or will result in less than adequate net worth as the commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, determine. No association shall retire any part of its capital stock unless the retirement is approved by the commissioner. With the written approval of the commissioner, an association may purchase its capital stock from the personal representative of a deceased stockholder; and with the written approval, an association may contract with a living stockholder for the purchase upon the stockholder's death. The purchase shall be for a price, and upon terms and conditions, that are agreed upon by the association and the stockholder or personal representative; provided, that the purchase shall not reduce the net worth accounts of the association, or any of them, to an amount less than required by applicable law or by the approved insurer of the association's deposit accounts. An association agreeing with a stockholder to purchase that stockholder's capital stock upon the stockholder's death may purchase insurance upon the life of the stockholder to fund or partially fund the purchase. Any stock purchased from a decedent's personal representative may be resold by the association at the price, and upon terms and conditions, that the board of directors of the association approves or may be retired; provided, that prior to resale, notice shall be filed with the commissioner disclosing the price, terms, and conditions of the proposed resale.

          Federally chartered savings and loans have engaged in statewide branching in Tennessee because, under the “wild card” statute, they may do as state chartered savings banks may do. Permitting a national bank to branch statewide merely creates a level playing field for nationally chartered banks and further enhances competition in the financial industry. Volunteer State Bank v.

Each proposed amendment, together with a certified copy of the authorizing resolution, shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval. If the commissioner finds that the proposed amendment is in conformity with the law, the commissioner shall, in writing, approve the amendment and shall send notice of approval of the amendment by registered or certified mail to the home office of the association not less than thirty (30) days after its receipt by the commissioner. Should the commissioner disapprove any amendment within the time specified, the commissioner shall state the disapproval, together with the written reasons therefor, and send the same by registered or certified mail to the home office of the association, giving the association, if appropriate under the circumstances, the opportunity to modify or change and resubmit the proposed amendment so as to obviate the commissioner's objections. In the event that the commissioner disapproves the amendment after the resubmission by the association, the commissioner shall send written notice of the final disapproval by registered or certified mail to the home office of the association. Failure to send notice of approval or disapproval within the time specified shall be deemed to constitute approval of the proposed amendment by the commissioner.

In making a determination, the commissioner should consider the credit union's quality of management, capitalization, internal controls and any other factors the commissioner deems relevant. In no event may a credit union's examination cycle be extended to eighteen (18) months if it did not receive a composite rating of one (1) or two (2) at its last examination. The commissioner may order examinations and shall at all times be given free access to all the books, papers, securities and other sources of information in respect to the credit union. For that purpose, the commissioner shall have the power to subpoena and examine, personally or through a deputy duly authorized, witnesses on oath and documents pertaining to the business of the credit union. The commissioner may have follow-up examinations and visitations conducted on a credit union if the commissioner believes that the examinations and visitations are necessary to protect the interests of the members of the credit union.

          With respect to a loan by a national bank, a default interest rate of 24 percent was not usurious, because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c05s45-5-301ol12" target="_self">45-5-301(2)</a></cite> authorized industrial loan and thrift companies to charge this rate, and federal law authorized national banks to charge interest at rates allowed by the state where the banks were located.

          The former section concerning loan charges was unconstitutional prior to the 1978 amendment of Tenn. Const., art. XI, § 7, and void insofar as it was applied to any note or obligation, discounted at seven and one-half percent and payable in monthly installments, or to any other transaction, regardless of how payment was programmed, if the end result was an effective rate of interest in excess of 10 percent (10%).

          Where by terms of loan made pursuant to the former chapter, providing for the deduction of interest in advance and for monthly installments pursuant to note, debtor would have paid approximately 12 percent (12%) interest on amount of money of that he had used, loan was usurious as it exceeded constitutional maximum of 10 percent interest.

           T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c05s45-5-402" target="_self">45-5-402</a></cite> does not mandate the use of the Rule of 78 in rebating unmatured interest; rather, it establishes a minimum rebate to the borrower in the event of an authorized prepayment in full of an installment loan having an original term of five years or less. In re McMurray, 218 B.R. 867, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 297 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1998).
          </p>
          <p>
           Use of the Rule of 78 is inappropriate to calculate the payoff of a debt necessitated by the act of filing bankruptcy since a bankruptcy petition does not constitute a prepayment, and the Rule of 78 is an inaccurate approximation that imposes a payment penalty to the detriment of a bankruptcy debtor, the bankruptcy estate and creditors. In re McMurray, 218 B.R. 867, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 297 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1998).

         A licensed pawnbroker can lend money on the security of a motor vehicle while allowing the borrower to retain possession of his vehicle provided that the loan is not otherwise a “pawn” or “pawn transaction,” and the pawnbroker complies with other applicable laws. Lynn v. Financial Solutions Corp. (In re Lynn), 173 B.R. 894, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1669 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1994), amended, — B.R. —, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1916 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. Dec. 12, 1994).

         If a pawnbroker's loan of money on a vehicle was construed as a “loan on a pledge of any nature” and not a “pawn” or “pawn transaction,” then it would be governed by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code; therefore, where the pawnbroker failed to give proper notice of the sale of the vehicle, conducted a private sale unreasonable in its method, and received a grossly inadequate sale price, the sale of the repossessed vehicle was not conducted in a “commercially reasonable” manner.

         “Maturity” cannot be the date of execution of a pawn agreement, unless the agreement had called for immediate repayment or the pawnbroker had accelerated the loan upon a default on the same date. The “maturity of the loan” means when the loan becomes due by default and acceleration or by arrival of the due date as given on the face of the agreement; thus, failure of a pawnbroker to retain possession of pledged property for 50 days following the first date the pawnor failed to make a scheduled payment violated the requirements of this section.

       Appellate court rejected the corporate directors'  claims that the bank records admitted at trial were inaccurate or incomplete because the records were presented for admission through a records custodian affidavit, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c10s45-10-101" target="_self">45-10-101</a></cite> et seq., that required that the records custodian's affidavit be admissible in evidence and the matters stated therein be presumed true in the absence of a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. There was no indication that the directors were denied an opportunity to subpoena the records custodian to testify on their behalf, nor wthat there any indication that the directors attempted to conduct their own discovery regarding the bank records; rather when asked about the bank records, one director testified that there was no basis to believe the records were distorted.

      <p>
       The origination or offering of financing for residential real property has a direct, valuable and immediate impact upon Tennessee's consumers, Tennessee's economy, the neighborhoods and communities of this state and the housing and real estate industry. The general assembly finds that accessibility to mortgage credit is vital to the state's citizens. It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure a sound system of making residential mortgage loans through the licensing, examination and regulation of mortgage lenders, mortgage loan brokers, mortgage loan servicers and mortgage loan originators. It is also the purpose of this chapter to carry out the purposes and to be compliant with the requirements of the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (<cite class="us_code">12 U.S.C. § 5101</cite> et seq.).

          No mortgage loan originator license issued under this part is considered active unless the individual has also been sponsored by a licensed mortgage lender or mortgage loan broker or by a registrant in accordance with the Industrial Loan and Thrift Companies Act, compiled in chapter 5 of this title. A mortgage loan originator is prohibited from providing origination services with an inactive license. No mortgage loan originator may be sponsored by more than one (1) person at the same time, and the provision of origination services for a person that has not properly sponsored the mortgage loan originator shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Subsections (b)-(e) shall not apply to a mortgage loan originator that is properly sponsored by a registrant under the Industrial Loan and Thrift Companies Act.

          To sponsor a mortgage loan originator, a mortgage lender or mortgage loan broker must file with the commissioner the form that the commissioner prescribes and pay to the commissioner a nonrefundable sponsorship fee of one hundred dollars ($100), which fee may be decreased or increased by rule of the commissioner. Upon determining that the individual is duly licensed and not sponsored by any other person, the commissioner shall authorize the sponsorship, which may be done electronically or in writing, or both. A mortgage loan originator sponsorship terminates if the sponsoring mortgage lender or mortgage loan broker's license expires or is revoked or otherwise terminates or if the mortgage loan originator ceases providing services for such company. A mortgage loan originator sponsorship does not terminate if the mortgage loan originator changes from one (1) branch office of the sponsoring mortgage lender or mortgage loan broker to another branch office of the same company. Upon any change in the mortgage loan originator's office, the sponsoring mortgage lender or mortgage loan broker shall notify the commissioner in writing within fourteen (14) days of the change.

          Should a mortgage loan originator sponsorship terminate, the mortgage loan originator's license shall become inactive, but shall not expire so long as the mortgage loan originator continues to meet the requirements for licensure and renewal of licensure. An inactive license is reactivated if the mortgage loan originator obtains a new sponsorship under this section or under the Industrial Loan and Thrift Companies Act. The commissioner may not approve a new sponsorship unless and until the commissioner has been notified that any prior sponsorship has terminated.

The mortgage lender or mortgage loan broker shall also ensure that its records pertaining to the residential mortgage loan contain the unique identifier, if different from the license number, of each mortgage loan originator that provided services with respect to the loan.

         Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or the Industrial Loan and Thrift Companies Act, compiled in chapter 5 of this title, to the contrary, the commissioner is authorized to issue a provisional mortgage loan originator license to any individual who has not completed the prelicensing education requirements set forth in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-304" target="_self">45-13-304</a></cite> or passed a written test that meets the test requirement described in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-305" target="_self">45-13-305</a></cite>; provided, that the individual meets all other requirements for a license under this part; and provided, further, that no provisional mortgage loan originator license shall be issued after or be valid after July 30, 2010. A provisional mortgage loan originator license shall for all purposes be considered a mortgage loan originator license issued under this part, except that a provisional license shall expire on July 30, 2010, unless the individual holding the license has by such date, completed the prelicensing education requirements set forth in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-304" target="_self">45-13-304</a></cite> and passed a written test that meets the test requirement described in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-305" target="_self">45-13-305</a></cite>. If these education requirements are timely accomplished, and so long as the individual has furnished fingerprints to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry if requested to do so under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-302ol1f" target="_self">45-13-302(f)</a></cite>, the provisional nature of the license shall be removed, and the license shall not expire until the end of the calendar year in which the last of all the requirements have been met. Subject to the July 30, 2010, expiration date, a provisional mortgage loan originator license issued in 2009 may be renewed for 2010 pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-306" target="_self">45-13-306</a></cite> without satisfying the annual continuing education requirements described in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t45c13s45-13-307" target="_self">45-13-307</a></cite>.
