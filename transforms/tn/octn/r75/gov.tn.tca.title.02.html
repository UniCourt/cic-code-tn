       The general rule is that only a substantial compliance, rather than a strictly literal compliance, with the election laws is required, so that, absent proof of fraud, the court would not hold illegal either the ballots of persons who merely voted in the wrong city precinct or the ballots of women who had married since their prior registration and who had simply failed to report a change of name; but where there were more than five clearly illegal ballots cast in an election because of the improper and unauthorized late registration of voters who had not previously registered to vote in municipal elections, those were not minor or technical violations but rather violations of major and important statutory provisions governing the registration of voters, so that the election was held void and a new election ordered. Lanier v. Revell, 605 S.W.2d 821, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (Tenn. 1980).

      <p>
       Although fact that the chair of a county election commission was the campaign manager for the successful candidate for mayor was not a direct violation of the election laws, it created an appearance of impropriety which aroused suspicion and distrust of the administration of the election laws and was, at a minimum, ill-advised. Lanier v. Revell, 605 S.W.2d 821, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (Tenn. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       County election commission erred by refusing to place an ordinance on the ballot, as the commission's duties were ministerial and, thus, it did not have the authority to determine whether the proposed ordinance would have been constitutional had the measure passed.

   Trial court acted without jurisdiction in a case brought by a mayor by entering an injunction against an election commission precluding a recall election because the commission was entitled to make a final determination regarding the issues surrounding the recall ballot before judicial review; under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c09s27-9-101" target="_blank">27-9-101</a></cite>, judicial review was available as to final orders. The commission was preempted by the trial court's injunction from meeting and engaging in the statutorily prescribed ministerial duties required of it to make final decisions regarding the recall ballot.

      Attorney General Opinions. Election officials are bound by law to use the title “county mayors” and not “county executives” on primary and general election ballots for that office after July 1, 2003, OAG 03-096 (8/13/03).

      Although the Tennessee Constitution does not prohibit persons under the age of 18 from voting in municipal elections, current Tennessee law prohibits persons under the age of 18 from voting in municipal elections. A municipality’s home rule status has no effect on the application of the suffrage clause to municipal elections or on the ability of the legislature to establish a statewide age requirement for voters. Accordingly, under current law, a municipality may not allow any person under the age of 18 to vote in a municipal election, regardless of whether the municipality has adopted home rule.

      Although the Tennessee Constitution does not prohibit persons under the age of 18 from voting in municipal elections, current Tennessee law prohibits persons under the age of 18 from voting in municipal elections. A municipality’s home rule status has no effect on the application of the suffrage clause to municipal elections or on the ability of the legislature to establish a statewide age requirement for voters. Accordingly, under current law, a municipality may not allow any person under the age of 18 to vote in a municipal election, regardless of whether the municipality has adopted home rule.

       Tennessee's requirement that minor or new political parties file an affidavit stating that the party does not advocate overthrow of the government by force or violence before the party's nominees could be placed on the ballot violates the First Amendment, as loyalty oaths are unconstitutional; however, the requirement that the party's rules of operation be filed with the Tennessee Secretary of State is unrelated to the loyalty oath requirement.

        The general rule is that only a substantial compliance, rather than a strictly literal compliance, with the election laws is required, so that, absent proof of fraud, the court would not hold illegal either the ballots of persons who merely voted in the wrong city precinct or the ballots of women who had married since their prior registration and who had simply failed to report a change of name; but where there were more than five clearly illegal ballots cast in an election because of the improper and unauthorized late registration of voters who had not previously registered to vote in municipal elections, those were not minor or technical violations but rather violations of major and important statutory provisions governing the registration of voters, so that the election was held void and a new election ordered.

   The Tennessee coordinator of elections and secretary of state interpret this section to require that citizens disclose their social security number as a pre-condition to voter registration. This requirement does not infringe upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion because a state law that is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose will be upheld against a free exercise claim, even in a “hybrid” situation involving other fundamental rights such as voting, so long as the law is generally applicable, not aimed at particular religious practices and free of a system of particularized exceptions.

        Under the statutes, after having one's rights of citizenship restored, the person must be deemed eligible to apply for a voter registration card, with the determination of eligibility to be made by the state election coordinator and communicated to the administrator of elections at the county election commission; in this case, there was no allegation that this procedure was not followed and plaintiff did not allege facts relative to any effort he made to apply for a voter card, and the complaint was insufficient to state a claim for relief.

       Acts 2013, ch. 372, §§ 1, 2 purported to amend subsection (a) of  this section. However, it was determined that Senate Bill No. 1320 and House Bill 1208, assigned as Public Chapter No. 372, did not pass both houses in the same form, as required by Tenn. Const., art. II, § 18 and, therefore, the act was not codified. The section set out above does not reflect the amendments by that act.

        Where the election commission did not follow the statutory provisions for publishing the changed boundaries and notifying voters whose polling places were changed, but instead, since the polling places were changed only for municipal elections, undertook to have each voter fill out a duplicate set of registration forms, and this procedure was not completed prior to the expiration of the regular registration period, and the commission concluded to permit the so-called “re-registration” of city voters to continue through the date of the election, with the result that a number of voters apparently were permitted to vote in the wrong precinct, and there were numerous other technical violations of the general election laws, nonetheless the violations were held to be minor in nature and not such as would render the ballots of the voters illegal or result in voiding the election. Lanier v. Revell, 605 S.W.2d 821, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (Tenn. 1980).

        The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) Prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) Ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. However, not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
       </p>

        Courts should be appropriately reluctant to take the step of declaring an election invalid. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

       <p>
        If complaint had been properly drawn, the purging by the trial court of a specific number of paper ballots in a particular precinct might well have been appropriate. But in the complaint, the contestant failed to demonstrate that a purge of those ballots would have changed the result of the election or rendered its outcome uncertain. Therefore, the court had no choice but to conclude that the chancellor correctly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
       </p>

        The allegations of the complaint were insufficient to show, district-wide, that election was so permeated by fraud or illegality as to render the results incurably uncertain or to thwart the will of the electorate. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

         Permitting voting prior to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November does not conflict with federal enactments because the final selection is not made before the federal election day; without the final selection, the winning candidate is not elected. Millsaps v. Thompson, 96 F. Supp. 2d 720, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5768 (E.D. Tenn. 2000), aff'd, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

        <p>
         Under the Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS), the combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder occur only on federal election day as required by federal law. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

        <p>
         The Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS) presents no obstacle to accomplishing the goals of the federal election day statutes; Tennessee's effort to increase voter participation does not conflict with, and is therefore not preempted by, the federal laws designating federal election day.

        In a case in which the Tennessee Democratic Party (TNDP) filed a complaint for declaratory injunctive relief that a Republican candidate should not appear on the ballot for House District 26, the requests for injunctive relief were moot as the actions sought to be enjoined had occurred, and the request for declaratory judgment was moot as the Republican candidate was listed on the ballot and subsequently elected; and none of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine were present because the TNDP's challenge was to the timeliness of the Republican candidate's qualifying as a candidate, given the original candidate's withdrawal after the qualifying deadline; and it did not involve the structural integrity of the election itself or the results.

         Without question, the commission and the coordinator have certain statutorily prescribed ministerial duties that allow, indeed require, them to do such things as examine ballot initiatives to determine whether signature requirements are met, determine whether submissions are timely, and determine whether candidates have properly qualified to be placed on the ballot; however, these statutes do not require or even permit the commission to refuse to include a referendum question on the ballot because the commission believes the question to be substantively unconstitutional. Determining the substantive constitutionality of such measures is a function reserved for the judicial branch of government City of Memphis v. Shelby County Election Comm'n, 146 S.W.3d 531, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 802 (Tenn. 2004).

        Early voting does not conflict with federal enactments because the final selection is not made before the federal election day; without the final selection, the winning candidate is not elected. Millsaps v. Thompson, 96 F. Supp. 2d 720, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5768 (E.D. Tenn. 2000), aff'd, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

        Under the Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS), the combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder occur only on federal election day as required by federal law. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

        The Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS) presents no obstacle to accomplishing the goals of the federal election day statutes; Tennessee's effort to increase voter participation does not conflict with, and is therefore not preempted by, the federal laws designating federal election day.

   Judgment declaring the candidate's opponent the winner of the election was affirmed in accordance with T.R.A.P. 24(c) because the appellate court must presume that the evidence supported the trial court's findings and ultimate conclusion that the candidate had not proven that the two votes were illegal such that a new election should be ordered; in order for the candidate to prove that there were two illegal votes, he must demonstrate that the two voters voted by paper ballot when all others voters voted by machine, and that these two voters did not use a paper ballot because they were in need of assistance pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-116" target="_self">2-7-116</a></cite>.

        Under the Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS), the combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder occur only on federal election day as required by federal law. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

       <p>
        The Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS) presents no obstacle to accomplishing the goals of the federal election day statutes; Tennessee's effort to increase voter participation does not conflict with, and is therefore not preempted by, the federal laws designating federal election day. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

         Provisions of this section expressly prohibiting incarcerated persons from utilizing the absentee ballot denied those incarcerated persons who had not been convicted of an infamous crime and who were otherwise entitled to vote equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution.

   In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the Tennessee Voter Identification Act (the Act), T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-112ol1a1B" target="_self">2-7-112(a)(1)(B)</a></cite>, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that the photo identification (ID) requirement is a logical method of protecting the integrity of elections by combating voter fraud and that requiring a person to provide government-issued photo ID is a practical, narrowly tailored means for the State to guard against the risk of voter impersonation. City of Memphis v. Hargett, 414 S.W.3d 88, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 779 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2013), substituted opinion, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 1101 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2013).

   Registered voters without special vulnerability to COVID-19 were unlikely to succeed on their claims that the State's construction of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c06s2-6-201ol15C" target="_self">2-6-201(5)(C)</a></cite> and (D) violated Tenn. Const. art. 1, § 5, where the burden on the right to vote was moderate given that the risk for in-person voting was significantly less than for those vulnerable to the virus, and when weighed against the State's interests in voter fraud prevention, fiscal responsibility, and feasibility, the moderate burden placed on the right to vote was justified. Fisher v. Hargett, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 283 (Tenn. Aug. 5, 2020).

         Under the Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS), the combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder occur only on federal election day as required by federal law. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

        <p>
         The Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS) presents no obstacle to accomplishing the goals of the federal election day statutes; Tennessee's effort to increase voter participation does not conflict with, and is therefore not preempted by, the federal laws designating federal election day. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

         The provisions for absentee voting must be strictly observed. Lanier v. Revell, 605 S.W.2d 821, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (Tenn. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         In determining how strictly absentee ballot provisions should be construed, court looked to extrinsic evidence to support applications for absentee ballots, and held technical omission did not invalidate the ballots where deputy compared the signatures on the applications, found them to be the same, yet failed to so indicate on the application; the procedural safeguard was not the marking on the application but the comparing of signatures, and this had been done. Foust v. May, 660 S.W.2d 487, 1983 Tenn. LEXIS 724 (Tenn. 1983).

         Violation of the absentee voting statutes presents the opportunity for fraud, whether committed or intended and where there is proof of actual fraud only, or a violation of statutory safeguards only, or a combination of the two, the issue is whether or not those acts, viewed cumulatively, compel the conclusion that the election did not express the free and fair will of the qualified voters.

         Under the Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS), the combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder occur only on federal election day as required by federal law designating federal election day. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

         The Tennessee Early Voting System (TEVS) presents no obstacle to accomplishing the goals of the federal election day statutes; Tennessee's effort to increase voter participation does not conflict with, and is therefore not preempted by, the federal laws designating federal election day. Millsaps v. Thompson, 259 F.3d 535, 2001 FED App. 256P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 17260 (6th Cir. 2001).

         In determining how strictly absentee ballot provisions should be construed, court looked to extrinsic evidence to support applications for absentee ballots, and held technical omission did not invalidate the ballots where deputy compared the signatures on the applications, found them to be the same, yet failed to so indicate on the application; the procedural safeguard was not the marking on the application but the comparing of signatures, and this had been done.

          The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) Prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) Ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. But not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

          Courts should be appropriately reluctant to take the step of declaring an election invalid. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

          If complaint had been properly drawn, the purging by the trial court of a specific number of paper ballots in a particular precinct might well have been appropriate. But in the complaint, the contestant failed to demonstrate that a purge of those ballots would have changed the result of the election or rendered its outcome uncertain. Therefore, the court had no choice but to conclude that the chancellor correctly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

          The allegations of the complaint were insufficient to show, district-wide, that the election was so permeated by fraud or illegality as to render the results incurably uncertain or to thwart the will of the electorate. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

            The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) Prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) Ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. But not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
           </p>
           <p>
            Courts should be appropriately reluctant to take the step of declaring an election invalid. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
           </p>
           <p>
            If complaint had been properly drawn, the purging by the trial court of a specific number of paper ballots in a particular precinct might well have been appropriate. But in the complaint, the contestant failed to demonstrate that a purge of those ballots would have changed the result of the election or rendered its outcome uncertain. Therefore, the court had no choice but to conclude that the chancellor correctly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
           </p>
           <p>
            The allegations of the complaint were insufficient to show, district-wide, that the election was so permeated by fraud or illegality as to render the results incurably uncertain or to thwart the will of the electorate. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

       Where a candidate lost a judicial election by 119 votes and alleged that irregularities involving the time limit for voting, the use of paper ballots, and evidence of identification warranted a new election, the complaint was properly dismissed in part because the allegations of misconduct on the part of election officials were insufficient to taint the election; however, the complaint stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted on the basis that the number of claimed illegal votes cast was 120 or more.

       The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. But not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
      </p>

       Courts should be appropriately reluctant to take the step of declaring an election invalid. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a complaint had been properly drawn, the purging by the trial court of a specific number of paper ballots in a particular precinct might well have been appropriate. But in the complaint, the contestant failed to demonstrate that a purge of those ballots would have changed the result of the election or rendered its outcome uncertain. Therefore, the court had no choice but to conclude that the chancellor correctly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

       The allegations of the complaint were insufficient to show, district-wide, that the election was so permeated by fraud or illegality as to render the results incurably uncertain or to thwart the will of the electorate. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

   The exercise of free speech rights conflicts with another fundamental right, the right to cast a ballot in an election free from the taint of intimidation and fraud. Some restricted zone around polling places is necessary to protect that fundamental right. Given the conflict between these two rights, requiring solicitors to stand 100 feet from the entrances to polling places does not constitute an unconstitutional compromise. Freeman v.

   The state supreme court held that the state showed a compelling interest in banning solicitation of voters or distribution of campaign materials within the polling place itself, but that T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-111" target="_self">2-7-111</a></cite> was not narrowly tailored to advance the state's interest; however, the U.S. Supreme Court, reversing, held that this statute was constitutional. The state supreme court found that the statute prohibited all campaign activity from an arc of 100 feet from every entrance to the polling places, and in many instances, this arc would extend onto public streets and sidewalks, and that the state did not show a compelling interest in the 100 foot radius; and that, therefore, T.C.A. §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-111" target="_self">2-7-111</a></cite> and<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c19s2-19-119" target="_self">2-19-119</a></cite>, which provide criminal penalties for violations of this section, were constitutionally invalid.

       No individual who voted in the election was not a registered voter, and as such, there was absolutely no proof that the result of the election would be different by even one vote had these registered voters been required to present additional evidence of identification, given that they were all properly registered voters; because the result of the election would have been the same even if additional identification had been requested and presented, none of the votes were “illegal”, and, therefore, the extreme remedy of voiding the election was not appropriate.

       If a voter is challenged on the ground that he is not a registered voter at that polling place, and the voter does not protest and assert that he is qualified to vote there, he is bound by the challenge even if the officials are incorrect.

       Where a candidate lost a judicial election by 119 votes and alleged that irregularities involving the time limit for voting, the use of paper ballots, and evidence of identification warranted a new election, the complaint was properly dismissed in part because the allegations of misconduct on the part of election officials were insufficient to taint the election; however, the complaint stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted on the basis that the number of claimed illegal votes cast was 120 or more.

       The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) Prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) Ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. But not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

   It is apparent that the general assembly contemplated that persons marking ballots might not do so in literal compliance with the provisions of the statutes. The last sentence of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-133ol1b" target="_self">2-7-133(b)</a></cite> indicates a legislative intent that a ballot which is not perfectly marked may still be counted if the intent of the voter can be ascertained therefrom. Hall v. Pate, 611 S.W.2d 577, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 403 (Tenn. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a complaint had been properly drawn, the purging by the trial court of a specific number of paper ballots in a particular precinct might well have been appropriate. But in the complaint, the contestant failed to demonstrate that a purge of those ballots would have changed the result of the election or rendered its outcome uncertain. Therefore, the court had no choice but to conclude that the chancellor correctly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The allegations of the complaint were insufficient to show, district-wide, that the election was so permeated by fraud or illegality as to render the results incurably uncertain or to thwart the will of the electorate. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that a voter designate the candidate of his choice by a cross (X) is not mandatory in the sense that a voter who uses a different mark, such as a check mark, will be deprived of his vote, where the intention is clear. Menees v. Ewing, 141 Tenn. 399, 210 S.W. 648, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1918).

       Ballots marked opposite blank space reserved for write-in candidate were not as a matter of law required to be counted for a candidate whose name appeared immediately above such blank space. Reeder v. Holt, 220 Tenn. 428, 418 S.W.2d 249, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 424 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a voter makes his choice clear and obvious his vote should be counted but if it is impossible to determine the voter's choice for any office from the face of the ballot his vote should not be counted. Reeder v. Holt, 220 Tenn. 428, 418 S.W.2d 249, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 424 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether disputed ballots should have been counted by election judges was a question to be determined from what appeared on the face of each ballot and not on evidence aliunde. Reeder v. Holt, 220 Tenn. 428, 418 S.W.2d 249, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 424 (1967).

       The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) Prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) Ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. But not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

       Courts should be appropriately reluctant to take the step of declaring an election invalid. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

       Where a candidate lost a judicial election by 119 votes and alleged that irregularities involving the time limit for voting, the use of paper ballots, and evidence of identification warranted a new election, the complaint was properly dismissed in part because the allegations of misconduct on the part of election officials were insufficient to taint the election; however, the complaint stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted on the basis that the number of claimed illegal votes cast was 120 or more. Stuart v. Anderson County Election Comm'n, 237 S.W.3d 297, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 215 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 13, 2007), rehearing denied, 237 S.W.3d 297, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 824 (Tenn. Ct.

       Voters in the election were faced with a ballot presented to them that was of such length that 46% of the voters took longer than five minutes and 5% of the voters took ten minutes or more to vote, and to hold these votes illegal would be to disenfranchise those voters for something over which they had neither the control nor the responsibility; there was no evidence that any voter who exceeded the time limit did so for an improper purpose or for any reason other than the length of the ballot.

       The case law of this state recognizes that statutory violations alone may be sufficient to invalidate an election, especially where they thwart those statutory provisions designed to: (1) Prevent undue influence or intimidation of the free and fair expression of the will of the electors; or (2) Ensure that only those who meet the statutory requirements for eligibility to vote, cast ballots. But not every irregularity, or even a combination of irregularities, will necessitate the invalidation of an election. Forbes v. Bell, 816 S.W.2d 716, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (Tenn. 1991).

       Trial court properly dismissed a write-in candidate's constitutional challenge to the write-in candidate statute because the statute was constitutional as written and as applied where it was narrowly written to allow election officials to know the supplies needed and the instructions to give to poll officials in order to accommodate those who wished to write-in their votes, the Election Code was comprehensive, and the candidate acknowledged that he did not comply with the requirements.

       It is apparent that the General Assembly contemplated that persons marking ballots might not do so in literal compliance with the provisions of the statutes. The last sentence of subsection (b) indicates a legislative intent that a ballot which is not perfectly marked may still be counted if the intent of the voter can be ascertained therefrom. Hall v.

      Attorney General Opinions. Political canvassing is an expressive activity protected by the First Amendment, but the First Amendment prohibits only state action that abridges speech or expression. Homeowners' associations are private entities, not state actors, and are not subject to the First Amendment. Thus, private homeowners' associations may prohibit or otherwise restrict political canvassing without implicating the First Amendment.  Furthermore, the Tennessee Freedom of Speech Act does not place any restrictions on homeowners' associations with respect to political canvassing. Nor do other statutes limit the authority of homeowners' associations to prohibit or otherwise restrict political canvassing. OAG 19-13, 2019 Tenn. AG LEXIS 34 (9/5/2019).

       Where a candidate lost a judicial election by 119 votes and alleged that irregularities involving the time limit for voting, the use of paper ballots, and evidence of identification warranted a new election, the complaint was properly dismissed in part because the allegations of misconduct on the part of election officials were insufficient to taint the election; however, the complaint stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted on the basis that the number of claimed illegal votes cast was 120 or more.

The candidates who receive the highest number of votes shall be declared elected or nominated; provided, that in order for any person to receive a party nomination by write-in ballots, such person must receive a number of write-in votes equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of the total number of registered voters of the district.

Such person shall only have votes counted in counties where such notice was completed and timely filed. Write-in candidates for the offices of governor, United States senator and representative in the United States congress shall file their notice with the state coordinator of elections. The notice shall be on a form prescribed by the coordinator of elections and shall not require signatures of any person other than the write-in candidate requesting ballots be counted. The coordinator of elections shall distribute such form to the county election commissions. Upon timely receiving the notice required by this subsection (c), the county election commission shall promptly inform the state coordinator of elections, the registry of election finance, as well as all other candidates participating in the affected election.

A proposed amendment to the statute, which would change the requirement that write-in candidates in primary elections must receive at least five percent of the “total number of votes cast in the election” in order to win to five percent of the “registered voters in the district,” would indirectly affect independent candidates as the amendment would make it more difficult for write-in candidates for primary elections to meet the five percent requirement, OAG 02-069 (5/22/02).

     <p>
      The governing body of a city, town or county may adopt voting machines and, upon the adoption and purchase of voting machines, shall provide for payment for the machines in the way it deems for the best interest of the locality and may for that purpose issue bonds, certificates of indebtedness or other obligations which shall be a charge on the city, town or county. Such bonds, certificates or other obligations may be issued with or without interest, payable at such time or times as the authorities may determine, but shall not be issued or sold at less than par. If it is proposed that bonds be issued to finance the purchase of voting machines, such bonds may not be issued unless approved in an election by a majority of the votes cast by the voters of the city, town or county affected.

   When the governing body of a county requests the coordinator of elections to have the state finance the acquisition of a specified number of voting machines under §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c09s2-9-112" target="_self">2-9-112</a></cite> —<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c09s2-9-114" target="_self">2-9-114</a></cite>, the governing body of the county and the coordinator of elections shall enter into an agreement to be known as a “contract, lease and option,” subject to the following requirements:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t02c09s2-9-112ol11">
       The original lease term shall be for a period agreed to by the governing body of the county and the coordinator of elections. The county shall have the exclusive right and option to extend the term of the lease from year to year for periods of one (1) year at a time for an agreed period. The total lease period shall in no case exceed twenty (20) years.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c09s2-9-112ol12">
       The rentals prescribed for the original term and for each of the full number of years for which the lease may be extended shall not be less than the amounts required in each of such years to amortize the total amount of bonds issued to defray the cost of the machines.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c09s2-9-112ol13">
       The governing body of the county shall agree, in each effective year of the lease, to maintain the voting machines.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c09s2-9-112ol14">
       If the governing body of the county fails or neglects to pay any of the rentals prescribed, the commissioner of finance and administration shall retain the sum necessary for such payment out of any state funds distributable to the county for any purpose. No statutory requirement that any distributable, state collected, locally shared funds shall be used exclusively for a designated purpose shall be construed as preventing the commissioner of finance and administration from taking out of such fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c09s2-9-112ol15">
       The contract, lease and option may contain any other reasonable provision deemed necessary and desirable by the commissioner, the coordinator of elections or the governing body of the county.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c09s2-9-112ol16">
       Subject to all of the above, when the governing body of a county requests the coordinator of elections to have the state finance the cost of modifying its voting machines in order to comply with the specifications of this chapter, the governing body of the county and the coordinator of elections shall enter into an agreement to be known as a “voting machine loan agreement.” The agreement shall be subject to all the terms and conditions as if the county were purchasing machines. The agreement shall provide that the state maintain a lien on such machines until such agreement is satisfied and that such agreements are subject to an annual interest rate of six percent (6%).

IV, § 1, was affirmed because even if the appellate court were to concede that paperless voting could disenfranchise voters under certain circumstances, there was no indication in the complaint that voters were presently being disenfranchised by the current voting system.

       State law does not prohibit elected state officials from using state property, including the Executive Residence, for campaign-related activities.  Tennessee’s Campaign Financial Disclosure Act would require the disclosure of expenditures incurred for such campaign-related activities on state property if they constitute either a “contribution” or an “expenditure” as defined under the Act. To the extent that the Governor’s non-personal schedule, including events at the Executive Residence, meets the definition of “public record” as set forth in T.C.A. § 10-7503(a)(1)(A), then it is subject to disclosure under Tennessee’s Public Records Act, unless a state law provides otherwise. OAG 16-48, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 47 (12/22/2016).

       State law does not prohibit elected state officials from using state property, including the Executive Residence, for campaign-related activities. Tennessee’s Campaign Financial Disclosure Act would require the disclosure of expenditures incurred for such campaign-related activities on state property if they constitute either a “contribution” or an “expenditure” as defined under the Act. To the extent that the Governor’s non-personal schedule, including events at the Executive Residence, meets the definition of “public record” as set forth in T.C.A. § 10-7503(a)(1)(A), then it is subject to disclosure under Tennessee’s Public Records Act, unless a state law provides otherwise.

A violation of this section subjects the member to immediate removal from office by a majority vote of the other members of the state election commission. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a member of the state election commission from providing uncompensated advice on a one-on-one basis to a candidate or party officer, nor shall it prohibit providing a financial contribution to a candidate or party organization.

         Without question, the commission and the coordinator have certain statutorily prescribed ministerial duties that allow, indeed require, them to do such things as examine ballot initiatives to determine whether signature requirements are met, determine whether submissions are timely, and determine whether candidates have properly qualified to be placed on the ballot; however, these statutes do not require or even permit the commission to refuse to include a referendum question on the ballot because the commission believes the question to be substantively unconstitutional. Determining the substantive constitutionality of such measures is a function reserved for the judicial branch of government. City of Memphis v. Shelby County Election Comm'n, 146 S.W.3d 531, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 802 (Tenn. 2004).

         Local elections commission's ministerial duties are clear with regard to finalizing the list of candidates on an election ballot; it is implicit in executing these ministerial duties that the commission and election coordinator must be able to determine whether a candidate is disqualified to run due to his or her residency or some other factor. McFarland v. Pemberton, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 908 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2015), aff'd, McFarland v. Pemberton, 530 S.W.3d 76, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 561 (Tenn. Sept. 20, 2017).

         By necessary implication, a county election commission had the authority under Tennessee's election statutes to hold a quasi-judicial hearing to make a factual determination to resolve a voter's complaint challenging a judicial candidate's residency.

         County election commission erred by refusing to place an ordinance on the ballot based upon the state election coordinator's opinion that the ordinance was unconstitutional, as duties of the commission and the coordinator were ministerial; thus, they did not have the authority to determine whether the proposed ordinance would have been constitutional had the measure passed.

        Where election commission filed petition for writ of mandamus and declaratory judgment on April 10, 1981, to compel board of commissioners to provide adequate and economically feasible storage for the county's 1,200 voting machines, the lease on the premises where the machines were then being stored being due to expire on April 30, 1981, and the county having failed to exercise its option to renew within 60 days of expiration as required by the lease, the trial court was correct in refusing to issue writ of mandamus and in denying an award of attorneys' fees to the election commission, because the suit was premature, since the county was fulfilling its duty to provide storage for the machines, and the election commission had made no showing that the county would not do so in the future.

The petition shall be accompanied by the name and address of the person or the names and addresses of the members of the group or association filing the petition to form the recognized minor political party.

If the coordinator of elections determines the petition meets the statutory requirements to be declared a recognized minor party, the candidates seeking to represent such minor party shall be placed on the appropriate primary ballot for such minor party.

       </p>
       <p>
        Tennessee's ballot-retention requirement for minor political parties violates the Equal Protection Clause because it imposes a greater burden on minor parties without a sufficient rationale; the statute forces minor parties to attain the same vote percentage as major parties in less time in order to remain on the ballot.

        The general rule is that only a substantial compliance, rather than a strictly literal compliance, with the election laws is required, so that, absent proof of fraud, the court would not hold illegal either the ballots of persons who merely voted in the wrong city precinct or the ballots of women who had married since their prior registration and who had simply failed to report a change of name; but where there were more than five clearly illegal ballots cast in an election because of the improper and unauthorized late registration of voters who had not previously registered to vote in municipal elections, those were not minor or technical violations but rather violations of major and important statutory provisions governing the registration of voters, so that the election was held void and a new election ordered.

   Where plaintiffs' argument that the reapportionment effected by this section in 1972 was unconstitutional, was based upon the population figures in the official 1970 federal census, and opposing parties offered the figures in the 1975 “provisional estimates” of population to show that the original malapportionment had corrected itself, the court held that in the absence of clear, cogent and convincing proof that the 1975 figures were the best evidence as opposed to the 1970 figures, the court had to rely on the 1970 figures and thus entered a decree reapportioning the districts.

       An election contest is a proper proceeding to test the validity of an election on the charge that the candidate receiving the highest number of votes cast in the election had not complied with the residence requirement and was ineligible on the day of the election to hold the office. Hatcher v. Bell, 521 S.W.2d 799, 1974 Tenn. LEXIS 427 (Tenn. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiffs in action for declaratory judgment claimed that county referendum election was invalid because the question submitted was inadequate and misleading in that it failed to refer to the effect which the private act voted upon had on the powers and functions of the county judge, the claims amounted to an election contest. Dehoff v. Attorney Gen., 564 S.W.2d 361, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 539 (Tenn. 1978).

   Where a complaint alleged that under the rules of the State Democratic Party, the Democratic Executive Committee had no power to nominate candidates for Justice of the State Supreme Court and that the nomination of defendant by the committee was void, the complaint alleged no irregularities in the general election nor any constitutional disqualifications on the part of defendant, and thus, although the complaint termed itself an “election contest,” it was no more than a contest of the nomination and failed to come under the purview of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c17s2-17-101" target="_self">2-17-101</a></cite>.

   Judgment declaring the candidate's opponent the winner of the election was affirmed in accordance with T.R.A.P. 24(c), because the appellate court must presume that the evidence supported the trial court's findings and ultimate conclusion that the candidate had not proven that the two votes were illegal such that a new election should be ordered; in order for the candidate to prove that there were two illegal votes, he must demonstrate that the two voters voted by paper ballot when all others voters voted by machine, and that these two voters did not use a paper ballot because they were in need of assistance pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-116" target="_self">2-7-116</a></cite>.

   Disappointed candidate for a county commission seat failed to establish grounds for an election contest under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c17s2-17-101" target="_self">2-17-101</a></cite> et seq., based on the election commission's honest mistake in accepting the candidate's opponent's petition signatures, although two signatures were found to be invalid. There was no allegation that anyone cast an illegal vote, and no showing that the election was so permeated with fraud and illegality that it could not be said to fairly reflect the will of the voters. Barrett v. Giles County, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 548 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 5, 2011).

   Where city officials, concerned over the loss of revenue which would be sustained if a county referendum resulted in a favorable vote on the enabling sales tax resolution adopted by the quarterly county court [now county legislative body], met twice informally prior to the referendum, but their objective was not to organize a campaign in opposition to the question presented to the voters but to await the results and thereafter take whatever action they deemed to be in the interests of their respective cities, the city officials did not constitute a “campaign committee” or individuals who had “charge of a campaign for the adoption or rejection of a question submitted to the people” within the purview of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c17s2-17-101" target="_self">2-17-101</a></cite> and so had no standing to contest the referendum.

       An election contest is a proper proceeding to test the validity of an election on the charge that the candidate receiving the highest number of votes in the election has not complied with the residence requirements set forth in the constitution and was ineligible on the day of election to hold office.

       Trial court was authorized to void the election for the office of county sheriff because ballots intended for the opposing candidate were not illegally rejected, but rather, the other candidate was disqualified since he did not have the requisite experience; the opposing candidate did not allege any illegality in the manner and form of the election or the way in which the votes were tabulated.

       Trial court did not err in voiding an election for the office of county sheriff because a candidate was not qualified as a candidate for the office since he did not have the requisite three-years of “full-time” experience; the candidate's employment with the a police department could not be classified as “full-time” experience because his primary source of income was derived from his employment as the director of emergency medical services for the county.

        Evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant's convictions for procuring an illegal vote because the evidence showed that defendant, who by her own acknowledgment was well-versed in election law, “procured, aided, and assisted” three individuals to vote in the 2009 municipal election, knowing that they were disqualified to vote due to their felony convictions, by encouraging them to participate in early voting and picking them up in a church van and carrying them to the polls.

        Defendant's frequent visits to request voting rights restoration information were relevant to show defendant's knowledge of the restoration process for convicted felons, and the testimony about a warning telephone call to defendant about proper behavior for campaign volunteers was relevant to show defendant's knowledge of the election process, for purposes of her procuring an illegal vote conviction.

   The state supreme court held T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07s2-7-111" target="_self">2-7-111</a></cite> was not narrowly tailored to advance the state's interest, and therefore violated the first amendment. However, the U.S. Supreme Court held that T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c19s2-19-119" target="_self">2-19-119</a></cite> was constitutional. In reversing, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the state has a compelling interest in protecting voters from confusion and undue influence, and that the 100-foot boundary established by these sections was narrowly enough tailored to this interest, so as to be valid under the first and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

        No person who has been convicted of an infamous crime, as defined by § 40-20-112, in this state shall be permitted to register to vote or vote at any election unless such person has been pardoned by the governor, or the person's full rights of citizenship have otherwise been restored as prescribed by law. However, the governor may attach to any such pardon a special condition that such person shall not have the right of suffrage until a date certain in the future, or until the expiration of the pardoned sentence, whichever period of time is less.

       <li id="t02c19s2-19-143ol13">
        No person who has been convicted in another state of a crime or offense which would constitute an infamous crime under the laws of this state, regardless of the sentence imposed, shall be allowed to register to vote or vote at any election in this state unless such person has been pardoned or restored to the rights of citizenship by the governor or other appropriate authority of such other state, or the person's full rights of citizenship have otherwise been restored in accordance with the laws of such other state, or the law of this state.

       </p>
       <p>
        “‘Teacher’ shall mean any person employed in a public school as a teacher, helping teacher, librarian, principal, or supervisor, and shall include any superintendent of public schools, or administrative officer of a department of education, or of any educational institution supported in whole or in part by and under the control of the state. In all cases of doubt, the board of trustees hereinafter defined shall determine whether any person is a teacher as defined in this chapter.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments. The 2015 amendment added “‘Public lands, offices, buildings, vehicles, and facilities’ include those owned and used by a local education agency (LEA)” at the end of (2); in (3), added “, including teachers” at the end of the first sentence and deleted “teachers, as defined by § 49-1501,” preceding “members of the governor's cabinet”; added the definition of “teacher”; and made related punctuation changes.

        State law does not prohibit elected state officials from using state property, including the Executive Residence, for campaign-related activities.  Tennessee’s Campaign Financial Disclosure Act would require the disclosure of expenditures incurred for such campaign-related activities on state property if they constitute either a “contribution” or an “expenditure” as defined under the Act. To the extent that the Governor’s non-personal schedule, including events at the Executive Residence, meets the definition of “public record” as set forth in T.C.A. § 10-7503(a)(1)(A), then it is subject to disclosure under Tennessee’s Public Records Act, unless a state law provides otherwise.
