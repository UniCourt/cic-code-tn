        Where land is ceded to or purchased by the United States with the consent of the state legislature, under U.S. Const., art. 1, § 8, clause 17, the federal courts have jurisdiction of the prosecution for a crime committed thereon, to the exclusion of the state courts. But where the federal government is a proprietor by purchase without cession, the rule does not apply; and failure of such government to file map in office of county court clerk (now county clerk) to show the consent of the state to acquisition of the property by the United States leaves the jurisdiction in the state courts.

         Since judges of intermediate appellate courts are not assigned to any district or circuit, voting by district or circuit is not required, and this is in no way changed by the requirement that no more than four of the 12 judges on each intermediate appellate court may reside in any one of three grand divisions of Tennessee; a district is a political subdivision, and while a district usually connotes a subunit of a county and may be subject to reconfiguration, a grand division refers to one of three permanently defined, large umbrella units, each composed of many counties and districts, and a grand division is not a district within the meaning of the Constitution.

      The boundary line between this state and the state of North Carolina, as run by commissioners appointed for the purpose of running and marking the same, begins at a stone set up on the north side of Cataloochee Turnpike Road, and marked on the west side, “Ten., 1821,” and on the east side, “N.C., 1821”; running thence in a southwestwardly course to the Bald Rock, on the summit of the Great Iron or Smoky Mountain, and continuing southwestwardly on the extreme height thereof to where it strikes Tennessee River, about seven (7) miles above the old Indian town of Tallassee, crossing Porter's Gap at the distance of twenty-two (22) miles from the beginning, passing Meigs' boundary line at thirty-one and one-half (31 ½) miles, the Equovettly path at fifty-three (53) miles and crossing Tennessee River at the distance of sixty-five (65) miles from the beginning; from Tennessee River to the main ridge, and along the extreme height of the same to the place where it is called Unicoi or Unaka Mountain, striking the old trading path leading from the Valley Towns to the Overhills Towns, near the head of the west fork of Tellico River, and at the distance of ninety-three (93) miles from the beginning; thence along the extreme height of Unicoi or Unaka Mountain to the southwest end thereof, at the Unicoi or Unaka Turnpike Road, where a cornerstone is set up, marked “Ten.” on the west side and “N.C.” on the east side, and where a hickory tree is also marked on the south side, “Ten. 101 M.,” and on the north side, “N.C. 101 M.,” being one hundred one (101) miles from the beginning; from thence a due course south two (2) miles and two hundred fifty-two (252) poles to a spruce pine on the north bank of the Hiwassee River below the mouth of Cane Creek; thence up that river the same course about one (1) mile, and crossing the same to a maple, marked “W.D.” and “R.A.,” on the south bank of the river; thence continuing the same course due south eleven (11) miles and two hundred seventy-three (273) poles to the southern boundary of the states of Tennessee and North Carolina, making in all one hundred sixteen (116) miles and two hundred twenty-three (223) poles from the beginning, and striking the southern boundary line twenty-three (23) poles west of a tree in that line, marked “72 M.,” where was set up by the commissioners a square post, marked on the west side “Ten., 1821,” and on the east side, “N.C., 1821,” and on the south, “G.”

      Compiler's Notes. The North Carolina commissioners in 1799 began at the Virginia line and ran the boundary line to the top of a high pinnacle of the Smoky Mountain beyond the French Broad River, where they stopped. The joint commissioners of North Carolina and Tennessee in 1821 began at the termination of the line run by the North Carolina commissioners and surveyed to the Georgia line. See McCarty v. Carolina Lumber Co., 134 Tenn. 35, 182 S.W. 909, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (1915).

      Compiler's Notes. Walker's line is one run by Virginia commissioners in 1780, and Henderson's line is one run by North Carolina commissioners in what is now Tennessee in pursuance of Acts 1779 (Apr.), ch. 16. These two lines resulted from the disagreement of the commissioners representing the respective states, and are about two miles apart. See Parker v. Claiborne, 32 Tenn. 565 (1852).
     </p>
     <p>
      By compact between Virginia and Tennessee, it was agreed that a line equally distant from Walker's line and Henderson's line should be the true boundary line between them, which line was run and marked in pursuance of statutes of each state in 1802 and confirmed by Acts 1803, ch. 58. See Campbell v. Crockett, 16 Tenn. 225 (1835); Lessee of Brock v. Burchett, 32 Tenn. 27 (1852); Parker v. Claiborne, 32 Tenn. 565 (1852); Sharp v. Van Winkle, 80 Tenn. 15 (1883).

       The boundary line between Arkansas and Tennessee, changes by avulsion disregarded, is the middle of the main navigable channel of the Mississippi River, in the absence of a special convention between such states, or long use equivalent thereto. Arkansas v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">246 U.S. 158</cite>, <cite class="s_court">38 S. Ct. 301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">62 L. Ed. 638</cite>, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1531 (1918).

      <p>
       The boundary line is the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Mississippi River (as distinguished from a line midway between the visible and fixed banks of the stream) as it was at the time when the current ceased to flow therein as a result of the avulsion of 1876, and without regard to changes in the banks or channel that had occurred through the natural and gradual processes of erosion and accretion prior to the avulsion. Cissna v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">246 U.S. 289</cite>, <cite class="s_court">38 S. Ct. 306</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">62 L. Ed. 720</cite>, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1547 (1918).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The change made in its channel by the Mississippi River in 1876 at Centennial Cut-Off was an avulsion and the boundary line between the states of Tennessee and Arkansas remained where it was originally fixed, in the middle of the abandoned channel. Stockley v. Cissna, 119 Tenn. 135, 104 S.W. 792, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1907); Laxon v. State, 126 Tenn. 302, 148 S.W. 1059, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (Tenn. Apr. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a navigable stream forming the boundary line between states, from any cause, natural or artificial, suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, by the process known as an avulsion, the boundary line between the states is unaffected and remains in the middle of the former main channel of navigation. Arkansas v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">246 U.S. 158</cite>, <cite class="s_court">38 S. Ct. 301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">62 L. Ed. 638</cite>, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1531 (1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a running stream forms an interstate boundary, if the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes of erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream; while if the stream suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, the resulting change of channel works no change of boundary, which remains in the middle of the old channel although no water is flowing in it. Cissna v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">246 U.S. 289</cite>, <cite class="s_court">38 S. Ct. 306</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">62 L. Ed. 720</cite>, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1547 (1918).

       Trial court, on remand, properly granted a motion filed by the commissioner of the Department of General Services for summary judgment in a former employee's action for alleged unpaid holiday compensation because the suit against the commissioner in his official capacity was actually a suit against his office, the Department proved the necessary statutory criteria, and the employee was not a state employee on the last scheduled workday immediately preceding the holiday at issue.

       Dismissal of a quo warranto action for lack of standing was appropriate because property owners and attorneys who represented property owners in forfeiture proceedings lacked standing to bring the action in their own names on any public official bond or a blanket surety bond in that, even assuming that a surety issued such a bond or bonds, the bonds were payable to the state, but the State of Tennessee was not seeking recovery.

I, § 1 because the inmate failed to cite authority that the adoption of the lethal injection protocol violated procedural due process and the method of lethal injection was created by the legislature and that the implementation of lethal injection was left to the Department of Correction pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c23s40-23-114ol1c" target="_blank">40-23-114(c)</a></cite>; further, the Department was not subject to the notice and approval provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA) because Department procedures were not “rules” as defined by the UAPA because they fit squarely into the exceptions under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c05s4-5-102ol110A" target="_self">4-5-102(10)(A)</a></cite>, (G) (now § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c05s4-5-102ol112A" target="_self">4-5-102(12)(A)</a></cite>, (B)(vi).

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of the Tennessee Board of Education did not improperly denied the teacher the opportunity for a hearing concerning the revocation of his license, because the administrative law judge (ALJ) was not required to conduct a pointless evidentiary hearing, when the teacher had the opportunity to make all of his arguments to the ALJ in his response to the Board's motion for summary judgment, the ALJ considered whether lesser remedies were available to the Board, and the teacher had no evidence to present, only legal arguments that could be fully considered in the context of the Board's motion for summary judgment.

        Sanctions imposed by the administrative tribunal upon the insurance agent were clearly warranted in law where no basis existed for finding that the sanction of revocation of license was without justification in fact; neither the chancery court nor the court of appeals was empowered to substitute judicial judgment in the place of the judgment of an administrative tribunal acting within the scope of its statutory authority, and neither the chancellor nor the appellate court could soften the sanctions imposed by the administrative tribunal on the basis that either court felt that the sanctions imposed were too harsh.

        The department of correction's policies affecting the custody and control of inmates need not be promulgated as rules under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. Ogburn v. Tennessee Dep't of Correction, 983 S.W.2d 677, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in its determination that an inmate's administrative segregation status was non-punitive because it was based upon security concerns because he had a history of assaults and disruptive behavior and, that, as such, the common law writ of certiorari was not the proper means for the inmate to challenge his status. Clark v. Rose, 183 S.W.3d 669, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 447 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —,  2005 Tenn. LEXIS 1114 (Tenn. Dec. 5, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly dismissed an inmate's petition under T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c08s27-8-101" target="_blank">27-8-101</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c09s27-9-101" target="_blank">27-9-101</a></cite> for common law writ of certiorari against the Tennessee Department of Correction's (TDOC) and TDOC officials because the inmate failed to seek a declaratory order from TDOC as required by the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c05s4-5-225ol1b" target="_self">4-5-225(b)</a></cite>; the UAPA does not govern inmate challenges to decisions of the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c05s4-5-106ol1c" target="_self">4-5-106(c)</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because an inmate was not entitled to multiple release eligibility dates and consideration for custodial parole, his petition alleging that the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole and Board officials deprived him of the privilege to be heard for custodial parole failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted; therefore, the trial court properly granted the motions of the Board and officials to dismiss the inmate's petition for common law writ of certiorari pursuant to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c08s27-8-101" target="_blank">27-8-101</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c09s27-9-101" target="_blank">27-9-101</a></cite>.

        In promulgating an executive order which established the Commission for Judicial Appointments, the Governor did not violate the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. Durham v.

         It would be unreasonable and inefficient to require an agency to publish the exact text of a proposed rule in order to obtain public reaction thereto and then require a republication and rehearing for every alteration made in the proposed rule before final adoption.

         Administrative rule making does not require that the specific terms of a rule be determined in advance and be finally adopted without modification. It is sufficient if the statutory publication is adequate to inform the public of the subject matter of the rule to be considered and that the public have adequate opportunity to present and support its views as to what rule should be made regarding that subject matter.

         Tennessee claims commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule upon a claim by hospitals for additional Medicaid reimbursement where the claim challenged the validity of a Tennessee department of health regulation promulgated while it was the sole state agency in charge of administering the Medicaid program.

         The HUD regulations do not preempt the Administrative Procedures Act under any of the theories of implied preemption.  OAG 10-105, 2010 Tenn. AG LEXIS 111 (10/15/10).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (“UAPA”) does not violate the Due Process Clause.  Neither Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 nor the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security and Campus Crime Statistics Act (“Clery Act”) preempts the UAPA contested-case provisions applicable to the adjudication of sexual assault claims involving students at Tennessee public institutions of higher education. Disciplinary proceedings in a school sexual assault case must be completed “promptly,” but neither the Due Process Clause, nor Title IX, nor the Clery Act imposes any specified or fixed time limit for the completion of a UAPA contested-case proceeding in sexual assault cases.  The Due Process Clause, Title IX, and the Clery Act all require that an accuser be allowed to participate in a hearing, and the UAPA gives all parties the right to participate in a contested case hearing. To comply with the requirements of Title IX, schools must independently investigate and adjudicate allegations of student-on-student sexual harassment and assault.  Title IX would likely preempt a state law requiring public institutions to refer sexual assault or similar allegations to law enforcement before suspending or expelling a student.  There is currently no federally codified evidentiary standard applicable to such disciplinary proceedings.  However, guidance issued by the Department of Education interpreting Title IX regulations states that schools should apply a preponderance-of-evidence standard in disciplinary proceedings related to claims of sexual assault. OAG 17-03, 2017 Tenn. AG LEXIS 3 (1/17/2017).

          Contested case proceedings involving certificates of authority for radio common carriers must be consistent not only with the State Radio Common Carrier Act, compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.65.html#t65c30s65-30-101" target="_blank">65-30-101</a></cite> et seq., and the public service commission's enabling statutes but also with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5; while the commission may conduct contested case proceedings itself, it may also appoint a hearing officer to hear all or any part of a particular case.

          Second administrative judge's order exceeded the scope of his authority because neither the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act nor the Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act gave an administrative judge the authority to limit a party's legal arguments to the Tennessee Underground Storage Tanks and Solid Waste Disposal Control Board; and, by doing so, the judge's order infringed not only on the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's statutory right to present a brief and an oral argument expressing its legal theories, but also on the Board's responsibility to review the initial order and render a final order.

          The failure of the department of employment security to inform plaintiff of the availability of free or low-cost representation does not per se show prejudice and require that a new hearing be conducted on plaintiff's claim. Simmons v. Traughber, 791 S.W.2d 21, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 213 (Tenn. 1990).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where employer had an attorney who examined the documentary evidence prior to the hearing, and plaintiff did not have an attorney or access to the documentary evidence prior to the hearing, was a laborer, had no legal training or experience, and was not able to adequately express herself at the hearing, department of employment security's failure to inform plaintiff of her right to free or low-cost representation resulted in prejudice to plaintiff. Simmons v. Traughber, 791 S.W.2d 21, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 213 (Tenn. 1990).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where notice department of employment security sent plaintiff stated: “You may be represented by counsel or other authorized representative at your own expense,” notice did not adequately inform plaintiff of her right to be represented at the hearing, because the tone of the notice was negative and misleading, and for many unemployed claimants, a notice that they can be represented by counsel at their own expense will terminate their interest in obtaining an attorney and seeking benefits under the statute; and because plaintiff did not receive full and meaningful notice of her right to be represented by counsel before the appeals tribunal, she was denied her statutory right to a fair hearing.

          Denial of medical licensure in Tennessee to an applicant was not inappropriate because the decision by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners that the applicant's long absence from direct patient care necessitated a formal assessment before the applicant could engage in the practice of emergency medicine in Tennessee was not unclear, arbitrary and capricious, or unsupported by substantial and material evidence.

          The making or preservation of a record of the informal conference discussion of a decision is not deemed to be mandatory under ordinary circumstances; however, when the parties are present to hear such discussion or same is recorded by the commission, it is not reversible error for the reviewing court to consider such record to the extent that it may be material to the issues on review.

          When the grant, denial, or renewal of a license is required to be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing, the provisions of this chapter concerning contested cases apply.
         </li>
         <li id="t04c05s4-5-320ol1b">
          When a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license or a new license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature, the existing license does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency, and, in case the application is denied or the terms of the new license limited, until the last day for seeking review of the agency order or a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court.

          No revocation, suspension, or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct that warrant the intended action, and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license. If the agency finds that public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, summary action, including suspension of a license or other licensure restriction or action as may be appropriate to protect the public, may be ordered pending proceedings for revocation or other action. These proceedings shall be promptly instituted and determined.

            The notice provided to the licensee may be provided by any reasonable means and shall inform the licensee of the reasons for the action or intended action of the agency and of the opportunity for an informal hearing, review or conference before the agency. The informal hearing, review or conference described by this subsection (d) shall not be required to be held under the contested case provisions of this chapter. The hearing, review or conference is intended to provide an informal, reasonable opportunity for the licensee to present the licensee's version of the situation to the person or entity authorized by law to take the summary action against the license involved. Whether the informal hearing, review or conference is held before or after an order of summary action, the sole issue to be considered is whether the public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action by the agency.

The reviewing court shall not consider a stay unless notice has been given to the attorney general and reporter; nor shall the reviewing court consider a stay unless the petitioner has previously sought a stay from the agency or demonstrates that an agency ruling on a stay application cannot be obtained within a reasonable time.
         </li>
         <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1d">
          Within forty-five (45) days after service of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all the parties of the review proceedings, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional cost. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.
         </li>
         <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1e">
          If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings or decisions with the reviewing court.
         </li>
         <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1f">
          The procedure ordinarily followed in the reviewing court will be followed in the review of contested cases decided by the agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The agency that issued the decision to be reviewed is not required to file a responsive pleading.
         </li>
         <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1g">
          The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court.
         </li>
         <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1h">
          The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if the rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:
          <ol>
           <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1h1">
            In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;

             <li id="t04c05s4-5-322ol1h5B">
              In determining the substantiality of evidence, the court shall take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight, but the court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.

          The chancery court, on judicial review or in a declaratory judgment action, may consider constitutional issues arising as the result of a contested case proceeding even though the issues were not raised in the agency or, if raised, were not addressed. Richardson v. Board of Dentistry, 913 S.W.2d 446, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 788 (Tenn. 1995).
         </p>
         <p>
          Plaintiff's argument that plaintiff was denied equal protection under the law was without merit, where the appraisal and assessment of properties, using the direct comparable sales method, was in compliance with the statutory requirement of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c05s67-5-601ol1a" target="_blank">67-5-601(a)</a></cite>. Willamette Indus., Inc. v. Tennessee Assessment Appeals Comm'n, 11 S.W.3d 142, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 611 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
         </p>
         <p>
          The mere fact that assessing agencies have employed different appraisal methods is, without more, of no constitutional moment; no authority suggests that any single appraisal methodology is mandated, to the exclusion of all others. Willamette Indus., Inc. v. Tennessee Assessment Appeals Comm'n, 11 S.W.3d 142, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 611 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).

          The courts of Tennessee have had the same power both before and after the adoption of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act to review the actions of administrative bodies for violations of constitutional or statutory provisions. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Public Service Com., 493 F. Supp. 162, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17954 (M.D. Tenn. 1978), aff'd, 631 F.2d 426, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 13669 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1980).

          In termination of tenured state university faculty proceedings, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.49.html#t49c08s49-8-302" target="_blank">49-8-302</a></cite> — <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.49.html#t49c08s49-8-304" target="_blank">49-8-304</a></cite> apply, rather than the more general provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act. Frye v. Memphis State University, 671 S.W.2d 467, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 927 (Tenn. 1984).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where petitioner pursued a Title VII civil rights claim in federal court rather than seeking review of administrative proceedings in state court under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c05s4-5-322" target="_self">4-5-322</a></cite>, res judicata did not foreclose the action in federal court. University of Tennessee v. Elliott, <cite class="us_code">478 U.S. 788</cite>, <cite class="s_court">106 S. Ct. 3220</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">92 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 635, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 142 (1986).
         </p>
         <p>
          The term de novo as applied to judicial review and as contemplated by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.67.html#t67c05s67-5-1511" target="_blank">67-5-1511</a></cite> means a new hearing in the chancery court based upon the administrative record and any additional or supplemental evidence that either party wishes to adduce relevant to any issue. On the other hand the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, by its terms, restricts review to the record except for irregularities in procedure not shown by the record. Richardson v. Tennessee Assessment Appeals Com., 828 S.W.2d 403, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 742 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 783 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 1, 1991).

          In a case where a landfill was discharging contaminants into a creek, the Tennessee Court of Appeals did not properly apply the narrow standard of review required for review of a cleanup agreement; a decision of the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Control Board was not arbitrary or capricious because it was based on reasoning and the exercise of judgment and gave fair consideration to a diversion option. The Court of Appeals misapplied the arbitrary and capricious standard and instead substituted its judgment for that of the Board; the search for a solution to the problem was not within the province of the Court of Appeals.

          Board did not reject or modify the findings of the administrative law judge (ALJ); instead, the Board rejected the ALJ's recommendation and voted to uphold the management decision to terminate the worker. Because the Board disagreed with the ALJ, the Board's decision was subject to closer judicial scrutiny, and although the Board was entitled to make its own decision, the Board should not have ignored the ALJ's findings of fact. The Board's decision to reject the recommendation of the ALJ was arbitrary and capricious. Elec. Emles. Civ. Serv. & Pension Bd. of the Metro. Gov't v. Mansell, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn.

          Trial court properly reversed a civil service commission's decision to reinstate a police officer where the commission and court identified the appropriate program provisions that applied to the disciplinary proceeding, the expert testimony supported a finding that the supplement the officer consumed was an immediate precursor to a controlled substance, the police officer tested positive for a controlled substance, and that positive drug test constituted a violation of the departmental policy that merited termination. Thus, the commission rendered an arbitrary and capricious decision by substituting its judgment for the rules and policies of the police department. Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of the Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 571 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2020).

          Although a county civil service merit board was required to transmit its final decision as part of the administrative record, there was no question that the board rendered a final decision subject to appellate review, and that the lower court had before it all relevant information pertaining to that decision; the court of appeals therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, and the dispute, which was a narrow one of pure law, could be resolved without a remand.

          Police department's termination of an officer's employment was appropriate because substantial evidence supported the administrative law judge's finding that the officer violated police department policies by falsely arresting an individual and by operating a police vehicle recklessly in response to emergency calls. These violations warranted the termination of the officer's employment because, despite previous disciplinary actions and opportunities for improvement, the officer continued to exhibit reckless and dangerous behavior.

          County was not entitled to set aside an agreed assessment order because the county failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the county assessor did not approve of the agreed order or give a Tennessee Division of Property attorney permission to sign the order on behalf of the taxpayer's counsel and the assessor. The judge found that the assessor was aware of the pending settlement, engaged in negotiations, received the agreed order after it was entered, and made no written objection until after the settlement was certified as final.

          Co-owner of a mobile home lacked standing to contest the forfeiture of currency that was properly seized as proceeds from drug trafficking during a search of the mobile home, which was leased to the co-owner's adult child, because the co-owner failed to demonstrate an ownership interest in the currency. The trial court's application of an incorrect standard of review was harmless error as, under the correct standard of review, the evidence preponderated in favor of the administrative law judge's determination that the co-owner lacked standing.

          When a state agency issues a citation to a person, local governmental entity, board or commission for the violation of a rule, regulation or statute and such citation results in a contested case hearing, at the conclusion of such hearing, the hearing officer or administrative law judge may order such agency to pay to the party issued a citation the amount of reasonable expenses incurred because of such citation, including a reasonable attorney's fee, if such officer or judge finds that the citation was issued:

          Attorney's fees could be awarded to a cited party if the citation was not well grounded in fact and not warranted by existing law. Am. Child Care v. State, 83 S.W.3d 148, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 909 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).
         </p>
         <p>
          Chancery court properly dismissed an owner's petition for judicial review of the forfeiture his vehicle because his case was moot where the vehicle had been returned to him, and the owner waived the issue of attorney fees by failing to raise it in his petition for judicial review, and such an award was not statutorily authorized where the only document sent to the owner was a notice that a forfeiture warrant had been issued for the vehicle, not a “a citation” for “the violation of a rule, regulation or statute” Groves v. Tenn. Dep't of Safety & Homeland Sec., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 703 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2018).
         </p>
         <p>
          Chancery court erred in awarding the claimants'  request for attorney's fees because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition where more than 60 days had passed from the day the order granting the motion to dismiss became final, no stay was granted, the initial order did not specify a later date for finality, and, while the administrative law judge's failure to address the claimants'  requested an award of attorney's fees constituted an error arising from oversight or omission, the ALJ's entry of the corrected order did not commence a new 60-day time period for the filing of a petition for judicial review. Berlanga v. Tenn. Dep't of Safety & Homeland Sec., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 48 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court did not err in awarding a physician assistant attorney fees and costs because the facts were not sufficient for the Department of Health to charge Sparks with a violation; the Physician Assistants Act does not include a requirement that a supervising physician be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the statutes governing health-related boards require them to give notice of changes in the applicable laws prior to bringing charges for enforcement. Tenn. Dep't of Health v. Sparks, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 439 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 6, 2019), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (Tenn. Jan. 15, 2020).

      In addition to the insertion of “for a full term” in (d)(2), Acts 1997, ch. 529 also purported, in § 1, to substitute “the Tennessee County Services Association and the Tennessee Municipal League, respectively” for “their respective state associations” in (a)(1). However, the affected language no longer appeared in this section, due to a prior amendment by Acts 1997, ch. 482, and so the amendment by Acts 1997, ch. 529, § 1 is deemed to be of no effect.

         The credit would be allowed to any shipper that establishes and implements a turn-around policy pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) against the sum total of the franchise and excise taxes owed by the shipper, equal to two percent (2%) of qualified transportation expenditures;

         The general assembly finds and declares that property tax incentives, resulting from legal ownership of valuable business or commercial properties by local governments or their agencies under various statutory programs, has served to promote economic development, but confusion and nonuniformity in structuring such incentives have led to uncertainty in determining property tax liability of new investment prospects. It is the intent of this part to provide for state and local review of property tax incentives for economic development. It is not the intent of this part to authorize new property tax incentives beyond those authorized by law on January 1, 1993.

       A judge who impartially applies state anti-discrimination law, as written and enacted by the General Assembly, is fulfilling the judicial duty to “uphold and apply the law,” not manifesting bias or prejudice or engaging in harassment. Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10, Rule 2.3 does not, nor could it, prevent a judge from faithfully applying that law in a case before the court. Tenn. Sup. Ct.

Rule 3.6 is inapplicable to membership in religious organizations. OAG 18-17, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 16 (4/3/2018).

        Court properly ruled that the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA), T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., did not apply to the governor's rejection of judicial nominees because the governor had no authority to control, in any way, the manner and means by which judges performed their official duties, nor did the governor have the power to demote or terminate a state court judge; therefore, there was nothing weighing in favor of finding that nominees to fill a judicial vacancy were employees for purposes of the THRA. Bredesen v. Tenn. Judicial Selection Comm'n, 214 S.W.3d 419, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (Tenn. 2007).

        One of the purposes of title 4, chapter 21 is to prohibit discrimination in employment and not to restrict the employer's right to make bona fide business decisions. Bruce v. Western Auto Supply Co., 669 S.W.2d 95, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2871 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly granted the employer summary judgment on the employee's retaliation claim under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-301ol11" target="_self">4-21-301(1)</a></cite> (now §  <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-301ol1a1" target="_self">4-21-301(a)(1)</a></cite>), because even though the employee presented sufficient evidence for a prima facie case of retaliation, the employer articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employee's transfer, which the employee failed to show was pretextual; the employer contended that it transferred the employee to protect her from further harassment by her supervisor, which was one of the central purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101ol1a1" target="_self">4-21-101(a)(1)</a></cite>-(4).

        Since there was nothing in title 4, chapter 21 that would require retroactive application, the Tennessee human rights commission was without jurisdiction to investigate plaintiff's termination. Shultz v. Dempster Systems, Inc., 561 F. Supp. 1230, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17438 (E.D. Tenn. 1983).

        Analysis of plaintiff's age discrimination claim was the same under the Tennessee Human Rights Act as under federal law. Trentham v. K-Mart Corp., 806 F. Supp. 692, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20925 (E.D. Tenn. 1991), aff'd, 952 F.2d 403, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 3629 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1992).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff's employment discrimination claim under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>e(k) was denied because she failed to establish that she was treated any differently from nonpregnant employees, her claim under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., was dismissed since the analysis under the federal law would be the same under the state law. Mayberry v. Endocrinology-Diabetes Assocs., 926 F. Supp. 1315, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7588 (M.D. Tenn. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tennessee courts may look to federal interpretation of <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>a for guidance in enforcing Tennessee's anti-discrimination laws, but are neither bound nor limited by federal law when interpreting title 4, chapter 21. Phillips v. Interstate Hotels Corp. #L07, 974 S.W.2d 680, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 350 (Tenn. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        An analysis of a plaintiff's claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, title 4, chapter 21 is identical to that under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>e. Davis v. Modine Mfg. Co., 979 S.W.2d 602, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. 1998).

        In contrast to the Tennessee Human Rights Act, an employee may still violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 12101</cite> et seq. if the employee can perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation. Workman v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 165 F.3d 460, 1999 FED App. 17P, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 478 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1999).

        Tennessee courts may appropriately look to decisions of federal courts construing Title VII, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>e et seq., when analyzing claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq.; these federal precedents do not, however, bind or limit Tennessee's courts in giving the fullest possible effect to Tennessee's own human rights legislation. Spann v. Abraham, 36 S.W.3d 452, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 746 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).

        For both Age Discrimination in Employment Act, <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 621</cite> et seq. and Title VII, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>e et seq., claims, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> provides that Tennessee is a “deferral state” that prohibits discrimination in employment based on age or race, and authorizes a state authority to grant relief. Casillas v. Fed. Express Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d 875, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6161, 177 A.L.R. Fed. 763 (W.D. Tenn. 2001).

Knoxville Utils. Bd., 259 F.3d 452, 2001 FED App. 246P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 16932 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2001).

       <p>
        Tennessee courts have looked to federal case law applying the provisions of the federal anti-discrimination statutes as the baseline for interpreting and applying the Tennessee Human Rights Act, compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq.Newman v.

        Because a bankruptcy debtor had knowledge of her discrimination claim when she filed for bankruptcy, a motive to conceal the claim, and failed to offer any evidence from which the court could infer a lack of intent to conceal, the court found that her omission was intentional and she was judicially estopped from pursuing her discrimination claim under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite>. Tyler v. Fed. Express Corp., 420 F. Supp. 2d 849, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41409 (W.D. Tenn. 2005), aff'd, — F.3d —, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 28626 (6th Cir. 2006).

        In an action for hostile work environment discrimination on the basis of race, African-American employees submitted affidavits adequately based on their personal knowledge, as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), when they made statements about specific racial slurs that were directed toward them, racial graffiti that they had themselves observed, the complaints that they made to their employer, and the actions that the employer subsequently took, and it was not necessary that the affidavits set forth every conceivable detail that opposing counsel could imagine.

        Dismissal of a claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4334, was proper because, for an individual to sustain an action against a state pursuant to USERRA, the action must have been permitted by state law, and the Tennessee general assembly had not passed legislation to expressly waive its sovereign immunity from claims based on USERRA; appellant's claim that the state of Tennessee had impliedly waived its immunity from USERRA claims by expressly waiving its immunity from claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., and the Tennessee Disability Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c50s8-50-103ol1a" target="_blank">8-50-103(a)</a></cite>, was misplaced because any such waiver had to be made in plain, clear, and unmistakable terms. The Tennessee National Guard was a division of the Tennessee Military Department, and thus was an entity of Tennessee, and accordingly, the Tennessee National Guard had immunity from claims arising under the USERRA.

        Employee failed to establish a failure to promote claim where the job that he had sought would not have been a promotion, but simply a lateral transfer, the employee had not established a foundation to show that the employer's reasons for denying him the new position were a pretext for age discrimination, the only evidence in the record that could be considered probative was a single statement by a manager that higher-level managers preferred younger workers because they were go-getters, and that single piece of indirect evidence, which was probably hearsay, was too weak a foundation to support a verdict in the employee's favor.

        Where an employee allegedly was terminated for poor performance as part of a reduction in force, the employee's age discrimination claims failed because the employee did not present direct evidence of discrimination based on statements regarding older employees or evidence sufficient to show that the proffered explanation for the employee's discharge was pretextual.

        In a case in which plaintiff sued a county board of education on the grounds of age discrimination and retaliation, the appellate court concluded that plaintiff identified and produced evidence to establish a prima facie case for both claims and to create a genuine issue of fact concerning whether the board's stated reasons for its actions were pretexts for discriminatory or retaliatory animus. Because facts material to the board's defense were disputed and a trier of fact could find that the reasons for lateral transferring plaintiff from a bookkeeping position to a teacher's aid position were pretextual, summary dismissal was not appropriate.

        As the city produced evidence to show a non-discriminatory reason for the employee's termination, the presumption of discrimination dropped away and the employee had to prove pretext, which he failed to do; the trial court did not err in deciding not to infer discriminatory intent from a council member's isolated statement and the evidence showed the city was concerned it could not afford salaries of employees with seniority. Argument that the desire to save money on salary costs was a proxy for age discrimination had been rejected by courts. Wallace v. City of Lewisburg, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 485 (Tenn. Ct.

        When African-American employees complained about the use of the terms “boy” and “damn it boy” toward them at work and the use of the terms increased, not decreased, after management implemented an anti-harassment policy, the employees could maintain an action against their employer for racial discrimination; regardless of whether the terms “boy” and “damn it boy” were a Southern thing, as the employer's attorney suggested when he investigated the employees'  complaints, the language was offensive under the circumstances and persisted after coworkers were told why those terms could be offensive.

        Reasonable jury could have found, under the facts of the case, that the employee's reassignment was materially adverse because it, in essence, changed her status from being one of the team to being a problem to be dealt with; the adversity presented by this development was particularly acute, given the communal nature and the demands of the firehouse environment. As a reasonable jury could have concluded that this situation significantly exceeded a mere inconvenience or a trivial benefit reduction, the employer was not entitled to post-trial relief based on the argument that the employee did not suffer a materially adverse employment action; the policy guaranteed the employee's similarly-situated male peers a level of privacy and comfort that the employee could not expect and for these reasons, the employer was not entitled to post-trial relief based upon the argument that the employee was treated no differently than similar-situated male employees.

        Employer was properly granted summary judgment in employee's age and sex discrimination action filed under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., because the employee submitted insufficient evidence to establish the fourth element of his prima facie case, that he was either replaced by an employee outside the protected class or that he was treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside the protected class; the only evidence in the record indicating that a younger female employee replaced the employee was a record showing that her first loan was processed one month after the employee was terminated.

       Attorney General Opinions. A judge who impartially applies state anti-discrimination law, as written and enacted by the General Assembly, is fulfilling the judicial duty to “uphold and apply the law,” not manifesting bias or prejudice or engaging in harassment. Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10, Rule 2.3 does not, nor could it, prevent a judge from faithfully applying that law in a case before the court. Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 10, Rule 3.6 does not establish a religious test that excludes from office members of any religious organization, including ones that disapprove of or condemn homosexuality. Rule 3.6 is inapplicable to membership in religious organizations. OAG 18-17, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 16 (4/3/2018).

       <p>
        The term “agent” within the definition of “employer” does not include an employee or supervisor and, thus, the Human Rights Act, compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., did not allow a supervisor to be sued in his individual capacity in an action against an employer and the supervisor alleging sexual harassment. Burnett v. Tyco Corp., 932 F. Supp. 1039, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10517 (W.D. Tenn. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The “agent of an employer” language in the definition of “employer” does not impose individual liability. Carr v. UPS, 955 S.W.2d 832, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 511 (Tenn. 1997), overruled in part, Parker v. Warren County Util. Dist., 2 S.W.3d 170, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 419 (Tenn. 1999), overruled in part, Reagan v. City of Knoxville, 692 F. Supp. 2d 891, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11616 (E.D. Tenn. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        State judge's actions, if proven to constitute quid pro quo sexual harassment of county employee under the judge's supervision, could be imputed to the state, since it empowered the judge with the authority the judge allegedly abused in an attempt to gain sexual favors. Sanders v. Lanier, 968 S.W.2d 787, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (Tenn. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the county employee was not deemed to have been plaintiff's employer, he could be found liable in his individual capacity if he were proven to have aided, abetted, incited, compelled or commanded a person to engage in a discriminatory act or practice; while plaintiff's complaint did not track this particular language, she did allege that he oversaw the creation and maintenance of a racially discriminatory hiring and promotion policy.

        Cancer is an illness that may be perceived or regarded as limiting a major life activity in a substantial manner and thus qualifies as a “handicap” under the statutory definition. Forbes v. Wilson County Emergency Dist. 911 Bd., 966 S.W.2d 417, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (Tenn. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appropriate framework for analyzing a handicap discrimination claim under the Tennessee Handicap Act (THA) (now the Tennessee Disability Act), codified in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c50s8-50-103" target="_blank">8-50-103</a></cite>, and the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA), compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., is that the claimant must: (1) Establish qualification as an individual with a disability; (2) Show the ability to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) Show subjection to an adverse employment action on the basis of a protected disability. Barnes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 48 S.W.3d 698, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of handicap includes individuals perceived or “regarded” as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; thus, while the impairment may not have substantially limited a major life activity, the plaintiff may be regarded as disabled if the defendant treated the plaintiff as if the impairment substantially limited a major life activity. Barnes v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 48 S.W.3d 698, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee did not have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited a major life activity because the employee, by his own testimony and that of his treating physician, acknowledged that the employee had fully recovered from his most recent surgery within three to four months. Moreover, the employee admitted that when the employer made its decision to place him on leave he felt “great” and was ready to work. Bennett v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 315 S.W.3d 832, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 299 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2009), appeal denied, Bennett v. Nissan North Am., Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 812 (Tenn. Nov. 23, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer presented sufficient evidence to negate that the employee was “qualified” for the position because, while the employee's restrictions did not exceed the essential functions of the job, the employer showed that the employee's injuries had increased in frequency and severity over the course of his employment. Bennett v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 315 S.W.3d 832, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 299 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2009), appeal denied, Bennett v. Nissan North Am., Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 812 (Tenn. Nov. 23, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question of material fact existed as to whether the employer regarded the employee as substantially limited in the major life activity of working because the employer thought that the employee could not or at least should not continue working in “automobile production manufacturing” or in “repetitive heavy industry.” Bennett v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 315 S.W.3d 832, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 299 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2009), appeal denied, Bennett v. Nissan North Am., Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 812 (Tenn. Nov. 23, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an atypical regarded-as discrimination case in that the purported source of the physical restrictions the employer imposed on the employee was a state-court order rather than the employer's own conclusions about the employee's capabilities, the central issue was the legitimacy of the nondiscriminatory reason offered by the employer for its actions, that it relied on the order of the workers'  compensation chancellor. This defense failed as a matter of law because as a matter of law and fact, the order did not require that the employer take the actions it took; there was no genuine issue whether the employer independently assessed the employee's physical capabilities; and there was no genuine issue whether the employer made the reasonable assessment and inquiry required to assert an honest-belief defense. No reasonable jury could conclude that the employer had an honest belief based on a reasonably informed and considered decision that the chancellor ordered the employer to impose restrictions on the employee such that he could no longer do the job the chancellor found he was able to do and assumed he would continue doing. Jones v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 2011 FED App. 0582N, 438 Fed. Appx. 388, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 17412, 2011 FED App. 582N (6th Cir.).

        Employee failed to state a claim against the employer under the Tennessee Human Rights Act because the employee failed to show that he engaged in a protected activity or fell within a protected class, and the employee had not alleged a discriminatory practice by the employer in the complaint or that the employer retaliated or discriminated against him for opposing or interacting in any fashion with such a practice.

        Hotel lounge that served alcohol and provided a meeting place to socialize and dance satisfied the definition of a place of public accommodation. Phillips v. Interstate Hotels Corp. #L07, 974 S.W.2d 680, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 350 (Tenn. 1998).

        While the impairment may not have substantially limited a major life activity, the plaintiff may be regarded as disabled if the defendant treated the plaintiff as if the impairment substantially limited a major life activity. Barnes v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 48 S.W.3d 698, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Some adverse employment actions are: (1) Termination of employment; (2) Demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, by a less distinguished title, or by a material loss of employment benefits; or (3) A significant reduction of material responsibilities. Barnes v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 48 S.W.3d 698, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A record of absenteeism may be irrelevant when addressing an ongoing qualification to perform a specific job; in determining whether an individual is a “qualified individual,” courts may look to whether the level of unscheduled absenteeism was detrimental to the employer's consideration. Barnes v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 48 S.W.3d 698, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. 2000).

        The claimant can establish discrimination on the basis of a protected disability under either a direct evidence method or an indirect evidence method; the former entitles the claimant to judgment unless the employer shows that an impermissible motive did not play a role in the employment decisions.

       <p>
        Dismissal of a claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4334, was proper because, for an individual to sustain an action against a state pursuant to USERRA, the action must have been permitted by state law, and the Tennessee general assembly had not passed legislation to expressly waive its sovereign immunity from claims based on USERRA; appellant's claim that the state of Tennessee had impliedly waived its immunity from USERRA claims by expressly waiving its immunity from claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., and the Tennessee Disability Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c50s8-50-103ol1a" target="_blank">8-50-103(a)</a></cite>, was misplaced because any such waiver had to be made in plain, clear, and unmistakable terms. The Tennessee National Guard was a division of the Tennessee Military Department, and thus was an entity of Tennessee, and accordingly, the Tennessee National Guard had immunity from claims arising under the USERRA. Smith v. Tenn. Nat'l Guard, 387 S.W.3d 570, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 552 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 871 (Tenn.

        Appellate court erred in holding that the Governmental Tort Liability Act (GTLA) applied to a former police chief's age-discrimination claims against a city under the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA) because the THRA evinced an unmistakable legislative intent to remove whatever immunity a governmental entity might have had under the GTLA, the THRA clearly established a right to trial by jury on THRA claims filed in chancery court.

        Acts 1993, ch. 307, § 4 provided that the rule of the state human rights commission concerning sexual harassment be published as a permanent note under this chapter. This rule, which is presently printed as 29 CFR 1604.11, effective July 20, 1992, as amended by 64 FR 58333, 58334, Oct. 29, 1999, is as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        “§ 1604.11 Sexual Harassment.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a)  Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of section 703 of title VII. n1 Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1)  The principles involved here continue to apply to race, color, religion or national origin.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b)  In determining whether alleged conduct constitutes sexual harassment, the Commission will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred. The determination of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts, on a case by case basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c)  [Reserved]
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d)  With respect to conduct between fellow employees, an employer is responsible for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e)  An employer may also be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with respect to sexual harassment of employees in the workplace, where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing these cases the Commission will consider the extent of the employer's control and any other legal responsibility which the employer may have with respect to the conduct of such non-employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(f)  Prevention is the best tool for the elimination of sexual harassment. An employer should take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as affirmatively raising the subject, expressing strong disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment under title VII, and developing methods to sensitize all concerned.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(g)  Other related practices: Where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an individual's submission to the employer's sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied that employment opportunity or benefit.”

          It is possible that some contractual right might accrue to an employee as the result of an unlawful termination of a contract of employment. Without a clear contract under which such rights may vest, however, employees in Tennessee possess no property right in their employment. Bennett v.

          A contract of employment for a definite term may not be terminated before the end of the term, except for good cause or by mutual agreement, unless the right to do so is reserved in the contract. Bennett v. Steiner-Liff Iron & Metal Co., 826 S.W.2d 119, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 204 (Tenn. 1992).

          This provision is integrally connected to the types of discrimination the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., has specifically forbidden, and marital status is not included in the list of forbidden employment classifications.

          Although an employee established prima facie case of race and age discrimination as to one promotion the employee was not awarded, the employer had a legitimate reason, an agreement with a union, for placing another employee in the position, and the employee failed to show that the reason was pretextual, and as to other promotions, no prima facie case of discrimination was shown because the employee was not qualified for the positions in the first place. Anthony v. BTR Auto. Sealing Sys., 339 F.3d 506, 2003 FED App. 278P, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 16264 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2003).

          Police officers' subjective interpretation of their transfer and demotion did not prove that the city manager's reason for the action, his belief that they could not work cohesively under the supervision of a new head of detectives, was pretextual. Miller v. City of Murfreesboro, 122 S.W.3d 766, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 482 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 1269 (Tenn. 2003).

          In a retaliation case, attorney fee award to plaintiff was proper under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-401" target="_self">4-21-401</a></cite> et seq., where the jury clearly found that plaintiff was retaliated against for complaining about sexual harassment. Emerson v. Oak Ridge Research, Inc., 187 S.W.3d 364, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 637 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 224 (Tenn. 2006).
         </p>
         <p>
          In this Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and Tennessee Human Rights Act action, the employee had shown a close enough temporal connection between her charge of discrimination and the beginning of the retaliatory conduct to permit a jury to make the inference that the employee's replacement's retaliatory actions were caused by the employee's complaints. Reed v. Am. Cellular, Inc., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112163 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 8, 2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Court of Appeals erred in reversing a trial court's denial of an employer's motion for a new trial and/or a remittitur because the jury could infer that a supervisor knew that an employee had filed a lawsuit for discrimination under federal and state laws based on the employee's Japanese-American heritage where the supervisor ordered the employee to do tasks that required physical labor beyond his medical restrictions less than a week after the employer was served with his lawsuit. Ferguson v. Middle Tenn. State Univ., 451 S.W.3d 375, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 898 (Tenn. Oct. 29, 2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Sufficient evidence supported an employee's retaliation claim because the employee's direct evidence showed the employee was not promoted for having engaged in the protected activity of previously suing the employer for racial discrimination. Goree v. UPS, 490 S.W.3d 413, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 828 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 189 (Tenn. Mar. 23, 2016).
         </p>
         <p>
          Insufficient evidence supported an employee's retaliation claim based on a demotion because the employee did not show the employee was demoted for engaging in a protected activity, as (1) the employee's grievances unrelated to discrimination did not support such a claim, and (2) the employee did not show the employee's advocacy in favor of another employee who was retaliated against supported the claim. Goree v. UPS, 490 S.W.3d 413, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 828 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 189 (Tenn. Mar. 23, 2016).

          </span>
         </h4>
         <p>
          In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, plaintiff must prove: plaintiff engaged in a protected activity; the exercise of plaintiff's protected civil rights was known to defendant; defendant thereafter took an employment action adverse to plaintiff; and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Newsom v. Textron Aerostructures, 924 S.W.2d 87, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 681 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).
         </p>
         <p>
          In an action alleging discharge in retaliation for plaintiff's filing an age discrimination lawsuit, where there was no evidence that created a factual dispute as to whether defendant's stated discharge grounds were merely a pretext for terminating defendant, grant of summary judgment was proper. Newsom v. Textron Aerostructures, 924 S.W.2d 87, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 681 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).
         </p>

          Former employee's claim of retaliation based on race pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Tennessee Human Rights Act, and <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1981</cite> failed because: (1) His former employer had a factual basis for termination since its investigation revealed evidence to support its conclusion the employee likely committed time card fraud; and (2), The employee had not come forth with any evidence that showed that the employer's belief that time card fraud had been committed did not motivate its decision to terminate him; thus, the employe did not show pretext for his termination. Crum v. Tyson Fresh Meats, 390 F. Supp. 2d 658, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29804 (M.D. Tenn. 2005).

          African-American former employee's claim of retaliatory discharge against his former employer under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-301" target="_self">4-21-301</a></cite> was dismissed because the employee failed to allege that he engaged in protected activity prior to his termination, or that there was a causal connection between his engagement in protected activity and his termination. Person v. Progressive Logistics Servs. LLC, 418 F. Supp. 2d 1006, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12981 (E.D. Tenn. 2006).
         </p>
         <p>
          Employee's altered working conditions were comparable to those at the hospital and in no way difficult or unpleasant; because the employee's transfer did not amount to an adverse employment action, the trial court did not err in dismissing the employee and her husband's retaliation claim. Frye v. St. Thomas Health Servs., 227 S.W.3d 595, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 151 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007).
         </p>
         <p>
          Year-long interval between plaintiff's complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and plaintiff's termination, coupled with the lack of other compelling evidence indicating retaliation, was an insufficient showing of causal connection to make out a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-301" target="_self">4-21-301</a></cite> et seq.Tolliver v. Children's Home-Chambliss Shelter, 784 F. Supp. 2d 893, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32553 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 28, 2011).
         </p>
         <p>
          Former employer's motion for summary judgment was granted in a former employee's suit for retaliation in violation of Title VII, <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 2000</cite>e-3(a), and the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-301" target="_self">4-21-301</a></cite>, because she failed to establish that she engaged in a protected activity and merely relied upon her quid pro quo sexual harassment claims, without additional evidence that she engaged in any protected participation or opposition activity. Nolan v. Indus. Sorting Servs., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69808 (E.D. Tenn. May 18, 2012).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court properly dismissed an employee's retaliation claim against a hospital under the Tennessee Human Rights Act because the evidence supported its findings that the vice-president was the ultimate decision-maker and that she was unaware that the employee participated in a human resource investigation of a supervisor when she decided to fire the employee; the vice-president and the employee testified that the employee never told the supervisor she participated in the investigation. Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2018).
         </p>
         <p>
          Employee failed to establish a causal connection between her participation in the investigation of a supervisor and her termination because the record was replete with evidence of the employee's insubordination and refusal to perform her job requirements; the employee's belief that she was being retaliated against was not sufficient to establish causation, and the trial court was free to credit the testimony of the hospital's witnesses. Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2018).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court did not commit reversible error in failing to include the totality of a human resources investigation of a supervisor and testimony concerning specific instances of conduct related to the investigation because the employee failed to establish that the vice-president knew that she participated in the investigation when the employee was terminated; therefore, the details of the report had very little, if any, relevance to the employee's Tennessee Human Rights Act claim. Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2018).
         </p>
         <p>
          Because the trial court made findings that spanned eight pages of transcript concerning the causation element of the Tennessee Human Rights Act alone, the employee's contention that the trial court did not make sufficient findings to support its conclusion that she failed to establish that her termination was causally linked to her participation in the human resources investigation of a supervisor was without merit. Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2018).

          Whether a retaliatory discharge claim is brought pursuant to title 4, chapter 21 or under federal law, a plaintiff must prove the same four elements: (1) That the plaintiff engaged in an activity protected by the statute; (2) That the defendant had knowledge of the plaintiff's exercise of protected activity; (3) That the defendant thereafter took an employment action adverse to the plaintiff; and (4) That a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Austin v. Shelby County Gov't, 3 S.W.3d 474, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 128 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
         </p>
         <p>
          To make the determination of whether a causal link between an employee's protected activity and the adverse employment action exists, courts consider whether an employer's conduct can be linked to retaliatory intent, and temporal proximity of the adverse action to the complaint, a pattern of antagonism following a complaint, or other circumstantial evidence supporting causation are all relevant to a determination of causation; a majority of circuits have held that proof of close temporal proximity alone can establish causation, at least for purposes of stating a prima facie case, and the supreme court of Tennessee adopted the majority rule and held that close temporal proximity of a complaint and a materially adverse action are sufficient to establish a prima facie case of causation.

          Both the anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination by an employer, because given the similarity of the prohibitions, if severe and pervasive harassment by a supervisor constitutes discrimination under the anti-discrimination statute, then it should also be sufficient to constitute discrimination under the anti-retaliation statute; because Faragher and Ellerth held that an employer is vicariously liable for a supervisor's violation of the anti-discrimination statute, an employer should also be vicariously liable for similar conduct when it violates the anti-retaliation statute, and therefore an employer may be held vicariously liable when the retaliation takes the form of severe and pervasive harassment by a supervisor.

          Tennessee law provides three ways in which a victim of alleged employment discrimination may proceed; first of all, he may file administratively through the Tennessee human rights commission, which filing must be done within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act; if the victim chooses the administrative route, the second way to proceed would follow the final decision of the commission, which would be to file a complaint with the chancery court to review the decision of the administrative agency; and the third way to proceed is to file a direct action in the chancery court.

         <p>
          From the billing records, the affidavits, and the employer's failure to object to the employee's fee request, there was every indication that the time spent by counsel was reasonable under the circumstances and that the hourly rate was reasonable as well; additionally, while the employee was not successful on every claim asserted in the complaint, the employee achieved excellent results, in that the jury found in her favor on the key issue in the case, that is, whether the employer discriminated against her through its policies. Therefore, the employee was awarded the requested amount of attorneys'  fees. Stuart v. Metro. Gov't, 679 F. Supp. 2d 851, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118620 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 21, 2009).

          Remittitur of an employee's humiliation and embarrassment award for a discriminatory failure to promote was properly suggested because the employee did not show aggravating circumstances.

          It was error to suggest remittitur as to an employee's award of future pay for a discriminatory failure to promote because the award was in line with evidence of (1) what the employee would have earned had the promotion not been denied, and (2) the length of time the employee planned to continue working.

          Tennessee law provides three ways in which a victim of alleged employment discrimination may proceed; first of all, he may file administratively through the Tennessee human rights commission, which filing must be done within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act; if the victim chooses the administrative route, the second way to proceed would follow the final decision of the commission, which would be to file a complaint with the chancery court to review the decision of the administrative agency under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-307" target="_self">4-21-307</a></cite>; and the third way to proceed is to file a direct action in the chancery court.

          The anti-discrimination act forces an election between the administrative and judicial remedy, at least where an aggrieved individual has initiated the administrative process and pursued it to an administrative conclusion; once the administrative process has been pursued past the initial administrative conclusion that no actionable violation exists, the only way to get to court is through an administrative appeal.

          City employee's Tennessee Human Rights Act claim was dismissed because the employee's election to obtain a final order from the Tennessee Human Rights Commission (THRC) on the merits prevented him from bringing an original action in any court, and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review administrative orders of the THRC.

          Tennessee law provides three ways in which a victim of alleged employment discrimination may proceed; first of all, he may file administratively through the Tennessee human rights commission, which filing must be done within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act; if the victim chooses the administrative route, the second way to proceed would follow the final decision of the commission, which would be to file a complaint with the chancery court to review the decision of the administrative agency; the third way to proceed is to file a direct action in the chancery court under this section. Hoge v. Roy H. Park Broadcasting, Inc., 673 S.W.2d 157, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3403 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

          An action alleging age discrimination in employment that was filed as a direct action in the chancery court under this section, was an action alleging in substance a federal civil rights statutory violation, and the statute of limitations in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_blank">28-3-104</a></cite> applied, rather than either the limitations in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-302" target="_self">4-21-302</a></cite> or the general limitations in the federal act. Hoge v. Roy H. Park Broadcasting, Inc., 673 S.W.2d 157, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3403 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where the substance of the complaint alleges a federal civil rights statutory violation, Tennessee's general statute of limitations for actions brought in state courts, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_blank">28-3-104</a></cite>, is applicable in the absence of a specific statute of limitation.

Puckett v. Tennessee Eastman Co., 889 F.2d 1481, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 16584 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1989).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where plaintiff brought her claim by the administrative route set forth in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-302" target="_self">4-21-302</a></cite>, followed it through to the conciliation stage, and did not file a complaint in circuit court until after expiration of the limitations period, the court action was barred.

         </p>
         <p>
          Claimants who pursued a judicial action, like those who chose to pursue an administrative complaint, enjoyed the remedies enumerated in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-306" target="_self">4-21-306</a></cite>. England v. Fleetguard, Inc., 878 F. Supp. 1058, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3048 (M.D. Tenn. 1995).

          The one year limitations period for bringing a direct court action under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-311" target="_self">4-21-311</a></cite> was not tolled during the pendency of administrative charges filed with the Tennessee Human Rights Commission. Burnett v. Tyco Corp., 932 F. Supp. 1039, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10517 (W.D. Tenn. 1996).
         </p>
         <p>
          The one-year limitations period for claims of discriminatory practice and retaliatory discharge commenced when plaintiff received oral notice of defendant's decision to terminate his contract, not from the date he was provided written notice of the decision in accordance with his employment agreement. Weber v. Moses, 938 S.W.2d 387, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 810 (Tenn. 1996).
         </p>
         <p>
          Application of the “continuing violation” theory was justified where plaintiff was able to show that a particular demotion that was within the limitations period was linked to a series of related discriminatory acts. Frazier v. Heritage Fed. Bank for Sav., 955 S.W.2d 633, 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 323 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997).

         </p>
         <p>
          Promotion or hiring from an allegedly tainted promotions roster is not a “continuing act” for purposes of timely filing, but is merely the effect of previous discrimination. Cox v. City of Memphis, 230 F.3d 199, 2000 FED App. 370P, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 25942 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2000).

         <p>
          Because plaintiff failed to show that any acts of sexual harassment occurred within one year prior to date of filing, the plaintiff's state law claims for quid pro quo and hostile environment sexual harassment under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, compiled in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., were barred by the statute of limitations; however, plaintiff's claim of retaliation did fall within the limits of the continuing violation doctrine. Reed v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 133 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16302 (M.D. Tenn. 2000).

          To the extent a former employee sought recovery of discrete retaliatory or discriminatory acts under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., that occurred more than one year from the filing of the complaint, those claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Martin v. Boeing-Oak Ridge Co., 244 F. Supp. 2d 863, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25654 (E.D. Tenn. 2002).

Cline v. BWXT Y-12, LLC, 521 F.3d 507, 2008 FED App. 133P, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 6829 (6th Cir. Apr. 1, 2008).

Gibson-Holmes v. Fifth Third Bank, 661 F. Supp. 2d 905, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92155 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 2, 2009).

Conner v. City of Jackson, 669 F. Supp. 2d 886,  2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112545 (W.D. Tenn. June 9, 2009).

Fite v. Nashville, 686 F. Supp. 2d 735, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14860 (M.D. Tenn. Feb. 19, 2010).

          Employee's race discrimination claims concerning denials of promotions were time-barred under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-311ol1d" target="_self">4-21-311(d)</a></cite> because the employee's complaint was filed more than one year after the last alleged discriminatory act occurred; the doctrine of continuing violations did not apply because no alleged discriminatory conduct occurred within the one year limitations period. Nicholson v. City of Clarksville, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115307 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 5, 2011).
         </p>
         <p>
          In light of the fact that the focus for statute of limitations purposes was on the time of the discriminatory action, not the time at which the consequences of the action were most painful, the employee's Tennessee Human Rights Act claims against the employer were barred by the one-year statute of limitations because the alleged retaliation and failure to take remedial action occurred more than one year before the complaint was filed. Thurmer v. Charter Communs., LLC, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59713 (E.D. Tenn. Apr. 30, 2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Finding a drawing in the men's restroom at work was the kind of isolated, discrete discriminatory practice that was time-barred by the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA) where plaintiff informed management about the drawing, it was removed, and he did not connect this one act to any present discriminatory activity or show that the drawing was part of a longstanding and demonstrable policy of racial discrimination by defendant. Thus, this incident could not be used as a factual allegation underlying plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. Artis v. Finishing Brands Holdings, — F. Supp. 2d —,  2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34202 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 19, 2015), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, Artis v. Finishing, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 1509, 639 Fed. Appx. 313, 2016 FED App. 50N (6th Cir. Tenn. 2016).

          Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA) claims against municipalities have to be tried in a bench trial because: (1) the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act (GTLA) applies to suits against governmental entities unless the act specifically provides otherwise or is only applicable to governmental entities and provides its own remedy; (2) the THRA provides for suits to be brought in either chancery or circuit court but is silent as to whether claims have to be tried with or without a jury and whether the choice of venue provision specifically applies to claims against governmental entities in contravention of the GTLA; and (3) the GTLA provides that suits have to be brought in the circuit court without a jury.

          In a case in which plaintiff sued a county board of education on the grounds of age discrimination and retaliation, the appellate court concluded that plaintiff identified and produced evidence to establish a prima facie case for both claims and to create a genuine issue of fact concerning whether the board's stated reasons for its actions were pretexts for discriminatory or retaliatory animus. Because facts material to the board's defense were disputed and a trier of fact could find that the reasons for lateral transferring plaintiff from a bookkeeping position to a teacher's aid position were pretextual, summary dismissal was not appropriate.

          Regarding the race discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Tennessee Human Rights Act, there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that giving a white employee an unremarkable $1.00 raise upon becoming a full-time employee somehow reflected racial animus by the employer against the employee in choosing to deny her a 50% raise. Hawkins v. Ctr. for Spinal Surgery, — F. Supp. 2d —,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103400 (M.D. Tenn. July 29, 2014).
         </p>
         <p>
          Trial court properly dismissed an employee's retaliation claim against a hospital under the Tennessee Human Rights Act because the evidence supported its findings that the vice-president was the ultimate decision-maker and that she was unaware that the employee participated in a human resource investigation of a supervisor when she decided to fire the employee; the vice-president and the employee testified that the employee never told the supervisor she participated in the investigation. Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2018).
         </p>
         <p>
          Employee failed to establish a causal connection between her participation in the investigation of a supervisor and her termination because the record was replete with evidence of the employee's insubordination and refusal to perform her job requirements; the employee's belief that she was being retaliated against was not sufficient to establish causation, and the trial court was free to credit the testimony of the hospital's witnesses. Terry v. Jackson-Madison Cty. Gen. Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 372 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2018).

          Trial court did not err by granting the former employer summary judgment on the former employee's claim alleging discrimination because there was no genuine dispute that, due to her medical restrictions, the employee was unable to perform the essential job functions of a store manager, as she admitted that she could not perform the essential job function of frequent and proper lifting of up to 40 pounds and occasional lifting of up to 55 pounds.

           It is not a discriminatory practice for an employer to institute a policy in the employer's workplace requiring that all employees speak only in English at certain times when the employer has a legitimate business necessity for such a policy, including, but not limited to, the safe and efficient operation of the employer's business, and the employer provides notice to employees of the policy and the consequences of violating the policy.

           Pregnancy discrimination may be established by using either the direct method where a plaintiff may present enough evidence to demonstrate that the adverse employment action was the result of intentional discrimination; and the indirect method in which a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination by showing: (1) That she was pregnant; (2) That she was qualified for her job; (3) That she was subjected to an adverse employment decision; and (4) That there is a nexus between her pregnancy and the adverse employment decision by demonstrating that comparable non-pregnant employee received more favoarable treatment.

           If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of sex discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to show the action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason and the plaintiff must then show the alleged legitimate reason was only a pretext to the discriminatory animus behind the action. Raines v. Shoney's, Inc., 909 F. Supp. 1070, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19145 (E.D. Tenn. 1995).

           Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of university on professor's lawsuit alleging that university discriminated against him on the basis of national origin and religion where professor could not show that denial of his application for promotion was discriminatory because he could not show that he was qualified for such a promotion; record was insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether denial of release time from professor's teaching responsibilities was discriminatory.

           Because plaintiff employee presented evidence of the discriminatory race animus of defendant's personnel director and offered sufficient proof under the cat's paw rule to create genuine issues of fact as to intent and causation, such evidence was to be imputed to defendant employer on plaintiff's claim under Title VII and the Tennessee Human Rights Act. Thus, summary judgment on his claims was improper. Chattman v. Toho Tenax Am., Inc.,  2012 FED App. 0217P, 686 F.3d 339, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 14359 (6th Cir. July 13, 2012).

           It was undisputed that a final written warning made an employee of defendant employer ineligible for promotions or raises for a one-year period, and that before he was disciplined, plaintiff employee was eligible to be promoted. After the discipline, he was ineligible, and while it was disputed whether plaintiff would have received a promotion during that one-year period but for the warning, the relevant analysis was simply whether the terms of his employment adversely changed, and since they had, plaintiff established an adverse employment action for purposes of his prima facie case of race discrimination. Chattman v. Toho Tenax Am., Inc.,  2012 FED App. 0217P, 686 F.3d 339, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 14359 (6th Cir. July 13, 2012).

           Because two decision makers should have known, by the time they finished their investigation into a horseplay incident, that the white employee involved, at best, was exaggerating the severity of the horseplay and his injuries, and such knowledge eliminated the differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish plaintiff African-American employee's conduct from that of other others engaged in horseplay, plaintiff created a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether other similarly situated white employees were also similarly disciplined for engaging in horseplay. Chattman v. Toho Tenax Am., Inc.,  2012 FED App. 0217P, 686 F.3d 339, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 14359 (6th Cir. July 13, 2012).

           Once the plaintiff proves his prima facie case of age discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the employee's discharge. If the employer meets the burden of articulation, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason proffered by the employer was not its true reason but merely a pretext for discrimination. Cooley v. Carmike Cinemas, 25 F.3d 1325, 1994 FED App. 208P, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 14473 (6th Cir. 1994).

           Employer offered several reasons for not reappointing the employee to the position of head basketball coach, none of which were based on ageist or retaliatory motives; those reasons included the employee's performance during the previous basketball season, as well as his performance evaluation for the previous year. The employee did not come forward with evidence to show that the employer's reasons were pretextual; thus, the employee failed to satisfy his burden of proof of demonstrating age discrimination under <cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 623(a)</cite>, and the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-401ol1a" target="_self">4-21-401(a)</a></cite>, or retaliation under <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1981</cite>.

Chattman v. Toho Tenax Am., Inc., 686 F. Supp. 2d 754, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15486 (E.D. Tenn. Feb. 22, 2010).

           Employer was granted summary judgment on the employee's race discrimination claim under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_self">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., where: (1) Conclusory and subjective beliefs, devoid of factual support, were not enough to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding background circumstances; (2) The employee could not show that she was treated differently than a similarly-situated, non-protected employee; and (3) The employer cited the employee's poor performance and poor leadership at the times at issue in this case as the basis for the employee's termination from employment Treadwell v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 716 F. Supp. 2d 721, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63932 (W.D. Tenn. June 9, 2010), aff'd, 447 Fed. Appx. 676, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 23348, 2011 FED App. 774N (6th) Cir. Tenn. 2011).

           Because plaintiff employee presented a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether employees outside his protected class were not disciplined even though they engaged in similar horseplay to that which defendant employer contended motivated its discipline of plaintiff, plaintiff presented a genuine dispute over whether defendant's proffered justification was pretext for racial discrimination. Chattman v. Toho Tenax Am., Inc.,  2012 FED App. 0217P, 686 F.3d 339, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 14359 (6th Cir. July 13, 2012).
          </p>
          <p>
           On claims of racial discrimination under Title VII and under the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA), defendant set forth a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for promoting another candidate, based in part on her evaluation scores and seniority. Opinions of plaintiff's co-workers who had no direct involvement in the decision-making process, without more, did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff was the superior candidate. Artis v. Finishing Brands Holdings, — F. Supp. 2d —,  2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34202 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 19, 2015), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, Artis v. Finishing, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 1509, 639 Fed.

           Even though the employee was subjected to the “cold-shoulder” treatment because of her race or gender and such discriminatory conduct resulted in a hostile work environment, because the evidence did not show that the employer failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action, finding in favor of employer was warranted. Campbell v. Florida Steel Corp., 919 S.W.2d 26, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 148 (Tenn. 1996).
          </p>
          <p>
           To prevail on a hostile work environment claim in a sexual harassment case, an employee must assert and prove that: (1) The employee is a member of a protected class; (2) The employee was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) The harassment occurred because of the employee's gender; (4) The harassment affected a term, condition or privilege of employment; and (5) The employer knew, or should have known, of the harassment and failed to respond with prompt and appropriate corrective action. Davis v. Modine Mfg. Co., 979 S.W.2d 602, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. 1998).
          </p>
          <p>
           While an employee claimed a hostile work environment, none of the alleged incidents of harassment were race-based, and the employee failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether e-mails and conversations regarding the employee's work performance were objectively hostile and abuse so as to alter the terms, conditions, or privileges of the job; rather, the e-mails and conversations represented a continual documentation of errors made by the employee, and while the language of the e-mails could have been more delicate, insulting language was not sufficient to support a hostile work environment claim. McNeail-Tunstall v. Marsh USA, 307 F. Supp. 2d 955, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3661 (W.D. Tenn. 2004).
          </p>
          <p>
           Terminated employee's evidence was not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment where it amounted to six comments made over a period of six and a half years; although the employee found the comments to be inappropriate and unprofessional, the comments were not frequent, did not involve physically threatening or humiliating conduct, and most of the comments were not directed towards her. Day v. Krystal Co., 471 F. Supp. 2d 874, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5596 (E.D. Tenn. 2007).
          </p>
          <p>
           Even though the Faragher/Ellerth  affirmative defense was not affected by the supervisor's status as a proxy or alter ego of the employer, genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the employer established that defense, and therefore the trial court erred by granting the employer summary judgment on that ground on the employee's discrimination claim; because the supervisor was the final arbiter regarding sexual harassment complaints and the employer's policy failed to provide a method of removing him from the decision-making process in which he was the alleged harasser, a reasonable jury could conclude the complaint procedures were unreasonable as applied to the employee. Allen v. McPhee, 240 S.W.3d 803, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 1073 (Tenn. Dec. 4, 2007).
          </p>
          <p>
           Nothing in the record established that the supervisor treated age-protected employees any differently than non-protected employees, but rather the testimony clearly showed that the supervisor was an equal opportunity oppressor, using supervisor's intense, dominant, abrupt, rude, and hard-nosed management style on all the hospital's employees; thus, there was no evidence of discriminatory conduct, and accordingly the trial court properly granted the hospital's and related persons'  and entities'  motion for summary judgment on the employee and her husband's hostile work environment claim. Frye v. St. Thomas Health Servs., 227 S.W.3d 595, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 151 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007).
          </p>
          <p>
           Allegations that a supervisor groped himself in front of three female employees, rubbed up against them, and made repeated sexual remarks and gestures stated a prima facie case for sexual harassment that survived a motion for summary judgment, particularly in light of the fact the employer was not entitled to a Faragher/Ellerth defense. Nesbitt v. Wilkins Tipton, P.A., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115407 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 16, 2012).
          </p>
          <p>
           Isolated racial comments made by a supervisor, while offensive, were insufficient to create a hostile work environment; the incidents amount to mere offensive utterances that were not actionable. Nesbitt v. Wilkins Tipton, P.A., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115407 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 16, 2012).

           Plaintiff employee firefighter's hostile-work-environment claim against defendant city employer failed as an anonymous “KKK” carving on a bathroom was an isolated incident and it did not alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment, and further, the city immediately removed the carving after it was reported. Jones v. City of Franklin, 468 Fed. Appx. 557, — F.3d —, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 6495, 2012 FED App. 343N (6th Cir.) (6th Cir. Tenn. 2012).
          </p>
          <p>
           Hostile work environment claim survived summary judgment because supervisor's conduct and comments to employee regarding her uniform were gender-based and employee had shown evidence she was target of repeated physical and daily verbal harassment by department supervisor.

          </p>
          <p>
           Finding a drawing in the men's restroom at work was the kind of isolated, discrete discriminatory practice that was time-barred by the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA) where plaintiff informed management about the drawing, it was removed, and he did not connect this one act to any present discriminatory activity or show that the drawing was part of a longstanding and demonstrable policy of racial discrimination by defendant. Thus, this incident could not be used as a factual allegation underlying plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. Artis v. Finishing Brands Holdings, — F. Supp. 2d —,  2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34202 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 19, 2015), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, Artis v. Finishing, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 1509, 639 Fed. Appx. 313, 2016 FED App. 50N (6th Cir. Tenn. 2016).

          <p>
           Plaintiff's Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA) racially hostile work environment claim failed, as he did not show that the alleged harassment was severe or pervasive. While a rubber chicken hanging from a noose was offensive, it was never seen again after it was taken down, and other behavior did not rise to the level of conduct that was physically threatening or humiliating.

           Employer was granted summary judgment as to the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. 4-21-101 et seq., pregnancy discrimination claim because the temporal relationship between the employer's knowledge of the employee's pregnancy and the adverse employment action was not sufficient to warrant an inference of retaliation; the employer knew the employee was pregnant for nearly six months before it decided to terminate her employment. Payne v. Goodman Mfg. Co., L.P., 726 F. Supp. 2d 891, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67191 (E.D. Tenn. July 6, 2010).

           Defendant city employer's decision not to create a permanent light-duty position for plaintiff employee firefighter took place almost one year after he had filed a prior suit, and the employee did not identify when a refusal to offer him leadership training occurred, thus, his retaliation claims failed.

           While plaintiffs were part of a protected class due to their race and subjected to unwelcome harassment, they failed to show that the union's actions caused the employer to discriminate by having the offending employee reinstated; just because the offending employee's actions were reprehensible did not mean he was not entitled to union membership protection, plus the union's representation of him through the grievance process did not result in his reinstatement, which was the result of a neutral committee's decision.

           The standard for proving age discrimination is that the plaintiff must prove age was a determining factor in the employer's decision to terminate the plaintiff. Bruce v. Western Auto Supply Co., 669 S.W.2d 95, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2871 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
          </p>
          <p>
           Once an age discrimination plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination by articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision.

            Employee failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on allegations that the employee was forced by employer to play music in a hotel lounge that would induce black patrons to leave, since the employee's actions did not subject different classes to disparate treatment where all patrons were subjected to the same music selections.

                 It is the intent of the general assembly to provide protection for individuals who make good faith reports of wrongdoing to appropriate governmental bodies. Information provided by citizens concerning potential misdeeds is vital to effective law enforcement and the efficient operation of government.

                 The general assembly finds that the threat of a civil action for damages in the form of a “strategic lawsuit against political participation” (SLAPP), and the possibility of considerable legal costs, can act as a deterrent to citizens who wish to report information to federal, state, or local agencies. SLAPP suits can effectively punish concerned citizens for exercising the constitutional right to speak and petition the government for redress of grievances.

The “scorecard” shall contain not more than six (6) objective metrics or measures that will be used to reflect the investment strategy approved by the state, which strategy may, in the sole discretion of the commissioner of economic and community development, be modified from time to time upon written request of the TNInvestco to the commissioner of economic and community development.

Within sixty (60) days of receiving the commissioner's findings, the TNInvestco shall provide to the commissioner of economic and community development a written statement that shall describe in detail the TNInvestco's plan for curing all areas of noncompliance before the next annual review. Said plan may include a request for modification of the strategy with corresponding changes in the scorecard which, if approved, shall become the scorecard against which future compliance will be measured.

The general assembly further concludes that there is no systematic ongoing effort, using objective outcome measures, to evaluate human and community service and action organizations. The general assembly further concludes that a statewide strategy for such delivery would enable, promote, and require the effective and efficient coordination of programs, services, and resources among the state's human and community service delivery organizations.

        Compiler's Notes. Acts 2018, ch. 839, § 4 purported to amend § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c29s4-29-239" target="_self">4-29-239</a></cite> by substituting “Tennessee board of energy and natural resources” for “Tennessee board of water quality, oil, and gas” in (a); however, the 2018 amendment by ch. 704, already deleted the former provisions in (a) concerning the Tennessee board of water quality, oil, and gas, created by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.69.html#t69c03s69-3-104" target="_blank">69-3-104</a></cite>, which were transferred to this section by Acts 2018, ch. 704, § 2, effective April 12, 2018. Therefore the amendment was implemented in this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts 2018, ch. 839, § 44 provided that the governor shall take all action necessary to prepare and submit for approval all necessary requests for federal grant funding and applications for authorization to the appropriate federal authority to obtain exclusive jurisdiction over surface coal mining and reclamation operations and the maximum federal money available for those purposes in an expeditious manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts 2018, ch. 839, § 45 provided that the commissioner of environment and conservation shall notify the secretary of state and the executive secretary of the Tennessee code commission of the date this state has been approved to exercise primacy over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations within its territorial boundaries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts 2018, ch. 839, § 47 provided that the act, which amended this section, shall take effect, including for purposes of rulemaking, upon the deposit of federal funds in the Coal Mining Protection Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments. The 2018 amendment by ch. 839 substituted “Tennessee board of energy and natural resources” for “Tennessee board of water quality, oil, and gas” in (a).

      Attorney General Opinions. It is not permissible to conduct dog-racing activities under the Racing Control Act of 1987, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t04c36s4-36-101" target="_self">4-36-101</a></cite> to 402.  As with horse racing, betting on dog racing is illegal.  The Racing Control Act did not authorize betting on dog racing.  When the racing commission ceased to exist, so too did betting on horse racing.  Legislation would be required to reestablish the State Racing Commission.

        It is the intent of the general assembly that the corporation encourage participation by minority-owned businesses.

The corporation is authorized and directed to undertake training programs and other educational activities to enable such minority-owned businesses to compete for contracts on an equal basis. The corporation will strive to maximize participation of minority-owned businesses to achieve a minimum participation goal of fifteen percent (15%) through both prime and second tier business contracting opportunities. The board shall monitor the results of minority-owned business participation and shall report the results of minority-owned business participation to the general assembly at least on an annual basis.

      <p>
       A personal firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in this state and that remains within the borders of this state is not subject to federal law or federal regulation, including registration, under the authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce. It is declared by the legislature that those items have not traveled in interstate commerce. This section applies to a firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured in this state from basic materials and that can be manufactured without the inclusion of any significant parts imported into this state. Generic and insignificant parts that have other manufacturing or consumer product applications are not firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition, and their importation into this state and incorporation into a firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition manufactured in this state does not subject the firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition to federal regulation. It is declared by the legislature that basic materials, such as unmachined steel and unshaped wood, are not firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition and are not subject to congressional authority to regulate firearms, firearms accessories and ammunition under interstate commerce as if they were actually firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition. The authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce in basic materials does not include authority to regulate firearms, firearms accessories and ammunition made in this state from those materials. Firearms accessories that are imported into this state from another state and that are subject to federal regulation as being in interstate commerce do not subject a firearm to federal regulation under interstate commerce because they are attached to or used in conjunction with a firearm in this state.

      Attorney General Opinions. House Bill 660/Senate Bill 635, 110th Gen. Assem. (2017), which would grant the governing body of each state institution of higher education the authority “to determine the qualifications that students must possess to be eligible for payment of in-state tuition and fees,” would not permit individual state institutions of higher education to make unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition. That action would remain prohibited by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, <cite class="us_code">8 U.S.C. § 1621</cite>. Accordingly, the proposed legislation would not implicate or affect other provisions of federal or state law related to unlawful aliens or postsecondary education benefits, including the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, <cite class="us_code">8 U.S.C. § 1623</cite>, and the Hope Scholarship, and Tennessee Promise programs.

      The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

      Attorney General Opinions. The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.
