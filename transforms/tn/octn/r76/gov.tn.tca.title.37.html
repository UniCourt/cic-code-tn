        This part clearly contemplates full evidentiary hearings with the full panoply of constitutional safeguards, making it indispensable that these rights be recognized and protected by a judge having expertise in the field of law. State ex rel. Anglin v. Mitchell, 596 S.W.2d 779, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 415 (Tenn. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute did not entitle plaintiffs to the requested recordings of juvenile court proceedings; although the first subsection permitted inspection of files and records, the third subsection specified that, besides petitions and orders, any other document or record was excluded, and except under limited circumstances, the legislature intended for juvenile court files and records to be kept confidential, and this intent is consistent with the express statutory purpose of providing for the protection of children coming within the juvenile court's jurisdiction. Reguli v. Guffee, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 810 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Feb. 16, 2017).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The legislature never intended to make the juvenile court a general sessions court; the intention was to transfer jurisdiction of the juvenile court to the general sessions court and to make the general sessions court a juvenile court when the subject matter before the court was within the jurisdiction conferred upon juvenile courts. Thus, the laws dealing with appeals from the general sessions court when that court is exercising nonjuvenile court jurisdiction were not controlling in an action to establish paternity; the controlling laws were the appellate procedures provided for juvenile courts. State ex rel. Winberry v. Brooks, 670 S.W.2d 631, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2752 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In matters of legitimation as provided in title 36, ch. 2, the appeal from the court of original jurisdiction is to the court of appeals. Cooper v. Thompson, 710 S.W.2d 944, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to set aside a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity (VAP) based on fraud, and relieve respondent of any future obligation to pay child support and grant his petition against the mother and award him damages consisting of the child support that he had erroneously paid. State ex rel. Whitley v. Lewis, 244 S.W.3d 824, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 458 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 24, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 1065 (Tenn. Nov. 19, 2007), appeal denied, State v. Whitley, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 732 (Tenn. Sept. 29, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the juvenile courts have broad statutory authority to establish a child's paternity and to issue orders setting, modifying, or even terminating child support, the court of appeals found no statute giving the juvenile courts authority, expressly or by implication, to order the state to reimburse a person who has voluntarily paid child support based on the mistaken belief that he was the child's biological father. State ex rel. Whitley v. Lewis, 244 S.W.3d 824, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 458 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 24, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 1065 (Tenn. Nov. 19, 2007), appeal denied, State v. Whitley, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 732 (Tenn. Sept. 29, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court could not order the state of Tennessee to reimburse an alleged father for child support withheld from the alleged father, after it was determined that the alleged father was not a child's father, because: (1) the paternity and support judgment entered against the alleged father in violation of the Servicemembers'  Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C. app. § 501 et seq., was voidable, not void ab initio, so the judgment was valid when child support was withheld; and (2) no statute or other provision granted the juvenile court subject matter to enter the order. State ex rel. Price v. Childers, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 5, 2012).

        Although juvenile proceedings do, in many ways, partake of civil rather than criminal proceedings, the juvenile has a right to counsel, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to have guilt established beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Johnson, 574 S.W.2d 739, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 685 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the purpose and the theory underlying the juvenile court system stated in this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-133" target="_self">37-1-133</a></cite>, courts in recent years have emphasized that in practical effect persons involved in juvenile proceedings may be deprived of their liberty. Increasingly, concepts of the criminal law, and in particular constitutional principles designed to protect the rights of individuals charged with crime, have been deemed to be applicable to proceedings involving juvenile offenders. State v. Johnson, 574 S.W.2d 739, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 685 (Tenn. 1978).

       <p>
        Under the Tennessee Juvenile Courts Act, read in context of federal constitutional principles relating to due process and the assistance of counsel, a juvenile court is required to grant a juvenile the right to counsel in proceedings involving the question whether such court should waive its exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile as a minor and authorize the juvenile to be subjected to felony prosecutions. Mullins v. Lane, 484 F. Supp. 237, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11632 (E.D. Tenn. 1979).

        Definition of abandoned child of former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b1" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(1)</a></cite> (repealed) was applicable to cases concerning custody jurisdiction of juvenile court and is not necessarily the same as the definition of abandonment used for purposes of adoption. Pack v. Rogers, 538 S.W.2d 607, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 220 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).

        Only where termination of parental rights is predicated upon the abandonment of the child by the parents has the general assembly required the trier of fact to find that the acts of the parents were willful. State, Dep't of Human Services v. Smith, 785 S.W.2d 336, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (Tenn. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Totality of the evidence, including the pre-incarceration conduct of father coupled with the obvious inability of the father to establish and provide a stable home for the child and the total lack of any chance of an early integration of the child into a stable and permanent home unless parental rights of the father were terminated was so compellingly in the best interests of the child that his parental rights had to be terminated. Department of Human Servs. v. Hauck, 872 S.W.2d 916, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 700 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993), appeal denied, 1994 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Feb. 28, 1994).

        Clear and convincing evidence child was dependent or neglected was established where 14-year-old girl was in fear of living at home because older brother was sexually molesting her and father, who had previously sexually assaulted her and been placed in jail, had just been released. In re Dunigan, 658 S.W.2d 112, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A finding of substantial harm to the child was supported by evidence that the mother, along with her husband, was responsible for injuries to the child, that she was aware abuse was occurring prior to the time she took the child to the hospital, that she failed to protect the child from abuse, and that the conduct was likely to cause great harm or death. Nash-Putnam v. McCloud, 921 S.W.2d 170, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 252 (Tenn. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was clear and convincing evidence that mother committed severe child abuse under Tenn. Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> because by deliberately and recklessly ignoring father's pedophilic interests, mother knowingly failed to protect her daughter from being raped by father and failed to protect her sons who were exposed to father's acts and the sexual environment that existed in her home; accordingly, circuit court properly found that the children were dependent and neglected because they suffered from severe abuse, mother injured or endangered her children's health, and mother was unfit to care for the children. In re H.L.F., 297 S.W.3d 223, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was clear and convincing evidence that father engaged in severe child abuse because: (1) Several child witnesses stated that they observed him raping and/or sexually assaulting his daughter and one of her friends, both under the age of 13; (2) Children's testimony was corroborated by medical experts and the testimony of other professionals; (3) Children's statements were validated by numerous exhibits, photographs, magazines, videos, and “sex toys,” which the children accurately identified; (4) Father's 10-year-old son witnessed him having sex with the daughter; and (5) Father exposed the boys to his sexual abuse of at least two minor girls, to “sex toys,” to the parents'  sexual activity, and to numerous and varied pornographic materials; thus, circuit court properly found that the children were dependent and neglected because the children were severely abused, father injured or endangered the morals or health of his children or others, and father was unfit to care for them. In re H.L.F., 297 S.W.3d 223, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the custody disposition was not temporary, invalid, or fraudulent, the trial court correctly held that the superior rights doctrine could not be asserted by the father in his counter-petition for custody of his son. At the time of the order, the child was dependent and neglected, within the meaning of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, and the guardians, having raised him since his birth, were fit and proper custodians of the child. In re Landon H., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 24 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the lack of physical abuse towards two children, when a mother perpetrated severe abuse against the children's sibling or willingly placed the children in a home where she should have recognized that abuse was occurring, the mother provided “improper guardianship or control so as to injure or endanger the morals or health” of the two children, so as to render them dependent and neglected, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>. State v. Byrd, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 105 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2012), appeal denied, In re Morgan R., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 227 (Tenn. Apr. 12, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's severe abuse of an eight-month-old child provided clear and convincing evidence to support a finding that the child and his two siblings were dependent and neglected, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, because by perpetrating severe abuse against the eight-month-old child or willingly placing her children in a home where she should have recognized that abuse was occurring on that night, the mother provided improper guardianship or control so as to injure or endanger the morals or health of the three children. In re Dakota C.R., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 265 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the abuse and neglect suffered by an infant, it was clear that other children under the mother's care were under such improper guardianship as to endanger the health of such child and it would be anomalous indeed if the Department, after finding one child in a household had suffered abuse and neglect, was powerless under the dependency and neglect statutes to remove other children in the household. In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2012), appeal denied, In re Shanira J., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 757 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported a trial court's finding that a child was dependent and neglected, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129ol1a2" target="_self">37-1-129(a)(2)</a></cite>, because the child provided consistent disclosures to two therapists of abundant accounts of severe child abuse, including rape, incest, and aggravated sexual battery, perpetrated by his mother and other adults around the mother; the mother, among other transgressions, raped the child when he was around age ten or eleven. In re Wyatt S., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 790 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 13, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied a mother's motion to modify a temporary order giving custody of her special needs child to the grandparents, resulting from a finding of dependency and neglect, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, because the grandparents established by clear and convincing evidence the child would face a risk of substantial harm if custody were awarded to the mother, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129" target="_self">37-1-129</a></cite>; the grandparents were addressing the child's medical and educational needs while the mother was unaware of those needs. In re Hannah v. S., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 849 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 7, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        No statutory ground for dependency and neglect, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, existed with respect to a mother's child. Though the family who had cared for the child for a period during the case argued that the mother was morally unfit to properly care for the child and presented past postings from the mother's social networking pages to bolster their argument, the record contained no evidence that the child had seen or knew about the mother's postings, that she would be exposed to them in the future, or any effect the exposure would have on her morals. In re Alysia M. S., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory ground for dependency and neglect in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> did not apply with respect to a mother's child as there was no clear and convincing evidence that the child suffered direct or indirect abuse or neglect by the mother. In re Alysia M. S., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        No statutory ground for dependency and neglect, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, existed with respect to a mother's child. Though the evidence showed that the mother had tested positive for marijuana in the past, she had since passed random drug screens, attended weekly celebratory recovery meetings, had been working with a sponsor, and was trying to become a sponsor herself. No party introduced into evidence the drug screening results. In re Alysia M. S., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody dispute between a father from California and the maternal grandparents from Tennessee, the orders of a Tennessee circuit court determining jurisdiction, custody, and any visitation to the father were vacated because it failed to conduct a de novo review of the dependency and neglect proceedings under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-130" target="_self">37-1-130</a></cite>. In re Lillian F. W., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 659 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2013), appeal denied, In re Lillian W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (Tenn. Feb. 13, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in holding that a child was dependent and neglected because the evidence that the mother at some point in the past engaged in once-per-week marijuana use and had a single positive drug test was insufficient to show that she was unfit to properly care for the child or that he was dependent and neglected, and the circuit court did not refer to the definition of a “dependent and neglected the child” or ascertain and state the subsection or subsections applicable to the facts. In re K. A. P., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 802 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 17, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        To find the child dependent and neglected, the children's services department did not need to show direct evidence of abuse; it was clear the child suffered abuse while in the care of the mother and father, it was not incumbent on the court to determine which one abused the child, and the claim by the mother and father that they were unaware of how they inflicted the injury on the child was irrelevant. In re Colby W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 30, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the trial court's adjudication of the child as a dependent and neglected child, given that none of the possible causes proposed by the mother had any evidentiary support, the child suffered two separate brain bleeding injuries that were unexplained, a doctor testified that the second injury was the result of abusive trauma, and it was clear that the child was abused while in the care of the mother and father. In re Colby W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 30, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in finding a child dependent and neglected and in awarding custody of the child jointly to the child's parent and grandparent, based on the parent's stipulation of dependency and neglect, because the record lacked clear and convincing evidence that the child was dependent and neglected as of the date of the de novo hearing by the court. In re Landon H., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 147 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 25, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alleged lack of an order adjudicating a child to be dependent and neglected “as regards” the child's father did not prohibit sustaining a termination of the father's parental rights because (1) nothing in T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b12" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(12)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-130" target="_self">37-1-130</a></cite> required an adjudication “as regards” a specific parent, and (2) the trial court's orders sufficiently found the child was dependent and neglected for reasons related to the father. In re Daymien T., 506 S.W.3d 461, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 540 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 27, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 752 (Tenn. Oct. 21, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In this dependency case, the trial court did not simply rely on the father's drug use to establish that he sexually abused the child; instead, the trial court rendered a credibility determination based on the father's in-court demeanor and the effects of drug use on him, which was not improper. In re M.D., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 746 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Four-year-old child made disclosures of sexual abuse by the father, and any inconsistency in the disclosures did not go to whether sexual abuse occurred; the child was dependent and neglected and a victim of sexual abuse by the father. In re M.D., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 746 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that all of the children were dependent and neglected, as all of the children were the victims of excessive discipline, which included in part being beaten with an extension cord, being forced to sleep on the floor despite the fact that a bed was available, and having their hands, feet, mouths, and eyes duct-taped. In re Tamera W., 515 S.W.3d 860, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 859 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (Tenn. Feb. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in adjudicating the child dependent and neglected because, even disregarding the medical records of a crisis stabilization unit, the evidence clearly and convincingly established that, at the time of the hearing, the mother's mental incapacity rendered her unfit and unable to properly care for her child as a senior psychological examiner diagnosed the mother with an adjustment disorder with anxiety and recommended treatment; the examiner agreed that, without treatment, the mother was at risk for continued overreaction to events she found stressful; and, while the examiner expected the mother's condition to improve, that expectation was predicated on her participation in counseling and therapy. In re Yvonne R., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 446 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 3, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's abuse of child 1 demonstrated that child 2 was under such improper guardianship so as to injure or endanger his morals or health and was dependent and neglected under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b13F" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(13)(F)</a></cite>. The evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding that child 2 was dependent and neglected in the mother's care. In re B.B., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 517 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 763 (Tenn. Nov. 16, 2017).
       </p>

        Parents'  argument that the use of the present tense in the dependency and neglect statute belied the use of future or past circumstances as the basis for a current finding of dependency and neglect was rejected as the past and anticipated circumstances could be a relevant indication of a parent's fitness.

        Evidence was sufficient to support the circuit court's findings of dependency and neglect where the testimony of the parents, the children's counselors, and state workers established that the children were engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior, the parents were unable or unwilling to properly supervise the children, and the failure of the parents to accept responsibility for their own conduct, which allowed the inappropriate sexual behavior to develop and continue, demonstrated that significant improvements would not be made to their supervision.

        Trial court properly adjudicated a father's children as dependent and neglected and severely abused in the care of the father because the mother testified at the dependency and neglect and severe child abuse hearing that she and the father abused drugs and alcohol together numerous times while she was pregnant and that the father provided her illegal drugs and alcoholic beverages during that time.

        Because father's petition alleged that mother permitted the child to skip school without justification and encouraged the child to lie about doing so, the petition alleged that the child was “unlawfully kept out of school” by mother, for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b13C" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(13)(C)</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the father's petition contained assertions that were tantamount to allegations of dependency and neglect, the juvenile court had exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and all actions taken by the trial court were void.

       </p>
       <p>
        Not all statements in father's petition were tantamount to allegations of dependency and neglect; allegation that the child was uncomfortable having friends over due to living conditions was not an allegation that the child was endangered, allegations that the mother had male guests who drank too much was not an allegation that the mother was unfit, and the mother's alleged use of profanity did not seem to rise to the level of immorality that made a parent unfit.

        Father's petition alleged that the child was often left home alone, even in the middle of the night; if these allegations did not fit squarely within T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b13C" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(13)(C)</a></cite>, they were very close.

       <p>
        Father's petition alleged that mother's drug use occurred in the presence of the child, and that the child had access to both marijuana and mother's pipe; these allegations fit within T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b13F" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(13)(F)</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Assertions that there was little or no food in the home and that the child returned to the father without clean clothes or even proper undergarments raised serious questions about the child's health and hygiene; thus, these allegations fit within T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b13F" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(13)(F)</a></cite>.

        Trial court did not err by finding that the children were dependent and neglected because the evidence did not preponderate against its findings that one child suffered a series of non-accidental injuries, the child's non-parental caregivers were not responsible for the injuries, and the trial court did not credit the parents'  denials.

        Trial court properly denied a father's motion to dismiss the mother's petition for modification of their parenting plan—to include a provision, inter alia, precluding the father from any direct or indirect contact with the children—because the mother invoked the court's subject matter jurisdiction when she filed her petition, the petition raised allegations that the children were abused and neglected—the father administered excessive beatings on the children with various objects—and the court then considered the statutory factors to make the best interest determination.

        Trial court did not err in finding that a mothers'  children were dependent and neglected, when one child was a victim of aggravated child abuse by the father, because the court considered the mother's Alford plea to child endangerment in reaching its decision that the mother committed child endangerment as to the child and in concluding that the mother's act of child endangerment resulted in serious bodily injury to the child as a doctor testified that the child suffered brain injuries a result of abusive head trauma.

        Determination that the children were dependent and neglected as to the mother was supported by the trial court's consideration of the mother's cooperation with her case manager in taking her medication, her anger issues, her failure to understand the severity of her mental health issues as shown by her belief that she did not need her prescribed medication and was only taking them to show the court she was fit to care for her children.

        Child was dependent and neglected as the father was unfit to care for the child and the child was suffering from abuse or neglect because a senior psychological examiner diagnosed the father with anxiety disorder; the examiner opined that when the father was faced with intense emotional stress or pressure, he became reactive; the examiner strongly recommended that the father be referred for medical stabilization of his disturbed sleep and anxiety symptoms, individual supportive counseling, parenting skills training, and family counseling; and the father admitted that he had not done anything to improve his mental state or his relationship with his son and that it was not worth swallowing his pride to go to counseling to get his son back.

        In a child neglect case alleging failure to seek medical treatment for the child, trial court improperly granted defendant's motion to dismiss the child neglect charge before trial was held because: (1) Only relevant undisputed facts were that defendant was not the biological parent of the child, not her legal guardian, and not married to the co-defendant, her mother, which was not enough information to warrant a dismissal of the indictment; (2) State could present other circumstances that might establish duty on the part of defendant arising out of in loco parentis relationship; and (3) State might be able to establish that defendant failed to perform a statutory duty to provide adequate medical care for the child.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient clear and convincing evidence to support the trial court's termination of a mother's parental rights over her child due to having subjected him to severe child abuse by exposing him in utero to her drug use pursuant to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-113ol1g4" target="_blank">36-1-113(g)(4)</a></cite>; she abused prescription pain medication during her pregnancy, which caused serious bodily injury to the child and caused him to be hospitalized for treatment.

       <p>
        Clear and convicing evidence was sufficient under T.R.A.P. 13(d) to support a trial court's determination that termination of a mother's parental rights over her child was in the child's best interest under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-113ol1i1" target="_blank">36-1-113(i)(1)</a></cite>-(9), as her incestuous relationship with the child's sibling constituted severe abuse that warranted termination pursuant to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-113ol1g4" target="_blank">36-1-113(g)(4)</a></cite>, and the child had started over in a new community with his father and the father's wife.

       <p>
        Where a mother was an experienced parent with two older children, yet her infant was brought in on multiple occassions malnourished, and the mother failed to take the child to a physician, the evidence in the record preponderated in favor of a finding that the mother engaged in knowing neglect that is likely to cause serious bodily injury. In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2012), appeal denied, In re Shanira J., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 757 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a child had multiple rib fractures occurring on different dates, the evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that the mother either knowingly inflicted the serious bodily injury on the child or knowingly failed to protect him from the serious bodily injury. In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2012), appeal denied, In re Shanira J., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 757 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2012).

       <p>
        When a mother's explanation that a child's leg was broken while being extracted from a crib was juxtaposed against a doctor's testimony that the break likely occurred due to a blow, and the doctor's testimony was considered as a whole, the evidence preponderated in favor of a factual finding that the child's femur fracture did not occur in the manner the mother suggested but was the result of nonaccidental trauma. When that fact was considered along with the other evidence of multiple rib fractures, skull fractures and a failure to provide sufficient nutrition, the evidence was clear and convincing that the mother committed severe child abuse. In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2012), appeal denied, In re Shanira J., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 757 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported a trial court's finding that a mother committed severe child abuse under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> when she knowingly exposed the five-week-old child to and knowingly failed to protect the child from abuse that was likely to cause great bodily harm. The mother's position that there were no signs to indicate that severe child abuse by the father was highly probable was unpersuasive as the mother knew the father could be “violent,” had seen the father handling the child roughly, heard the child scream while alone with the father, and expressed concern about leaving the child with the father.

       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported terminating a mother's parental rights to five children on grounds of severe child abuse because the mother admitted using cocaine during four of her five pregnancies, acknowledged she was warned prenatal drug use was dangerous, and knew such conduct was wrong; the mother's prenatal abuse of cocaine constituted severe child abuse even though the children had not suffered long-lasting effects. In re Shannon P., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 457 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 16, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 789 (Tenn. Oct. 16, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court properly terminated a mother's parental rights on the basis of severe child abuse because one child suffered inflicted trauma when the children were alone with the mother, and the injury could not have been inflicted by a sixteen-month-old child, by the child himself, or in the course of providing routine child care. In re Travion B., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 539 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 19, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 883 (Tenn. Nov. 4, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported a finding that a mother and her boyfriend, who was the father of one of the three children at issue, committed severe child abuse because a healthy two-year-old child suffered catastrophic injuries while in the care of the mother and the boyfriend, the delay in seeking treatment for the child resulted in permanent brain injury, and even if the mother did not abuse the child or witness abuse, the mother knowingly exposed her children to abuse. In re Adriana L., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 642 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 1084 (Tenn. Dec. 23, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported a determination that a one-year-old child was dependent and neglected upon a finding that the father knowingly engaged in severe child abuse because the father became aggressive when approached by the police and began to grab the child around his head and neck in a manner the officers deemed was likely to cause severe harm or death to the child; the officer dealing directly with the father believed he was going to break the child's neck. In re Kason K. C., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 271 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 7, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported terminating a father's parental rights to two children on grounds of severe child abuse because the father admitted that he supplied drugs to the mother for her use during pregnancy, the mother's drug use resulted in serious bodily injury and death of the children's sibling, and the father's severe child abuse against the sibling served as the basis for severe child abuse against the two children. In re Garvin M., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 274 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 9, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that a child had suffered severe child abuse by her father for purposes of being adjudicated dependent and neglected; the evidence clearly and convincingly showed that the father had touched the child and penetrated her vagina with his finger. In re Kaitlynne D., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 297 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 21, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, because the juvenile court found at a hearing that the mother committed severe abuse by exposing the youngest child to methamphetamine in utero and relieved the Department of Children's Services (DCS) of its obligation of further reasonable efforts toward reunification, and because the mother was afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard at the hearing and the adjudication of the dependency and neglect action, the mother's due process rights were not violated when the DCS discontinued funding for drug counseling services. In re C.L., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 28, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court found that severe child abuse had been committed against the child by the mother, and the evidence did not preponderate against this finding; the mother was aware of her boyfriend's abusive actions toward her other children in the past, she knew he abused alcohol and drugs and became angry when he did so, and yet she still left her children in his care, and she failed to protect her child, who suffered a skull fracture, from the boyfriend's severe abuse. In re K.P., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 313 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 28, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lasting or permanent injury is not required to sustain a finding of severe child abuse, and thus the court was not persuaded by the mother's effort to challenge the abuse finding by claiming the skull fracture that the child suffered was expected to heal without issue; the child's skull fracture without more fell within the definition of severe child abuse. In re K.P., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 313 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 28, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights to children was appropriate because clear and convincing evidence showed that the parents committed severe child abuse against each of their children. There was sexual abuse by one parent while the other parent watched and sexual acts between the children observed by the parents, as well as physical abuse and exposure to domestic violence that caused psychological harm. In re Samuel P., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 367 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 816 (Tenn. Sept. 22, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights was proper on the basis of severe abuse because, in addition to using illegal drugs, which the father provided to the mother during pregnancy, the mother was present in a house with the father where the act of creating methamphetamine was occurring. In re Alexis C., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 363 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 25, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was undisputed that the child suffered severe child abuse, and the mother's claim that she did not knowingly fail to protect him was rejected; weeks prior to the child's nonaccidental brain bleeding injury, he suffered another such injury, which would have caused noticeable symptoms, but the mother never reported the injury, and her failure to protect the child despite having been presented with facts from which she should have recognized that severe abuse either had occurred or likely would occur was sufficient to support the finding that she committed severe child abuse. In re Colby W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 30, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's parental rights based on severe child abuse was appropriate because the children were subject to continuous physical punishment and intentional deprivation of food by the mother. In re Shameel S., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 578 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 19, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found that the mother had committed severe abuse for purposes of terminating her parental rights where she had not timely appealed a final order regarding the disposition of the child as dependent and neglected due to severe child abuse. In re Serenity S., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 765 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported terminating a father's parental rights on grounds of severe child abuse because the eight-month-old child suffered a subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhages, and fractures to his right leg while solely in the father's care, and the injuries were “non-accidental”; the child suffered hearing loss and developmental delays as a result of the injuries. In re Jaden W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 856 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 26, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 280 (Tenn. Mar. 25, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence did not support terminating a mother's parental rights on grounds of severe child abuse because the mother could not be charged with the knowledge that the father would harm their child based on his violence towards her and his ex-wife, there was no evidence indicating the father had ever exhibited violence towards a child, and there was no evidence to suggest there were signs of any injuries to the child before his admission to the hospital. In re Jaden W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 856 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 26, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 280 (Tenn. Mar. 25, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dependency and neglect proceeding in which the child was found to be a victim of severe child abuse by aggravated sexual battery, the trial court did not err in admitting the out of court statements of the child because those statements were sufficiently bolstered by indicia of reliability so as to render them admissible as the disclosures of the child to the forensic interviewer, a licensed clinical social worker, her pediatrician, the grandmother, and the mother corroborated and sustained the reliability of the statements; and the father had ample opportunity to question and examine the conveyors of the disclosures. In re Emmalee O., 464 S.W.3d 311, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 34 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 478 (Tenn. June 12, 2015), cert. denied, Overton v. Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that the three-year-old child was a victim of severe child abuse by aggravated sexual battery, in finding both of the father's children to be dependent and neglected, in enjoining him from having any contact with his two daughters, and in placing sole custody of the children with the mother because the evidence presented to the trial court against the father rose to the level of clear and convincing as the child made multiple disclosures to multiple people that the father poked, rubbed, and otherwise touched her privates; the child's privates were irritated upon return from visitation with the father; and the child had consistently identified only the father as the perpetrator of those actions. In re Emmalee O., 464 S.W.3d 311, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 34 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 478 (Tenn. June 12, 2015), cert. denied, Overton v. Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper because the trial court previously found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the child was severely abused by the mother in that she knowingly allowed the child to be present within a structure where the act of creating methamphetamine was occurring; and the mother did not appeal the November 2013 adjudicatory order. In re J.R.C., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 255 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights based on his sentence of more than two years for conduct against the child deemed severe child abuse. In re T.L.G., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 369 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 26, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court noted the father's convictions in Ohio for multiple rapes and an attempted rape of the child and found that the father's acts that led to his incarceration constituted severe child abuse, and the trial court properly considered the father's rape convictions for purposes of a parental termination proceeding; the trial court properly found that the father committed acts that fell within the definition of rape, and in addition, enumerated offenses relevant herein included aggravated sexual battery and rape of a child, and the trial court did not err in terminating the father's rights. In re T.L.G., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 369 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 26, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings to terminate a mother's parental rights, clear and convincing evidence existed to establish the ground of severe abuse because the mother and the father were again manufacturing methamphetamine in their home, the mother tested positive for methamphetamine at that time and admitted to methamphetamine use, and, shortly thereafter, the young child also tested positive for methamphetamine. In re Wesley P., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 29, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court properly terminated the parents'  parental rights pursuant based on severe abuse because their children made multiple disclosures of sexual abuse perpetrated on them by the parents to several individuals, the children were acting out sexually and with each other and had knowledge of sexual matters far beyond what was appropriate for children of their age, reunification was not realistic or in the best interests of the children, the absence of criminal charges relating to sexual abuse did not undermine the evidence, the suggestion of “coaching” was unsupported by the record, and the parents had made absolutely no genuine reckoning with the sexual abuse allegations. In re C.A.F., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 612 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 29, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's parental rights to an adopted child based on severe child abuse was proper because, although the mother argued that her boyfriend had committed the abuse, the evidence in the record established that the mother also abused the child by both paddling her and binding her with cable ties; the parent facing termination of her parental rights did not have to have caused the abuse as the definition of severe child abuse included the knowing failure to protect a child from abuse or neglect that was likely to cause serious bodily injury; and the mother admitted in her interview that she knew that her boyfriend abused her children, including the adopted child, on an almost daily basis. In re Americus C., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 803 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the order outlining the conditions that led to the removal of the child is pending appeal, that order is not res judicata, and until that order has reached its final completion, the prior order cannot form the basis alone for termination on any ground that contemplates reliance on a previous finding or order; because the current posture of the father's appeal from the order on dependency and neglect, where the juvenile court found the child was a victim of sexual abuse, could be determined, the trial court erred in terminating his rights on the ground of persistence of conditions. In re S.S.-G., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 917 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court stated only that the father had sexually abused the child, which constituted severe abuse, but the trial court's failure to include the specific statutory definitions that it relied upon prevented meaningful review; where the statute provides several possible definitions for a ground, the trial court must specify the exact definition that it relies upon in reaching its ultimate conclusion, and the termination of the father's rights on the ground of severe child abuse was vacated. In re S.S.-G., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 917 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's conclusion that the parents committed severe child abuse against their adopted daughter was supported by clear and convincing evidence where it showed that they were neglectful in procuring medical care and dental care, provided inadequate nutrition, and subjected the child to physical abuse. In re C.M., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 976 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2015), appeal denied, In re Carolina M., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 344 (Tenn. May 5, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's rights for severe abuse was proper, given in part that she moved often and left the children in the care of boyfriends who were abusive, the children were exposed to a pattern of neglect while in the mother's custody, and they had psychological issues because of that. In re Joseph F., 492 S.W.3d 690, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 227 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 377 (Tenn. May 10, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that children were the victims of severe child abuse because it heard clear and convincing evidence that the father knowingly exposed his children or knowingly failed to protect his children from an environment that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death; by the father's own admission, the children were present in an outbuilding where items used to manufacture methamphetamine were discovered. In re Mason E., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 334 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 16, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Children were severely abused by a parent as evidenced by the parent's driving while under the influence of prescription medication, for which medication the parent did not have a prescription, while the children were in the car. In re Addison E., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 447 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 30, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the findings of termination of the parental rights of the mother and father based on severe child abuse, given the second-degree burn that the child sustained while in his mother's care and the father's failure to procure medical attention for the child; there was medical testimony that the injury was consistent with non-accidental trauma that caused the child substantial pain. In re Derrick J., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 8, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on severe child abuse because, despite being aware of the risks, the mother persistently abused drugs while pregnant; she knowingly exposed the child to abuse that was likely to cause serious bodily injury or death; and that exposure caused the child to experience drug withdrawals after birth and necessitated the child's hospitalization for an extended period of time. In re Joshua C., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 28, 2016).
       </p>

        Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based on severe child abuse because, prior to the termination hearing, the trial court entered an order adjudicating the child dependent and neglected based upon a finding that the mother had committed severe child abuse by failing to protect the child from acts that met the statutory definitions of rape, aggravated sexual assault, rape of a child, and incest. In re C.D.,  S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 646 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2016).

        One of the parents'  minor child was the victim of severe abuse by both parents because the child's multiple skull fractures constituted a serious bodily injury. Furthermore, the children's counselor testified that the child suffered from Post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the physical abuse which the child suffered in the home.

        Because the juvenile court's order of dependency and neglect was final and was not appealed, grounds for termination existed based on severe abuse; the juvenile court adjudicated the children to be dependent and neglected after finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that all three children were victims of severe child abuse.

       <p>
        Credible evidence supported a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that a parent committed severe child abuse because the parent was responsible for the child's injuries by the parent's knowing use of force as the child suffered a liver laceration, an injury, which a doctor opined occurred as a result of significant trauma, that constituted a serious bodily injury to the child. In re Damian M., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 738 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (Tenn. Jan. 19, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's rights on the grounds of severe child abuse was proper, given that a previously issued final order found that the mother had severely abused one child, and that finding was res judicata, plus it supported a finding that a half-sibling of the other children was the victim of severe child abuse. In re Alfonzo E., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 797 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2017).

        Father was aware of the nature of the abuse and believed the discipline administered was excessive but did not make a considered effort to prevent the abuse from occurring; the trial court did not err in finding that the father knowingly failed to protect the children from abuse in spite of his borderline intellectual functioning, given that a doctor did not indicate that the father's failure to protect the children was the result of his inability to understand the wrongfulness of the abuse.

        Evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's finding of severe abuse; the bruising, lacerations, and other marks on the children caused by whipping, regardless of whether the instrument used was a belt or an extension cord, constituted serious bodily injury, and the mother caused these injuries to the children. In re Tamera W., 515 S.W.3d 860, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 859 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (Tenn. Feb. 8, 2017).

        Mother's conduct in failing to feed her youngest child appropriately and failing to seek medical care for him constituted severe child abuse because an expert testified that the mother's actions of neglect toward the child resulting in severe nutritional malnourishment could produce severe developmental delay or intellectual disability in the child, and was likely to cause serious bodily injury or death; she admitted to hospital personnel that she noticed that the child was not growing approximately three months before he was admitted to the hospital; the mother was aware that it was not appropriate for the child to gain only eight ounces in six months; and, despite that knowledge, she did not seek medical treatment for the child.

        Trial court did not err in terminating the parental rights of a mother because there was clear and convincing evidence that the mother committed severe child abuse; the mother took photographs of the child's genitals and sent them to a known sex offender, who had discussed with her his sexual interest in the child, and her actions constituted especially aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor and severe child abuse.

        Although the mother contended that a lower standard was used to imply severe child abuse against her as she was only convicted of criminally negligent homicide, because the trial court made an additional finding that the mother committed severe abuse as she knew or should have known that the father abused the children in a way that could cause serious bodily injury or death, the mother's parental rights were properly terminated as she committed severe abuse by failing to protect the deceased child from the father's known abuse.

        Termination of the father's parental rights based on severe child abuse was proper because the severe abuse he committed against the deceased child resulted in her death; he was tried and convicted of aggravated child abuse and felony murder and was serving a life sentence for his actions; his convictions established severe child abuse that served as the basis for termination of his parental rights; and severe child abuse committed against one sibling resulted in severe child abuse against the other siblings.

        Circuit court properly found two of the parents'  three children to be the victims of severe child abuse because they tested positive for methamphetamine during the time they were in the mother's care, whether mother exposed the children to drugs or she allowed her mother or someone else to expose the children, she failed to protect the children from exposure to drug, it was their exposure to harm that mattered, not the method or level of exposure, the express statutory language did not limit serious bodily injury to the listed conditions and did not require a finding of specific harm, and the children were the victims of severe child abuse due to drug exposure, regardless of the fact that their sibling tested negative for drugs.

        Clear and convincing evidence showed a mother's severe abuse because the evidence showed the mother knew it was highly probable the mother's boyfriend would severely abuse the mother's child, as the mother knew the abuse had occurred and tried to conceal the abuse.

       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, the hearsay testimony regarding the children's statements related to issues concerning severe child abuse were admissible because there was no competent evidence that their statements were not trustworthy; the children described the mother's drug use consistently at different times to the Child Protective Services Investigator and the foster mother, and the specifics of the matters about which the children reported placed them in danger of serious bodily harm by their exposure to illicit drugs and drug paraphernalia; and the father was aware of the threat to their safety inasmuch as they reported the mother's drug use to him.

       <p>
        Termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights was proper because they committed severe child abuse as the findings of the autism center and a doctor were compelling evidence of severe child abuse while in the parents'  custody as the child was essentially nonverbal, having to grunt or point to communicate, and his language delays severely impaired his ability to function in his environment and adversely affected his ability to learn, but there was evidence that the child improved immensely after his removal from the parents'  custody; and the center ruled out autism as the cause for the child's developmental delays.

       <p>
        Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights on the ground of severe child abuse because a judgment in another proceeding found her guilty of severe child abuse of the child's half-sister; viewed in context, the mother's testimony in the other proceeding simply did not establish a basis upon which to hold that the child abuse adjudication was tainted by fraud or collusion, by constitutional infirmity, or in any other way not entitled to res judicata effect.

        Because the order adjudicating the mother to have severely abused the child's sibling was a final judgment, the trial court found that she committed severe child abuse, and termination of her parental rights on this ground was proper.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred by declining to find severe child abuse, even though it could not determine which parent caused the abuse, because the evidence clearly and convincingly established that the father or the mother subjected the child to severe child abuse and that the other parent covered for the other rather than protecting the child from the abuse.

        Termination of the father's parental rights to his two children was proper on the ground of severe child abuse, severe child sexual abuse, and receiving a sentence more than two years for conduct against a child and a sentence of 10 or more years when the children were eight years old because he was convicted of rape of a child, and was sentenced to serve 35 years in prison at 100%.

        Sufficient evidence supported the termination of the mother's parental rights based on severe child abuse because the trial court found that the child was the victim of severe child abuse in a dependency and neglect order based on his positive hair follicle test for methamphetamine, and the mother did not appeal the order.

       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the father's rights was proper based on his child abuse sentence; he pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated child neglect and received a suspended sentence of 10 years imprisonment, the incident underlying his conviction, where one child obtained a loaded and unsecured handgun and shot himself in the arm, was found by the juvenile court to constitute severe child abuse, and the fact that the father did not serve any jail time did not preclude termination of his rights on this ground. In re Shyanne H., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 292 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 25, 2020), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 516 (Tenn. Sept. 18, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the issue of whether the parents committed severe child abuse in the past was fully litigated, that issue was res judicata, plus the juvenile court also properly terminated the parents'  rights based upon new findings that they had committed severe child abuse; the children disclosed that the father hit, choked, and whipped them, and the mother held one child by the neck and hit her in the face with a frying pan. The abuse the children endured caused them severe psychological issues, as determined by a clinical psychologist. In re Shyanne H., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 292 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 25, 2020), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 516 (Tenn. Sept. 18, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        What rendered the trial court's application of collateral estoppel erroneous was the improper use of an inapplicable statute, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c15s39-15-401ol1c" target="_blank">39-15-401(c)</a></cite>, under which subsection the mother was not convicted, to prevent her from defending against the severe child abuse statute; this holding did not disrupt the principle that criminal convictions could serve to establish severe child abuse, thereby collaterally estopping a litigant from relitigating the same issue previously litigated in a prior criminal conviction. In re Zaliyah S., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 296 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 26, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported finding that twins were dependent and neglected due to severe child abuse by the mother; trial court's application of the definition of knowingly in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c15s39-15-401ol1c" target="_blank">39-15-401(c)</a></cite> for collateral estoppel purposes, while error as the mother had been convicted under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.39.html#t39c15s39-15-401ol1b" target="_blank">39-15-401(b)</a></cite>, the error was harmless. Given a nurse's testimony and photographs, the twins were the victims of severe child abuse in that they were malnourished and the mother admitted her failure to properly feed them and she knew of the danger to their lives.

        Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's determination of severe child abuse as the evidence was clear that the mother had knowingly failed to protect the three eldest children from physical abuse in California and in Tennessee, had participated in some of the abusive acts, and participated in ongoing arguments and altercations with the father.

        While the father may have taken steps to stop the father's use of drugs and to remove the father's father from the father's life, clear and convincing evidence supported the finding that the father had committed severe child abuse because the child was present during incidents of domestic violence at the home of the father's parents and the father had taken the child with the father to places where the father used or acquired drugs.

        Trial court did not err in terminating the parental rights of a mother and father because pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-113ol1g4" target="_blank">36-1-113(g)(4)</a></cite>, the Tennessee Department of Children's Services proved the ground of severe abuse by proving that the mother and father had been found to have committed severe abuse of the children's half-sibling; the mother was found to have committed severe abuse because she knew about the father's abuse of the half-sibling and did nothing to protect her.

        Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of the father's parental rights where a court found that he had committed severe child abuse against his son under this section and he did not appeal.

        Grounds for termination of parental rights existed because a parent (1) whipped one child to the point that the child was bruised and the child's face was lacerated; and (2) continued to abuse illicit substances while pregnant with another child, despite the parent's knowledge of the potential dangers (including the risk of serious bodily injury or even death of the in utero child) of continued illicit substance abuse during the parent's pregnancy with the child.

        Trial court did not err in finding that grounds existed to terminate the father's parental rights to the children for severe abuse; the father struck the mother with a baseball bat stating that he knew he would be arrested, the children were present at the time, and the father had attacked two of the children and was incarcerated.

        Juvenile court properly terminated a father's parental rights on the ground of severe child abuse because the father, along with the mother, perpetrated severe child abuse through the supply and use of illegal drugs and non-prescribed pain medication.

        Nothing in the definition of a dependent and neglected child requires that a ground for termination of parental rights has been established by appropriate proof, and the same is true of the definition of severe abuse; there are no cases in which Tennessee courts have held that a ground for termination or a best interest determination must be made in order to adjudicate a child dependent and neglected or the victim of severe abuse, and dependency and neglect proceeding and termination of parental rights proceeding are separate proceedings. In re Tamera W., 515 S.W.3d 860, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 859 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (Tenn. Feb. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in either the definition of a dependent and neglected child or severe abuse requires that the trial court determine whether the parent has complied with an applicable permanency plan; whether the parent has made lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social services agencies alone does not prevent the trial court from finding the children dependent and neglected or to be the victims of severe abuse. In re Tamera W., 515 S.W.3d 860, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 859 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (Tenn. Feb. 8, 2017).

        Although the trial court properly found that the mother had committed severe child abuse against her youngest child, the foster parent's petition to terminate her parental rights was improperly denied as termination was in the child's best interests because the mother's 10-year history of abuse and neglect of her children had been extensive and damaging to the children, and showed that she was not a fit parent; she continued to deny any fault for the youngest child's failure to thrive and insisted that she fed him properly; and she had a long history of complying with requirements of child welfare agencies when necessary before returning to her abusive husband, her illicit drug use, and her patterns of abuse and neglect of her children.

        Evidence amounted to clear and convincing evidence supporting termination of a mother's parental rights based on severe child abuse for physical and psychological damage to the child's half-siblings because the mother slapped one half-sibling and choked her making it difficult for the child to breathe; the child's other half-sibling witnessed the event, and an expert clinical psychologist testified to the harm that would result from being a victim of the assault and having witnessed it.

        Evidence amounted to clear and convincing evidence supporting termination of a mother's parental rights based on severe child abuse because the mother's prenatal drug use constituted severe child abuse; the mother was advised by medical professionals to discontinue her use for the duration of her pregnancy, but she refused, and the child showed signs of developmental delays.

        Evidence found by the trial court amounted to clear and convincing evidence supporting termination of a mother's parental rights based on severe child abuse because the mother drove while intoxicated with the child's half-sibling in the vehicle; that kind of reckless conduct had the potential to cause serious bodily injury and death to the child.

        Evidence was sufficient to terminate the mother's parental rights on the ground of severe child abuse because the child was severely burned on two separate occasions within a one-week period, strongly suggesting that the mother recklessly disregarded the known dangers of a curling iron and a campfire, and she failed to alleviate the child's ongoing pain by seeking appropriate medical treatment.

        In light of other clear and convincing proof that the mother had not remedied the conditions that led to the children's placement with the child placement agency and the trial court's holding that the children were dependent and neglected, certain testimony did not establish, as the mother claimed, that there were no conditions preventing the children's return. In re Antonio J., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 759 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court determined that the children were dependent and neglected as the mother was unable to care for them without the assistance of others, and the trial court approved an agreement that the children remain in child placement agency's custody; there was no basis for the mother's argument that the children were not removed because she voluntarily placed them with the agency, and the order satisfied the persistence of conditions requirement that the child be removed from the parent's home by order of the court. In re Antonio J., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 759 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2018).

        Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her child because the ground of severe child abuse was proven by clear and convincing evidence; the child's brother was injured while in the mother's care and treated for skull fractures and subdural hematoma, for which the mother pleaded guilty to child abuse with serious injuries, unlawful wounding of a child, and cruelty to a child.

        Because a mother was sentenced to more than two years'  imprisonment for conduct against the child's sibling that met the definition of severe child abuse, the trial court did not err in terminating her parental rights.

        In a March 2019 order, the juvenile court found that the father committed severe child abuse against two of the child's siblings for failure to protect them from their mother's drug exposure; as the father did not challenge the finality or validity of the order finding severe child abuse either in the proceedings below or on appeal, the ground of severe child abuse was proven by clear and convincing evidence.

        Construing the language of the adoption and termination statutory scheme, the term “physical custody” as utilized in the statutory sections would be synonymous with having physical possession of a child and would not require a court order or other judicial act; the statutory definition of custody contained in the juvenile court statutory scheme is inapplicable in the context of a termination or adoption proceeding, and physical custody means physical possession of a child, as granted by a parent, guardian, child-placing agency, or court, but physical custody as used in the statutory scheme does not include the unlawful taking of a child.

        Clear and convincing evidence supported the termination of a mother's parental rights to the mother's child on the ground of severe child abuse because the child tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana in hair follicle drug screens during the time when the child was in the care and control of the mother. Furthermore, the mother testified to being aware that using methamphetamine could be harmful to the child, while a doctor testified that ingestion of the drugs could cause immediate and/or long term injury to the child.

The parents'  conduct was knowing as the doctor testified that the mother should have known that serious harm would result, while the father should have recognized that severe child abuse would occur or had already occurred.

        No Tennessee Court has ever held that the appellate court must consider whether the trial court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence of severe abuse in an appeal from a dependency and neglect proceeding in spite of the parents'  failure to properly brief the issue; the court does not interpret a termination of parental rights opinion as requiring review of the severe abuse finding at issue in this neglect case.

        A defendant who was actually a juvenile at the time of the offense, but who was not afforded a transfer hearing in juvenile court prior to his conviction in criminal court, because neither he nor the state knew that he was underage, was deprived of fundamental procedural right and was entitled to remand to trial court for de novo hearing as to whether or not defendant would have been transferred from juvenile to criminal court, based on facts existing at time of his indictment and trial. Sawyers v. State, 814 S.W.2d 725, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 514 (Tenn. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile defendant's right to have transfer order entered in juvenile court before being tried in criminal court is sufficiently fundamental to be considered a matter of due process, in the context of juvenile justice. Consequently, where the error is raised at the first opportunity and there is no suggestion of bad faith on the petitioner's part, it would be patently unfair to conclude that the issue had been “waived,” as that term is contemplated by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c30s40-30-112ol1b" target="_blank">40-30-112(b)</a></cite> (repealed; see now § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.40.html#t40c30s40-30-106" target="_blank">40-30-106</a></cite>).

        Although the definition of an “abandoned child” in former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b1" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(1)</a></cite> [repealed] requires only that the parents fail to visit or support the child for any period of four consecutive months, this section gives the juvenile court the right to terminate the parental rights only in cases where that failure exists for four consecutive months immediately preceding institution of the action or proceeding to declare the child to be an abandoned child by the filing of a petition pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-108" target="_self">37-1-108</a></cite>. West Tennessee Agape, Inc. v. Lipe, 515 S.W.2d 648, 1974 Tenn. App. LEXIS 112 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1974).

       <p>
        For purposes of custody jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the applicable definition of abandonment is that supplied by former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b1" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(1)</a></cite> [repealed] and is not necessarily the same as abandonment for purposes of adoption.

       <p>
        Juvenile court erred in ruling that in the event the father was unable to exercise personal visitation in any month, the paternal grandparents were entitled to exercise his shared parenting time; that conditional order established the grandparents'  visitation fully and completely and was therefore governed by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c06s36-6-306" target="_blank">36-6-306</a></cite>, which allowed visitation rights to grandparents but did not grant jurisdiction to decide grandparental visitation rights. Smallwood v. Mann, 205 S.W.3d 358, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 994 (Tenn. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the chancery court has inherent jurisdiction of the persons and estates of minors, the state has conferred upon juvenile courts the special exclusive jurisdiction to determine custody of a dependent or delinquent minor. State ex rel. Baker v. Turner, 562 S.W.2d 435, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 258 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a finding that a delinquent child has committed any act designated a crime by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, the court has the discretion to “retain jurisdiction and control … until he or she shall have reached the age of twenty-one (21) years,” notwithstanding the Legal Responsibility Act of 1971 lowering the age of minority to age 18. State ex rel. Anglin v. Mitchell, 596 S.W.2d 779, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 415 (Tenn. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not establish jurisdiction in juvenile courts to establish paternity concerning children born during the marriage of the parties. Scales v. Winston, 760 S.W.2d 952, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 456 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        After determining that child was dependent and neglected, juvenile court could not transfer proceedings to change custody to chancery court, thus temporary restraining order issued by the chancellor in the matter was void, and convictions based on violation of such order were overturned. State v. George, 968 S.W.2d 896, 1997 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 754 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997), rehearing denied, State v. Green, — S.W.3d —, 1997 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 863, (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the juvenile court dismissed the petition, exclusive jurisdiction over the matters alleged in it did not attach; thus, the parent's petition for temporary custody that was dismissed by the juvenile court before the petition for custody filed by the other parent did not confer continuing jurisdiction on the juvenile court. P.E.K. v. J.M., 52 S.W.3d 653, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 232 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).

P.E.K. v. J.M., 52 S.W.3d 653, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 232 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the juvenile court dismissed the grandparent's petition for dependency and neglect proceedings, the juvenile court lost jurisdiction, and subject matter jurisdiction remained with the circuit court, that had jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings and the custody issue once the grandparents intervened. Toms v. Toms, 98 S.W.3d 140, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (Tenn. 2003).

       <p>
        When a juvenile court acquires jurisdiction from a dependency and neglect proceeding, its exclusive original jurisdiction continues until one of following events occur: (1) The case is dismissed; (2) The custody determination is transferred to another court; (3) A petition for adoption is filed; or (4) The child reaches the age of 18. In re D.Y.H., 226 S.W.3d 327, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 503 (Tenn. May 24, 2007).

        In a custody dispute between a father from California and the maternal grandparents from Tennessee, the circuit court's order that emergency jurisdiction was to continue indefinitely was erroneous since T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c06s36-6-219ol1b" target="_blank">36-6-219(b)</a></cite> and (c) authorized such jurisdiction only on a temporary basis.

        Chancery court erred in granting the parents'  petition for a writ of certiorari because the chancery court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review a juvenile court's ex parte protective custody order where the chancery court was not a superior court to a juvenile court with regard to dependency and neglect proceedings and a writ of certiorari proceeding did not satisfy either of the types of cases for the chancery court's exercise of jurisdiction. In re Brody S., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 362 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 24, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chancery court's order modifying child support and allocating a tax exemption was void because, before the order was entered, a juvenile court assumed exclusive jurisdiction in a dependency and neglect proceeding concerning the child, depriving the chancery court of subject matter jurisdiction, as (1) no statutory exceptions to the juvenile court's exclusive jurisdiction were present, (2) child support was a component of dependency and neglect proceedings, and (3) the tax exemption was an inevitable part of the juvenile court's decisions. Hance v. Hance, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 252 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 8, 2018).

       <p>
        Court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over a father's appeal of an order awarding permanent guardianship of his child to foster parents because the order was properly appealed to trial court, which retained exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the child; because the record did not indicate that any of the four events specified in subsection occurred, the juvenile court presiding over the dependency and neglect action had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over matters involving the child. In re Brian G., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 507 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the father's petition contained assertions that were tantamount to allegations of dependency and neglect, the juvenile court had exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and all actions taken by the trial court were void. Cox v. Lucas, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 649 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2018), rev'd, 576 S.W.3d 356, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 218 (Tenn. May 29, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father's petition alleged that the child had 10 unexcused absences, for which the child could be deemed habitually truant; because the substance of the father's petition alleged that the child was unruly, the allegations implicated the exclusive original jurisdiction of the juvenile court, and thus the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and all actions taken by the trial court were void. Minyard v. Lucas, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 650 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2018), rev'd, 576 S.W.3d 351, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 230 (Tenn. May 29, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reference to neglect and dependency in the father's pro se petition was a mistake and the action was properly characterized as one to establish paternity and visitation; father sought custody or visitation, and outside of the outdated, incorrect form he used, the only mention made to dependency and neglect was within the proposed order, and the juvenile court struck that language when it learned of the mistake. In re Easton W., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 305 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 1, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court had jurisdiction over a dependency and neglect action where the mother had asserted dependency and neglect in seeking an order of protection from the father, and she had resided in the forum county at the time she filed the petition.

        In the context of a juvenile commitment, “the law of the land” provision of Tenn. Const., art.

        Where the filing of a petition by the department of human services alleging dependency and neglect and the custody order of the juvenile court occurred prior to the custody hearing in circuit court and the order of that court to the effect that custody should remain with father, exclusive jurisdiction had vested in the juvenile court and the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear and decide custody questions pertaining to the children so long as the juvenile court jurisdiction had attached. State Dep't of Human Services v. Gouvitsa, 735 S.W.2d 452, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2595 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>

        The circuit court has no right or power to change custody or to make any orders in regard thereto so long as the matter is pending in juvenile court or unless the juvenile court otherwise consents. Arnold v. Gouvitsa, 735 S.W.2d 458, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2596 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a father's petition for change of custody because the statute was not applicable; the allegations in the petition were not tantamount to allegations of dependency and neglect under the statute but were more in the nature of a disagreement over the long-term manner of addressing the children's psychological, behavioral, and educational issues. Holley v. Holley, 420 S.W.3d 756, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 361 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 31, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 794 (Tenn. Oct. 16, 2013).

        Mother was not entitled to relief from the circuit court's judgment entering a modified Permanent Parenting Plan (PPP) because the father appropriately filed his petition seeking modification of the PPP in the circuit court, which possessed continuing, exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of divorce decrees; the April 18, 2019 amendment to the statute controlled the outcome of the appeal because the appeal was pending on its effective date. Cox v. Lucas, 576 S.W.3d 356, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 218 (Tenn. May 29, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain language of the amendment to the statute, the circuit court was not precluded from exercising domestic relations jurisdiction, regardless of the nature of the allegations of a father's petition for modification of the Permanent Parenting Plan because no pleading had been filed or relief sought in a juvenile court invoking its exclusive original jurisdiction; accordingly, the allegations of the father's petition did not divest the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction.

        Court of appeals did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear a mother's appeal flowing from a dependency and neglect action because jurisdiction was with the circuit court, and thus, it transferred the case to the circuit court; the order from which the mother appealed flowed from the dependency and neglect proceedings, and the trial court lost subject matter jurisdiction over the child with the dismissal of the father's dependency and neglect petition.

        Court of appeals did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the State's appeal of an order denying its motion for relief from an agreed order forgiving a portion of a mother's child support arrearage because jurisdiction was with the circuit court, which assumed subject matter jurisdiction over the children upon the filing of the grandmother's dependency and neglect petition; the agreed order and order denying the State's motion flowed from the dependency and neglect proceedings.

        Where the filing of a petition by the department of human services (now children's services) alleging dependency and neglect and the custody order of the juvenile court occurred prior to the custody hearing in circuit court and the order of that court to the effect that custody should remain with father, exclusive jurisdiction had vested in the juvenile court and the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear and decide custody questions pertaining to the children so long as the juvenile court jurisdiction had attached. State Dep't of Human Services v. Gouvitsa, 735 S.W.2d 452, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2595 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
       </p>

        The circuit court has no right or power to change custody or to make any orders in regard thereto so long as the matter is pending in juvenile court or unless the juvenile court otherwise consents. Arnold v. Gouvitsa, 735 S.W.2d 458, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2596 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).

        Because a mother's petition for a change of custody was a part of the prior dependency and neglect proceeding which granted custody to the father, the juvenile court's order denying the petition was appealable to circuit court for a de novo hearing under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-159ol1a" target="_self">37-1-159(a)</a></cite>; when a juvenile court acquires jurisdiction from a dependency and neglect proceeding, its exclusive original jurisdiction continues until one of following events occur: (1) The case is dismissed; (2) The custody determination is transferred to another court; (3) A petition for adoption is filed; or (4) The child reaches the age of 18, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-103ol1c" target="_self">37-1-103(c)</a></cite>.

        Whether the legislature intended for all grandparent visitation petitions, including those pertaining to children whose parents were never married, to be filed in circuit or chancery court is unclear. Smallwood v. Mann, 205 S.W.3d 358, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 994 (Tenn. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court erred in ruling that in the event the father was unable to exercise personal visitation in any month, the paternal grandparents were entitled to exercise his shared parenting time; that conditional order established the grandparents'  visitation fully and completely and was therefore governed by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c06s36-6-306" target="_blank">36-6-306</a></cite>, which allowed visitation rights to grandparents but did not grant jurisdiction to decide grandparental visitation rights. Smallwood v. Mann, 205 S.W.3d 358, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 994 (Tenn. 2006).
       </p>

        Because the amendment to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c06s36-6-306" target="_blank">36-6-306</a></cite> appeared to clarify a legislative intent that circuit and chancery courts have sole jurisdiction over grandparents'  visitation petitions, the supreme court of Tennessee was constrained to conclude that the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to grant grandparents'  visitation pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-104ol1f" target="_self">37-1-104(f)</a></cite>.

        Although a written notice and a copy of a petition to terminate a father's parental rights filed in the circuit court were not filed with the juvenile court, a lack of further written notice to the juvenile court did not divest the circuit court of its concurrent jurisdiction because the petition for termination of the father's parental rights was no longer pending in the juvenile court upon the State's voluntary dismissal of the initial termination petition. In re Michaela V., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 745 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though a petition for termination of a father's parental rights was filed in a juvenile court, after dependency and neglect proceedings, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider a second petition to terminate the father's parental rights because the circuit court retained concurrent jurisdiction with the juvenile court and the petition filed in juvenile court was voluntarily dismissed by the State nearly contemporaneously with the filing in circuit court. In re Michaela V., — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 745 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2013).

       <p>
        Juvenile court properly set aside its parental visitation order with respect to a child born to married parents as void for lack of jurisdiction because its subject matter jurisdiction only applied to parents of a minor child born out of wedlock. In re Donovyn B.H., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 286 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 16, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in separating grandparents'  termination and adoption actions and transferring only the termination portion of the proceedings to the juvenile court because once the grandparents filed their adoption and termination petition, the trial court acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the matter to the exclusion of all other courts, including the juvenile court; juvenile courts have original jurisdiction to hear termination actions but not adoption petitions. In re Tyler G., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 280 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 3, 2017).

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment rewrote (b) – (g), which read, “(b) The judge may direct that any case or class of cases shall be heard in the first instance by the magistrate in all cases wherein the juvenile court has jurisdiction in the manner provided for the hearing of cases by the court.“(c) A magistrate has the same authority as the judge to issue any and all process. The magistrate in the conduct of the proceedings has the powers of a trial judge.“(d) Upon the conclusion of the hearing in each case, the magistrate shall transmit to the judge all papers relating to the case, together with the magistrate's findings and recommendations in writing. Any hearing by a magistrate on any preliminary matter is final and not reviewable by the judge of the juvenile court, except on the court's own motion. The setting of bond in detention hearings and any matter that is a final adjudication of a juvenile shall not be construed to be a preliminary matter under this section and are reviewable by the judge of the juvenile court upon request or upon the court's own motion as provided in this section.“(e) Any party may, within five (5) days thereafter, excluding nonjudicial days, file a request with the court for a hearing by the judge of the juvenile court. The judge may, on the judge's own motion, order a rehearing of any matter heard before a magistrate, and shall allow a hearing if a request for such hearing is filed as herein prescribed. Unless the judge orders otherwise, the recommendation of the magistrate shall be the decree of the court pending a rehearing.“(f) In case no hearing before the judge is requested, or when the right to a hearing is waived, the findings and recommendations of the magistrate become the decree of the court when confirmed by an order of the judge. The final order of the court is, in any event, proof of such confirmation, and also of the fact that the matter was duly referred to the magistrate. A party may appeal such order pursuant to the provisions of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-159" target="_self">37-1-159</a></cite>.“(g) All prior sections governing the organization, jurisdiction, and management of juvenile courts referred to in this section, that are not in conflict with this section, remain in full force and effect, and all sections in conflict with this section are hereby repealed.”

        In terms of due process, a rehearing pursuant to this section following a full dress hearing before a lawyer-referee (now lawyer-magistrate) is an optional, redundant step. State v. York, 615 S.W.2d 154, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 438 (Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is immaterial whether a rehearing judge is a lawyer or a nonlawyer if the rehearing is preceded by a due process trial before a lawyer-referee (now lawyer-magistrate). State v. York, 615 S.W.2d 154, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 438 (Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The interests of a speedy disposition of juvenile cases, and of due process, are best served by proceeding directly from a lawyer-referee (now lawyer-magistrate) to a de novo hearing before a circuit judge and appellate review, if sought, even if the juvenile judge is also a lawyer. State v. York, 615 S.W.2d 154, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 438 (Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-107" target="_self">37-1-107</a></cite> contemplates a de novo hearing based upon the record of the hearing before the referee (now magistrate), and not a traditional hearing de novo as in an appeal from a general sessions court to a circuit court. Kelly v. Evans, 43 S.W.3d 514, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 828 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although an appellant asserted that a magistrate did not have jurisdiction, under Tenn. R. Juv. P. 4(c) and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-107ol1e" target="_self">37-1-107(e)</a></cite>, to modify a child custody order, any defect in the magistrate's handling of the case was moot because the modification of custody issues were litigated de novo before the juvenile court judge. In re Nathan A-W, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 430 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 26, 2012), appeal dismissed, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 813 (Tenn. Nov. 5, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parent's request for rehearing was timely filed when, dissatisfied with a magistrate's ruling, the parent filed a request for a rehearing before a juvenile court judge within five days of the entry of the magistrate's written order but ten days after the hearing before the magistrate at which the magistrate announced a bench order on the record. As a result of the parent's request filed the same day as the written findings and recommendations, the parent was entitled to a de novo hearing before the juvenile court judge. Sprouse v. Dotson, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 882 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Addition of the term de novo to the statute serves as clarification that the intent of the legislature concerning the nature of a rehearing of a magistrate's decision before a juvenile court judge was in alignment with the court's previous interpretation of the prior versions of the statute. State ex rel. Groesse v. Sumner, 582 S.W.3d 241, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 23 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 18, 2019), appeal denied, State ex rel. Groesse v. Sumner, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 277 (Tenn.

        Referee's order was not a “prior decree of a court” as that term was used in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c06s36-6-101" target="_blank">36-6-101</a></cite>; thus, the juvenile court properly ruled that the proceeding before it was one to establish an initial custody order and that the proper standard of decision was the child's best interest.

        Although the juvenile court erred in taking judicial notice of a paternity test report previously entered as an exhibit in proceedings before a magistrate, the error was harmless because the mother's copy of the report was admissible; because the report showed a statistical probability of paternity of ninety-nine percent or greater, the putative father had an extremely high burden of proof to rebut the statutory presumption of paternity, but he failed to meet that burden. In re Michael J., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 52 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (Tenn. May 16, 2018).

        Inasmuch as a hearing conducted before the juvenile court judge of a matter previously decided by a magistrate is a de novo hearing, the trial court in this case did not err by considering whether the father had violated the 2013 order from the time of the order's entry to the time of the 2016 de novo hearing. State ex rel. Groesse v. Sumner, 582 S.W.3d 241, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 23 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 18, 2019), appeal denied, State ex rel. Groesse v. Sumner, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 277 (Tenn.

        In essence, this section provides that, within a reasonable time of taking a child into custody, the police must either release the child to his parents' custody, bring the child before the court, or place the child in an appropriate detention facility for juveniles, thereby triggering procedural protections relating to the detention of juveniles.

       <p>
        Petitioner was properly denied postconviction relief on his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately advocate for suppression of his pretrial statement where the issue of the voluntariness of petitioner's statement as well as the probable cause supporting the detention that preceded the statement was thoroughly litigated at trial and on appeal, and his claim lacked merit, as he presented no evidence with regard to the time he was taken before the juvenile court and both the trial court and the instant court considered and rejected his claim that the police lacked probable cause to support his custodial interrogation.

       Attorney General Opinions. A juvenile offender who has attained the age of majority before being convicted of an offense by a juvenile court may not be held in an adult facility, such as the local jail; such a defendant may only be held in a juvenile detention facility and may not be held beyond the defendant's nineteenth birthday, regardless of whether the offense is a misdemeanor or a felony, OAG 04-038 (3/12/04).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent absconds from a group home or other non-institutional placement, a petition with a summons should issue; in the event a summons is not effective, the court may issue an order of attachment, OAG 05-008 (1/20/05).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person absconds after turning 18, but while serving a commitment for a juvenile offense, the individual is no longer a child and any offense would be handled as an adult offense, OAG 05-008 (1/20/05).

        Circuit court properly determined that a juvenile's appeal of a juvenile court's determination of delinquency should be dismissed based upon application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. The juvenile had a long history of refusing to cooperate with the juvenile court, the juvenile fled from a rehabilitation facility in which he was placed pursuant to a court order and engaged in additional delinquent acts during that time, and his fugitive status was directly related to the pending appeal.

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment rewrote the section which read: “(a) If a child is brought before the court or delivered to a detention facility designated by the court, the intake or other authorized officer of the court shall immediately make an investigation and release the child unless it appears that such child's detention is warranted or required under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-114" target="_self">37-1-114</a></cite>.“(b)(1) If such child is not so released, a petition under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-120" target="_self">37-1-120</a></cite> shall be made promptly and presented to the court. In the case of a child alleged to be delinquent, a detention hearing shall be held no later than three (3) days after the child is placed in detention to determine whether such child's detention is required under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-114" target="_self">37-1-114</a></cite>. In computing the three (3) days' limitation for purposes of such detention hearing, nonjudicial days are excluded. If a juvenile is detained as provided in § 37-1-114, a detention hearing shall be held no later than eighty-four (84) hours after the child is placed in detention pursuant to § 37-1-114.“(2) In the alternative, if the child is not so released, a warrant committing the child may be sworn out before the court or magistrate by the person producing the child for commitment. Immediately upon receiving a child committed under a warrant, however, the petition shall be made promptly and presented to the court as provided in subdivision (b)(1).“(c) If a child alleged to be dependent and neglected is removed from the custody of such child's parent, guardian or legal custodian prior to a hearing on the petition, a preliminary hearing shall be held no later than three (3) days after the child's removal, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, to determine whether such child's removal is required under § 37-1-114. If the court determines that the child's removal is required under § 37-1-114, the court may order that the child be placed in the custody of a suitable person, persons or agency, as specified in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-116ol1d" target="_self">37-1-116(d)</a></cite>. This subsection (c) may be waived by express and knowing waiver, by the parties to an action including the parents, guardian or legal custodian and the child or guardian ad litem for the child if the child is of tender years. Any such waiver may be revoked at any time, at which time this subsection (c) shall apply. The court shall make every effort to advise the parent, guardian or legal custodian, and the child individually, if fourteen (14) years of age or older or alleged to be delinquent or unruly, of the time, date and place of the hearing and the factual circumstances necessitating the removal.“(d) If the child is not so released, and a parent, guardian or custodian has not been notified of the informal hearing, did not appear or waive appearance at this hearing, and files an affidavit showing these facts, the court shall rehear the matter without unnecessary delay and order such child's release unless it appears from the hearing that the child's detention or shelter care is required under § 37-1-114.“(e) The court, in its discretion, may release the child on an appearance bond.”

       Amendments. The 2018 amendment, in (c)(1), rewrote the first sentence which read: “A child who is provided with court-appointed counsel pursuant to this section, the child’s parents, legal custodians or guardians, or any adult defendant or respondent who is provided with court-appointed counsel pursuant to this section shall be assessed by the court at the time of appointment a nonrefundable administrative fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).”, and in the second sentence substituted “may” for “shall” preceding “be assessed”; in (c)(2), in the second sentence, deleted “child, the” preceding “child’s parents” and substituted “possesses” for “possess” following “respondent”, and, at the end, substituted the present last sentence for “; provided, that willful failure to pay such fee may be weighed by the court when determining appropriate disposition of the case.”; in (c)(4), substituted “a child who has been transferred or is awaiting a transfer hearing pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-134" target="_self">37-1-134</a></cite> or an” for “the child or” preceding “adult” in the second sentence, twice substituted “may” for “shall”, and in the last sentence, substituted “The” for “In cases where a guardian ad litem is appointed, the”; and in (c)(5), in the first sentence, deleted “and with” following “with the court”, deleted “Tennessee” preceding “administrative director”, and inserted “, and the comptroller of the treasury”.

       <p>
        The juvenile judge must consider each case on its merits to determine whether the appointment of counsel is required at a home placement revocation hearing using such criteria as whether the juvenile can speak capably for himself, or whether he alleges in a timely and colorable claim that he has not committed the violation or that there are substantial reasons mitigating the violation which are complex or difficult to present, with any doubt being resolved in favor of appointment of counsel. State ex rel. Gillard v. Cook, 528 S.W.2d 545, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 627 (Tenn. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dependent and neglect proceeding was separate and distinct from the termination proceeding, and the father had counsel appointed for him in the latter proceeding, and the matters of which he complained were matters which were within his power and ability to correct and were the product of his free will; thus the argument that the manner in which the neglect proceeding was handled rendered the father's actions relative to the termination grounds less than willful was rejected. In re Olivia C., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 28 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any due process violation associated with the failure to appoint counsel in a prior dependency and neglect proceeding involving a parent's children was remedied by the procedural protections provided to the parent as a part of the parental termination proceeding. In re Makenzie P., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 737 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 897 (Tenn. Nov. 22, 2016).

        Presuming waiver of counsel from a silent record is impermissible. Mullins v. Lane, 484 F. Supp. 237, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11632 (E.D. Tenn. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of proof that a parent was aware of the termination of parental rights trial date, the appellate court was reluctant to conclude that the parent's failure to appear coupled with appointed counsel's unsupported allegations of lack of communication were sufficient to show that the parent effectively waived the right to appointed counsel. Remand for a new trial, with possible appointment of counsel, was appropriate. In re A.P., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 163 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 29, 2019).

        Under Tennessee Juvenile Courts Act, read in context of federal constitutional principles relating to due process and the assistance of counsel, a juvenile court is required to grant a juvenile the right to counsel in the proceedings involving the question whether such court should waive its exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile as a minor and authorize the juvenile to be subjected to felony prosecutions.

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment deleted (b) which read: “(b)(1) When a petition is filed in the juvenile court alleging a child to be either an abandoned child or a dependent and neglected child, it is the function of the juvenile court, when necessary, to give the child emergency temporary care, and the court shall forthwith refer the case to the county director of public welfare to investigate the social conditions of the child and to report the findings to the court to aid the court in its disposition of the child. The director shall submit such director's findings pursuant to an order from the court. If the child who is the subject of the petition is in the custody of a licensed child-placing agency, or, if the petition is filed by a licensed child-placing agency, the referral may be made to the licensed child-placing agency having custody of the child or filing the petition in lieu of a referral to the director. The court may make informal adjustment of such cases as is provided by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-110" target="_self">37-1-110</a></cite>.“(2)(A) When the court finds, based upon a sworn petition or sworn testimony containing specific factual allegations, that there is probable cause to believe that the conditions specified in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-114ol1a2" target="_self">37-1-114(a)(2)</a></cite> exist and the child is in need of the immediate protection of the court, the court may order that the child be removed from the custody of the child's parent, guardian, legal custodian or the person who physically possesses or controls the child, pending further investigation and hearing for a period not to exceed three (3) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. In no case shall such order remain in effect for more than two (2) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, unless a petition is filed within the two-day period.“(B)(i) If the child is not returned to the parent, guardian or legal custodian within such three-day period, a hearing shall be conducted pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-117ol1c" target="_self">37-1-117(c)</a></cite>.“(ii)(a) Subdivision (b)(2)(B)(i) may be waived by express and knowing waiver, by the parties to an action, including the parents, guardian or legal custodian, and the child or guardian ad litem for the child, if the child is of tender years.“(b) Any such waiver may be revoked at any time, at which time this section shall apply.“(C) In lieu of any disposition of the child authorized by subdivision (b)(2)(B)(ii)(b), the court may, in its discretion, authorize a representative of the department to remain in the child's home with the child until a parent, legal guardian or relative of the child enters the home and expresses a willingness and apparent ability to resume permanent charge of the child, or, in the case of a relative, to assume charge of the child until a parent or legal guardian enters the home and expresses such willingness and apparent ability.”

          If a child alleged to be delinquent or unruly enters a plea of guilty or no contest, or after an adjudicatory hearing, the court may defer further proceedings and place the child on judicial diversion and probation subject to reasonable conditions, which may include completion of substance abuse and mental health treatment services where appropriate, without entering a judgment of guilty and with the consent of the child. For delinquent offenses, such reasonable conditions must be consistent with a validated risk and needs assessment. Probation conditions must not include a period of detention or placing the child in custody of the department, but may include a transfer or grant pursuant to § 37-1-131(a)(1). A child must not be placed on judicial diversion if the delinquent act alleged is an offense described in § 37-1-153(b)(2), if the child has previously been adjudicated delinquent for such an offense, or if the matter is dismissed after a hearing on the merits.

The court shall file written findings of fact that are the basis of its conclusions on that issue within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing or, if an appeal or a petition for certiorari is filed, within five (5) days thereafter, excluding nonjudicial days.

If the court finds the child is in need of treatment and rehabilitation, a dispositional hearing shall be held. If the court finds the child is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation, it shall dismiss the petition and discharge the child from any detention or other restriction. If the court continues its determination of whether the child is in need of treatment and rehabilitation or the dispositional hearing, it shall make an appropriate order for detention of the child or the child's release from detention, subject to supervision of the court during the period of the continuance. In scheduling the hearings, the court shall give priority to proceedings in which a child is in detention or has otherwise been removed from the child's home before an order of disposition has been made. The court shall minimize the use of detention between adjudication and disposition. In no event shall a dispositional hearing be postponed or continued because there is a waitlist for a suitable placement unless the child and, if applicable, the child's attorney, agree to the postponement or continuance in writing.

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment rewrote this section which read: “(a)(1) After hearing the evidence on the petition, the court shall make and file its findings as to whether the child is a dependent or neglected child, or, if the petition alleges that the child is delinquent or unruly, whether the acts ascribed to the child were committed by that child. If the court finds that the child is not a dependent or neglected child or that the allegations of delinquency or unruly conduct have not been established, it shall dismiss the petition and order the child discharged from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered in the proceeding.“(2) If the petition alleged the child was dependent and neglected as defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b12G" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(12)(G)</a></cite>, or if the court so finds regardless of the grounds alleged in the petition, the court shall determine whether the parents or either of them or another person who had custody of the child committed severe child abuse. The court shall file written findings of fact that are the basis of its conclusions on that issue within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing or, if an appeal or a petition for certiorari is filed, within five (5) days thereafter, excluding Sundays.“(b) If the court finds on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child committed the acts by reason of which the child is alleged to be delinquent, it shall proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing to hear evidence as to whether the child is in need of treatment or rehabilitation and to make and file its findings thereon. If the court finds that the child is not in need of treatment or rehabilitation, it may dismiss the proceeding and discharge the child from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the commission of acts that constitute a felony or that reflect recidivistic delinquency is sufficient to sustain a finding that the child is in need of treatment or rehabilitation.“(c) If the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that the child is dependent, neglected or unruly, the court shall proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing to make a proper disposition of the case.“(d) In hearings under subsections (b) and (c), all evidence helpful in determining the questions presented, including oral and written reports, may be received by the court and relied upon to the extent of its probative value even though not otherwise competent in the hearing on the petition. The parties or their counsel shall be afforded an opportunity to examine and controvert written reports so received and to cross-examine individuals making the reports. Sources of confidential information need not be disclosed.“(e)(1) Any order of the court that places custody of a child with the department shall empower the department to select any specific residential or treatment placements or programs for the child according to the determination made by the department, its employees, agents or contractors.“(2) The court may review the residential or treatment placement of a child placed in the department's custody, and within ninety (90) days of the placement, the court may, on its own motion, order a hearing to receive evidence and testimony with regard to the appropriateness of the child's residential or treatment placement. The court shall provide notice of the hearing to the department, to the child's biological parent or parents, and any other person who has been primarily responsible for the care of the child during the twelve (12) months prior to the child's placement in the department's custody. The court shall allow thirty (30) days from the time such notices are sent before the hearing date is set. The court shall issue a placement recommendation based on a preponderance of the evidence to the department within ten (10) days after the conclusion of the hearing. Upon receiving the court's recommendation, the department shall issue a determination as to the child's placement within fifteen (15) days. The department shall notify the court, the child's biological parent or parents, and any other person who has been primarily responsible for the care of the child during the twelve (12) months prior to the child's placement.“(f) On its own motion or that of a party, the court may continue the hearings under this section for a reasonable period to receive reports and other evidence bearing on the disposition or the need for treatment or rehabilitation. In this event, the court shall make an appropriate order for detention of the child, or the child's release from detention, subject to supervision of the court during the period of the continuance. In scheduling investigations and hearings, the court shall give priority to proceedings in which a child is in detention or has otherwise been removed from the child's home before an order of disposition has been made.”

       The 2017 amendment substituted “§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b13G" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(13)(G)</a></cite>” for “§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102ol1b12G" target="_self">37-1-102(b)(12)(G)</a></cite>” in the first sentence of (b)(2).

      <p>
       The 2018 amendment, effective July 1, 2019, in (a)(1), in the first sentence, substituted “subject to reasonable conditions which may include completion of substance abuse and mental health treatment services where appropriate,” for “upon such reasonable conditions as it may require” and inserted “, and, for delinquent offenses, such reasonable conditions shall be consistent with a validated risk and needs assessment”, and in the second sentence, inserted “, but may include a transfer or grant pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-131ol1a1" target="_self">37-1-131(a)(1)</a></cite>”; added (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B); in the present introductory language of (a)(2), substituted “court, subject to this subdivision (a)(2). Before” for “court. Upon application of any party, to the proceedings, made before” preceding “expiration”, substituted “the court may extend judicial diversion” for “judicial diversion may be extended by the court” preceding “for an additional”, inserted “period not to exceed”, and added “, but only if the court finds and issues a written order that:”; added present (3)(A) and redesignated former (a)(3) as (a)(3)(B); and, in (a)(3)(B), substituted “judiciary” for “judicial” preceding “diversion”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2019 amendment rewrote (a)(1), which read: “If a child alleged to be delinquent or unruly enters a plea of guilty or no contest, the court may defer further proceedings and place the child on probation subject to reasonable conditions, which may include completion of substance abuse and mental health treatment services where appropriate, without entering a judgment of guilty and with the consent of the child, and, for delinquent offenses, such reasonable conditions shall be consistent with a validated risk and needs assessment. Probation conditions shall not include a period of detention or placing the child in custody of the department, but may include a transfer or grant pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-131ol1a1" target="_self">37-1-131(a)(1)</a></cite>. A child shall not be placed on judicial diversion if the delinquent act alleged is an offense described in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-153ol1b" target="_self">37-1-153(b)</a></cite> or if the child has previously been adjudicated delinquent for such an offense.”

        T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129ol1c" target="_self">37-1-129(c)</a></cite> expressly limited the court's power to direct the placement of a child in the custody of the Department of Children's Services and nothing in the broad grant of jurisdiction to the chancery court exempted it from that limitation. In re Neveah W., 470 S.W.3d 807, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 197 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 2, 2015).

        While the trial court acknowledged error in its assumption that it was dealing with a neglect and dependency case, the court did not apply an incorrect standard of proof to a mother's petition to suspend visitation, as implicit in the court's affirmative finding that the father did not abuse the parties'  child was the conclusion that the mother did not prove abuse by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Jonathan S. C-B, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 924 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2011), rehearing denied, In re Jonathan S. C. B., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 603 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        To find the child dependent and neglected, the children's services department did not need to show direct evidence of abuse; it was clear the child suffered abuse while in the care of the mother and father, it was not incumbent on the court to determine which one abused the child, and the claim by the mother and father that they were unaware of how they inflicted the injury on the child was irrelevant.

        The court is not required to state on the face of the order that there was clear and convincing evidence to support its finding. In re Dunigan, 658 S.W.2d 112, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied a mother's motion to modify a temporary order giving custody of her special needs child to the grandparents because the trial court specifically stated the evidence showed there was a danger of mental harm to the child if she were returned to the mother's custody “separate and apart from any attachment theory,” and there was no reason to believe the trial court based its decision primarily on a psychologist's description of the child's bond with the grandparents. In re Hannah v. S., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 849 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 7, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court's procedure violated applicable statutes and Rules of Juvenile Procedure because (1) the record contained no adjudicatory or dispositional order, (2) a “Knox County Juvenile Court Plan of Probation” contained no required findings, so there was no finding that a delinquent charge was proven beyond a reasonable doubt or that a juvenile was in need of treatment or rehabilitation, nor did the juvenile receive written warning of the consequences of violating a court order, and (3) the court delayed resolution of the proceeding indefinitely, contrary to the time limits in Tenn. R. Juv. P. 17 and 18. In re Addison M., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 896 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's treatment of child 1 had gotten progressively worse and posed a risk that child 2 might, in the absence of action by the Tennessee Department of Children's Services, suffer abuse. The evidence did not preponderate against the trial court's findings that both children were dependent and neglected in their mother's care. In re B.B., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 517 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 763 (Tenn. Nov. 16, 2017).

        The term “clear and convincing” is a relative term and must be examined in light of the facts of each particular case. In re Dunigan, 658 S.W.2d 112, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in holding that child was dependent and neglected and had suffered “severe abuse”, as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, while in the care of his parents; expert medical testimony was overwhelming that the injuries to the child could not have occurred in the way the parents claimed, that the injuries occurred while the child was very young, and that the injuries were multiple, very serious, inflicted on separate occasions with great force, and not self- or accidentally inflicted. In re N.T.B., 205 S.W.3d 499, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, In re N. T. B., — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 721 (Tenn. Aug. 21, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was clear and convincing evidence that father engaged in severe child abuse because: (1) Several child witnesses stated that they observed him raping and/or sexually assaulting his daughter and one of her friends, both under the age of 13; (2) Children's testimony was corroborated by medical experts and the testimony of other professionals; (3) Children's statements were validated by numerous exhibits, photographs, magazines, videos, and “sex toys,” which the children accurately identified; (4) Father's 10-year-old son witnessed him having sex with the daughter; and (5) Father exposed the boys to his sexual abuse of at least two minor girls, to “sex toys,” to the parents'  sexual activity, and to numerous and varied pornographic materials; thus, circuit court properly found that the children were dependent and neglected because the children were severely abused, father injured or endangered the morals or health of his children or others, and father was unfit to care for them. In re H.L.F., 297 S.W.3d 223, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was clear and convincing evidence that mother committed severe child abuse under Tenn. Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> because by deliberately and recklessly ignoring father's pedophilic interests, mother knowingly failed to protect her daughter from being raped by father and failed to protect her sons who were exposed to father's acts and the sexual environment that existed in her home; accordingly, circuit court properly found that the children were dependent and neglected because they suffered from severe abuse, mother injured or endangered her children's health, and mother was unfit to care for the children. In re H.L.F., 297 S.W.3d 223, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2009).

The full extent of his injuries might not be known until the child was well into his childhood. Cornelius v. Dep't of Children's Servs., 314 S.W.3d 902, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 419 (Tenn. Ct.

       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the lack of physical abuse towards two children, a mother's severe abuse against the children's sibling provided clear and convincing evidence that the mother provided “improper guardianship or control so as to injure or endanger the morals or health” of the two children, so as to render them dependent and neglected, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>. State v. Byrd, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 105 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2012), appeal denied, In re Morgan R., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 227 (Tenn. Apr. 12, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dependency and neglect proceedings, despite the absence of direct evidence of severe child abuse by a mother, clear and convincing evidence supported a trial court's finding that the child's injuries occurred while he was with the mother, the injuries were caused by either the mother or her husband, and the non-abuser knowingly or recklessly disregarded the other's abusive actions, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>; the child had suffered facial bruises, liver lacerations, and multiple broken bones.

       </p>
       <p>
        In dependency and neglect proceedings, clear and convincing evidence did not support a trial court's finding that a father severely abused his eight-month-old child, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129" target="_self">37-1-129</a></cite>, because the father was absent from the home on the day the child was injured and there was a lack of proof the child and his siblings were abused prior to that date. In re Dakota C.R., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 265 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2012).
       </p>

        In dependency and neglect proceedings, clear and convincing evidence supported a trial court's finding that a mother severely abused her eight-month-old child, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129" target="_self">37-1-129</a></cite>, because the mother's story of how the injuries were inflicted by the child's eighteen-month-old sibling was implausible and, instead, more plausible was that the injuries were inflicted by the only adult present that night, the mother; however, even if the child's injuries were somehow inflicted by the sibling, the mother certainly would have heard the commotion and should have intervened sooner in order to prevent serious injury.

        When a mother's explanation that a child's leg was broken while being extracted from a crib was juxtaposed against a doctor's testimony that the break likely occurred due to a blow, and the doctor's testimony was considered as a whole, the evidence preponderated in favor of a factual finding that the child's femur fracture did not occur in the manner the mother suggested but was the result of nonaccidental trauma. When that fact was considered along with the other evidence of multiple rib fractures, skull fractures and a failure to provide sufficient nutrition, the evidence was clear and convincing that the mother committed severe child abuse. In re S.J., 387 S.W.3d 576, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2012), appeal denied, In re Shanira J., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 757 (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2012).

        Clear and convincing evidence supported a trial court's finding that a child was dependent and neglected, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129ol1a2" target="_self">37-1-129(a)(2)</a></cite>, because the child provided consistent disclosures to two therapists of abundant accounts of severe child abuse, including rape, incest, and aggravated sexual battery, perpetrated by his mother and other adults around the mother; the mother, among other transgressions, raped the child when he was around age ten or eleven.

        Trial court properly denied a mother's motion to modify a temporary order giving custody of her special needs child to the grandparents, resulting from a finding of dependency and neglect, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, because the grandparents established by clear and convincing evidence the child would face a risk of substantial harm if custody were awarded to the mother, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129" target="_self">37-1-129</a></cite>; the grandparents were addressing the child's medical and educational needs while the mother was unaware of those needs.

       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported a determination that a one-year-old child was dependent and neglected upon a finding that the father knowingly engaged in severe child abuse because the father became aggressive when approached by the police and began to grab the child around his head and neck in a manner the officers deemed was likely to cause severe harm or death to the child; the officer dealing directly with the father believed he was going to break the child's neck.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that a child had suffered severe child abuse by her father for purposes of being adjudicated dependent and neglected; the evidence clearly and convincingly showed that the father had touched the child and penetrated her vagina with his finger. In re Kaitlynne D., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 297 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 21, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was undisputed that the child suffered severe child abuse, and the mother's claim that she did not knowingly fail to protect him was rejected; weeks prior to the child's nonaccidental brain bleeding injury, he suffered another such injury, which would have caused noticeable symptoms, but the mother never reported the injury, and her failure to protect the child despite having been presented with facts from which she should have recognized that severe abuse either had occurred or likely would occur was sufficient to support the finding that she committed severe child abuse. In re Colby W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 30, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the trial court's adjudication of the child as a dependent and neglected child, given that none of the possible causes proposed by the mother had any evidentiary support, the child suffered two separate brain bleeding injuries that were unexplained, a doctor testified that the second injury was the result of abusive trauma, and it was clear that the child was abused while in the care of the mother and father. In re Colby W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 30, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that the three-year-old child was a victim of severe child abuse by aggravated sexual battery, in finding both of the father's children to be dependent and neglected, in enjoining him from having any contact with his two daughters, and in placing sole custody of the children with the mother because the evidence presented to the trial court against the father rose to the level of clear and convincing as the child made multiple disclosures to multiple people that the father poked, rubbed, and otherwise touched her privates; the child's privates were irritated upon return from visitation with the father; and the child had consistently identified only the father as the perpetrator of those actions.

       <p>
        Circuit court erred in finding a child dependent and neglected and in awarding custody of the child jointly to the child's parent and grandparent, based on the parent's stipulation of dependency and neglect, because the record lacked clear and convincing evidence that the child was dependent and neglected as of the date of the de novo hearing by the court.

       <p>
        Parent's youngest children were dependent and neglected based upon a finding that the parent committed severe child abuse against the parent's oldest child because credible evidence supported a finding that the parent committed severe child abuse in that the parent was responsible for the child's injuries by the parent's knowing use of force as the child suffered a liver laceration, an injury, which a doctor opined occurred as a result of significant trauma, that constituted a serious bodily injury to the child. In re Damian M., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 738 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (Tenn. Jan. 19, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Four-year-old child made disclosures of sexual abuse by the father, and any inconsistency in the disclosures did not go to whether sexual abuse occurred; the child was dependent and neglected and a victim of sexual abuse by the father. In re M.D., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 746 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in adjudicating the child dependent and neglected because, even disregarding the medical records of a crisis stabilization unit, the evidence clearly and convincingly established that, at the time of the hearing, the mother's mental incapacity rendered her unfit and unable to properly care for her child as a senior psychological examiner diagnosed the mother with an adjustment disorder with anxiety and recommended treatment; the examiner agreed that, without treatment, the mother was at risk for continued overreaction to events she found stressful; and, while the examiner expected the mother's condition to improve, that expectation was predicated on her participation in counseling and therapy.

        Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's determination that the children were dependent and neglected while in the parents'  care given the children's testimony describing persistent physical and verbal abuse, unsanitary living conditions, and the emotional trauma suffered as a result.

        Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's finding that a mothers'  children were dependent and neglected, when one child was a victim of aggravated child abuse by the father, because the court considered the mother's Alford plea to child endangerment in reaching its decision that the mother committed child endangerment and in concluding that the mother's act of child endangerment resulted in serious bodily injury to the child as a doctor testified that the child suffered brain injuries a result of abusive head trauma.

        In a dependency and neglect case, the finding that the child was dependent and neglected and that the child's best interests were served by remaining in the custody of his maternal uncle and aunt was proper because the circuit court did not err by hearing adjudicatory and dispositional proof at the same hearing, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129ol1c" target="_self">37-1-129(c)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-130ol1a" target="_self">37-1-130(a)</a></cite>.

        The custody arrangements made in cases involving dependent, neglected, abandoned or unruly children, does not constitute confinement or deprivation of liberty. State ex rel. Anglin v. Mitchell, 596 S.W.2d 779, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 415 (Tenn. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Divestment of custody of a mother's child from the Department of Children's Services to a maternal aunt did not constitute de facto termination of the mother's parental rights because the mother remained the child's mother and retained the right to visit the child and to petition the trial court to return custody to her; the transfer of legal custody or the creation of a permanent guardianship does not end the parent-child relationship, T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-140ol1a" target="_self">37-1-140(a)</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-803ol1a" target="_self">37-1-803(a)</a></cite>.

        Trial court properly denied a mother's motion to modify a temporary order giving custody of her special needs child to the grandparents, resulting from a finding of dependency and neglect, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, because the grandparents established by clear and convincing evidence the child would face a risk of substantial harm if custody were awarded to the mother, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-129" target="_self">37-1-129</a></cite>; the grandparents were addressing the child's medical and educational needs while the mother was unaware of those needs.

        In a case where the trial court found that the three-year-old child was a victim of severe child abuse by aggravated sexual battery, the trial court acted within its authority in ordering the father not to contact the mother; and in denying the father visitation with his daughters.

       <p>
        After finding that the children were dependent and neglected, the trial court did not err by ordering that one child live with his paternal grandfather and the other child live with his maternal grandparents because there is no suggestion that the injuries one child sustained in his grandfather's care were of an abusive sort, the grandfather testified that he would not employ disciplinary techniques he had used against the father in the future, the record showed that the children were in good, stable households where their best interests are advanced, and the children would continue to see each other.

In re H.L.F., 297 S.W.3d 223, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2009).

       <p>
        There was clear and convincing evidence that father engaged in severe child abuse because: (1) Several child witnesses stated that they observed him raping and/or sexually assaulting his daughter and one of her friends, both under the age of 13; (2) Children's testimony was corroborated by medical experts and the testimony of other professionals; (3) Children's statements were validated by numerous exhibits, photographs, magazines, videos, and “sex toys,” which the children accurately identified; (4) Father's 10-year-old son witnessed him having sex with the daughter; and (5) Father exposed the boys to his sexual abuse of at least two minor girls, to “sex toys,” to the parents'  sexual activity, and to numerous and varied pornographic materials; thus, circuit court properly found that the children were dependent and neglected because the children were severely abused, father injured or endangered the morals or health of his children or others, and father was unfit to care for them.

        Mother's conduct in failing to feed her youngest child appropriately and failing to seek medical care for him constituted severe child abuse because an expert testified that the mother's actions of neglect toward the child resulting in severe nutritional malnourishment could produce severe developmental delay or intellectual disability in the child, and was likely to cause serious bodily injury or death; she admitted to hospital personnel that she noticed that the child was not growing approximately three months before he was admitted to the hospital; the mother was aware that it was not appropriate for the child to gain only eight ounces in six months; and, despite that knowledge, she did not seek medical treatment for the child.

        The commingling of status offenders with delinquent children in secure penal facilities operated for delinquent children is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose and is therefore punishment; and, as this confinement amounts to punishment without an adjudication of guilt, the practice violates the principles of substantive due process under the Tennessee and U.S. constitutions. Doe v. Norris, 751 S.W.2d 834, 1988 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (Tenn. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the state's interest in protecting status offenders from harm is a compelling interest, the state's practice of placing status offenders in secure penal facilities and commingling them with delinquent offenders is not a practice “precisely tailored” to serve this compelling interest. Therefore, this practice violates the guarantees of equal protection under the Tennessee and U.S. constitutions. Doe v. Norris, 751 S.W.2d 834, 1988 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (Tenn. 1988).

        Criminal Court did not err in committing a juvenile to the custody of the Department of Children's Services (DCS) for an indefinite term because the juvenile's probation had been extended multiple times, he had pleaded guilty to three violations of probation, and the Court could impose any disposition that was permissible in an original proceeding, one of which was to commit him to DCS.

        Trial court did not err by finding that defendant violated his probation and ordering that he be committed to Department of Children's Services custody because defendant violated his Serious Habitual Offender Community Action Program (SHOCAP) probation by failing to report to his probation officer; defendant and his mother agreed to the terms of the SHOCAP probation, including the reporting requirement, and the trial court found that his violations were intentional and deliberate.

       <p>
        Order directing defendant juvenile to pay restitution of over $9,000 at the rate of $50 a month was not improper because the parties agreed that the amount of restitution ordered reflected the monetary damages of the victim; the restitution statute applicable in juvenile cases did not require the court to consider the financial resources and future ability of defendant to pay or perform; defendant's claim that she was unable to remit restitution based on her family's limited means was misplaced as the restitution order was her responsibility, not her family's responsibility; and requiring restitution would aid in defendant's rehabilitation by requiring her to earn funds commensurate with the damages sustained by the victim.

        If the child is found to be an unruly child, the court may make such disposition as authorized by this section or § 37-1-131(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(7), or (b) that is best suited to such child's treatment. However, no child found to be an unruly child may be placed on probation under the supervision of the department, unless such child is found to also be a delinquent child or is found to have committed a violation of a valid court order as provided for in the Appendix to the Tennessee Rules of Juvenile Procedure. No county government shall be required to increase local funding to implement this provision. The court has the additional dispositional alternative of ordering the department to provide non-custodial services to a child found to be unruly.

If a hearing is not set nor a written objection received within fifteen (15) days of the date of the notice, the department may place the child on a trial home visit. The notice shall include the provision that the department's legal custody of the child shall terminate in thirty (30) days.“(2) If during the thirty-day period the department determines that the trial home visit is not in the child's best interest and removes the child on an emergency basis or seeks to remove the child on a non-emergency basis, the department shall file a motion for review by the court of the trial home visit and shall provide notice to the parent(s), guardian or other custodian. The court shall hold a hearing on such motion within three (3) days of an emergency removal and shall set a hearing within fifteen (15) days to be held at the earliest possible date if the motion seeks the court's permission to make a non-emergency removal.“(3) During the thirty-day trial home visit, the court may periodically review the child's status and may make any orders that the best interest of the child may require.”; and added (c)(4) through (c)(6).

        Where a child was adjudicated to be unruly for the first time by the juvenile court judge or referee (now magistrate), it was a violation of this section to commit her to the department even though she was on probation as a result of several “unruly” petitions previously filed against her, as such previous petitions had been handled by informal conferences with the state and juvenile court probation personnel.

        The commingling of status offenders with delinquent children in secure penal facilities operated for delinquent children is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose and is therefore punishment and, as this confinement amounts to punishment without an adjudication of guilt, the practice violates the principles of substantive due process under the Tennessee and U.S. constitutions. Doe v. Norris, 751 S.W.2d 834, 1988 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (Tenn. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the state's interest in protecting status offenders from harm is a compelling interest, the state's practice of placing status offenders in secure penal facilities and commingling them with delinquent offenders is not a practice “precisely tailored” to serve this compelling interest. Therefore this practice violates the guarantees of equal protection under the Tennessee and U.S. constitutions. Doe v. Norris, 751 S.W.2d 834, 1988 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (Tenn. 1988).

       <p>
        In State v. Morgan, 541 S.W.2d 385, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 544 (Tenn. 1976), the supreme court of Tennessee adopted Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence concerning the impeachment of a witness by evidence of a criminal conviction. The rule provided that a witness may be impeached by evidence of a conviction for any crime involving dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment, or by evidence of a conviction for a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year if the court determined that the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect. The question of whether a particular conviction was admissible was to be determined by the trial judge out of the presence of the jury. All convictions over ten years old were presumptively inadmissible unless the court determined that the probative value of the evidence of the conviction substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect and the party who intended to introduce the evidence gave the adverse party “sufficient advance written notice” of intent to use the conviction to impeach. The ten-year time limitation was measured from the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement, whichever was later. (See now Tenn. R. Evid. 609). State v. Davis, 741 S.W.2d 120, 1987 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 2654 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987).

        When evidence is going to be offered to impeach under State v. Morgan, 541 S.W.2d 385, 1976 Tenn.

        Although juvenile proceedings do, in many ways, partake of civil rather than criminal proceedings, the juvenile has a right to counsel, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to have guilt established beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Where the trial court allowed the state to ask a character witness for defendant, who further testified as to the good character of the defendant, if he knew that it was part of defendant's reputation that he had been charged with various offenses in juvenile court, since the questions did not relate to the disposition of the juvenile or of evidence adduced against him and the court charged at the time that the jury was to only consider this as affecting the credibility of the witness and recharging this at the conclusion of all the proof, there was no violation of subsection (b).

        Under the Tennessee Juvenile Courts Act, read in context of federal constitutional principles relating to due process and the assistance of counsel, a juvenile court is required to grant a juvenile the right to counsel in the proceedings involving the question whether such court should waive its exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile as a minor and authorize the juvenile to be subjected to felony prosecutions.

        The court declined to disturb the juvenile court's exercise of discretion and concluded that the record of transfer hearing amply supported the court's finding of reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile committed the offenses to which he had confessed.

        A juvenile court is precluded under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-134ol1a4B" target="_self">37-1-134(a)(4)(B)</a></cite> from transferring juveniles to criminal court when those juveniles are subject to the “involuntary commitment” procedures of T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.33.html#t33c06s33-6-401" target="_blank">33-6-401</a></cite> et. seq; amenability to “voluntary admission” of the juvenile pursuant to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.33.html#t33c06s33-6-201" target="_blank">33-6-201</a></cite> et. seq. does not prohibit a transfer of the juvenile to criminal court for trial as an adult.

       <p>
        In a juvenile defendant's murder case, although counsel was deficient for failing to secure an expert's mental evaluation of defendant and for failing to present the expert's findings during the juvenile transfer hearing, the error was harmless; in light of the inconsistencies between experts that defendant was not committable to a mental institution, even if defense counsel had presented the expert's report at the transfer hearing, the juvenile court would have had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was not committable. Howell v. State, 185 S.W.3d 319, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 190 (Tenn. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court properly considered the factors enumerated in the statute, finding that petitioner juvenile met the requirements for transfer to criminal court, and it was reasonable for the juvenile court to believe that he committed the crimes for which he was charged and that the interests of the community required that he be put under legal restraint or discipline; because petitioner met the criteria, the juvenile court was required to transfer his case to the criminal court. Mayes v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1120 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 18, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 309 (Tenn. Apr. 11, 2014).

       <p>
        As there was no objection to having a witness read her responses from a juvenile court transfer hearing transcript, any issue in this regard was waived, but waiver notwithstanding, her prior testimony was admissible because she was an unavailable witness based on a lack of memory, and there was no question that her prior testimony from the transfer hearing was reliable, even though it was hearsay, because defendants had a similar motive and chance to cross-examine her in that hearing.

The juvenile court's observation that no evidence regarding rehabilitation had been presented by either side did not transform this statutory factor into an affirmative defense. State v.

        Even though the court held that defendant was entitled to Brady material at the juvenile transfer hearing, the information concerning other potential suspects was neither favorable nor material to the hearing because the individuals did not appear to be legitimate suspects but rather stray leads that were dismissed early in the case.

        T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-134ol1c" target="_self">37-1-134(c)</a></cite> clearly contemplates that following the transfer hearing and the termination of the juvenile court's jurisdiction, a defendant may be charged in an adult court with other criminal offenses.

        Where defendant was transferred to a criminal court, the defendant no longer had the benefit of statutes expressly applicable to children, and due process did not preclude the application of the statute of limitations to defendant's post-conviction petition, because defendant's status as a minor was not enough to make a prima facie showing of incompetence to toll the limitations period. Stewart v. State, 95 S.W.3d 229, 2002 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 700 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2002), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2002 Tenn. LEXIS 747 (Tenn. Dec. 23, 2002).

        Where there was probable cause to believe that defendant committed the delinquent act, and in view of defendant's record of previous delinquencies and the juvenile judge's opinion that he was not amenable to rehabilitation, there was no error in transferring defendant to the circuit court to be tried as an adult.

        There was sufficient proof that the interest of the community required that the defendant be put under legal restraint or discipline to support the trial judge's decision to accept the defendant for treatment as an adult.

        Juvenile court did not err in transferring defendant to criminal court because, from the record, it appeared that the juvenile court was presented with probable cause to conclude that defendant was not committable to an institution for either the mentally disabled or the mentally ill and that the interests of the community would be best served by legal restraint.

        Review of juvenile court's transfer order is not to be determined on the basis of the appellate court's conception of the preponderance of the evidence, and where the defendant was accused of participation in armed robbery the juvenile court could reasonably determine that he should be tried as an adult.

       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider defendant's appeal because, while he utilized the proper method for challenging the juvenile court's decision at his transfer hearing and despite his substantially narrower statement of the issue on appeal, his certified questions were overly broad; they merely recited the basic statutory language of the transfer statute, did not state why he was entitled to relief, or particularly identify how the trial court failed to follow the statute; and, although defendant filed a motion to supplement the appellate record with a transcript and included a copy of the juvenile transfer hearing transcript as an attachment, he did not file the transcript with the trial court clerk.

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Where petitioner was convicted as an adult of a murder he committed at age 14, while his trial counsel was deficient for failing to present mental health testimony at the T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-134" target="_self">37-1-134</a></cite> transfer hearing, petitioner did not show he was prejudiced thereby because he failed to demonstrate that, had counsel not advised him to waive the transfer hearing and all the evidence was presented at that hearing, there would have been no transfer. Clinard v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1040 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 17, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 474 (Tenn. May 8, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although transfer counsel's representation was deficient due to his failure to properly investigate and prepare the case, petitioner juvenile failed to demonstrate that the deficient performance prejudiced him because counsel testified that almost all first-degree murder cases were transferred to the criminal court; petitioner had prior contacts with the juvenile court, the case involved an aggressive, premeditated offense against a person, and it was gang-related. Mayes v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1120 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 18, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 309 (Tenn. Apr. 11, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel admitted she incorrectly told petitioner that her transfer hearing testimony could be used against her at trial, but counsel also did not want petitioner to testify because of concern petitioner would be unable to control her temper on the witness stand, and no theory of defense was abandoned, and thus ineffective assistance was not shown in this regard and the denial of post-conviction relief was affirmed. Brown v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1014 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 6, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. May 15, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, whose attorney agreed to his transfer from juvenile court to adult court in a murder case, was entitled to habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel; in finding that defendant was not prejudiced, the state postconviction appellate court ignored its own factual finding that, in the mind of the judge who presided over the transfer hearing, the issue of transfer was very much in doubt when defendant's attorney agreed to waive the hearing. Clinard v. Lee,  — F.3d —, 2018 FED App. 93N, 722 Fed. Appx. 552, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 4780 (6th Cir. Feb. 27, 2018), cert. denied, <cite class="l_ed">202 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner failed to demonstrate that counsel was deficient in waiving the transfer hearing and thus he was not entitled to post-conviction relief; counsel testified that the decision to waive the hearing was strategic so he was able to negotiate a bond, which petitioner wanted. Furthermore, petitioner failed to present any evidence that he would have been successful in preventing his case from being transferred if he had had a transfer hearing, and thus he also failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced. Perkins v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 19, 2020), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 323 (Tenn. June 3, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner failed to show his trial counsel was ineffective for waiving the juvenile transfer hearing, and therefore he was properly denied postconviction relief, because counsel testified that he waived the hearing to obtain open discovery and other advantages, that the juvenile judge always approved motions to transfer, and that it would have been fruitless to hold the hearing. In addition, a psychological exam indicated that petitioner was not committable to a psychiatric facility and that he could be transferred to adult court, and therefore the record did not contain evidence that petitioner would have been successful in preventing his case from being transferred if a transfer hearing had been conducted. Siler v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 197 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 24, 2020), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 424 (Tenn. Aug. 7, 2020).

       <p>
        All requirements were met to transfer the juvenile to the custody of the circuit court because an expert stated that while the juvenile was mentally ill he was not committable to a psychiatric institution, and the juvenile court did not restrict the juvenile's cross-examination of the expert. State v. Brown, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 673 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 7, 2013), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 1015 (Tenn. Dec. 10, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a transfer to criminal court was appropriate because, while defendant had no prior record, committed only crimes against property, and had no criminal gang associations, the court gave greater weight to its findings that the acts of vandalism by defendant were aggressive and premeditated, defendant was not amenable to rehabilitation as defendant had evidenced a sustained intent to violate the law which spanned multiple days, and the interests of the community required transfer. State v. Eckert, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 25, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court did not err by transferring defendant's case to criminal court because the record showed that it had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant committed first-degree felony murder and it was concerned with the amount of time left to rehabilitate defendant in the juvenile system based on his age, 17.

The request shall state the reasons for recommending the early release placement and shall make specific recommendations as to where the child will be placed. A copy of the request for a hearing shall be supplied to the district attorney general. If, on review of the record, the court is of the opinion that the request is well taken and the district attorney general has no objection, the judge may order the early release placement without a hearing. Otherwise, the court shall schedule a hearing within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the request for hearing. At the hearing, the department, the juvenile offender, and the state shall be given an opportunity to be heard in support of or in opposition to the proposed early release placement and all of the parties may subpoena witnesses to testify on any issue raised by the proposed placement. The court may make such orders pertaining to such placement as the court determines are justified under the proof produced at the hearing for such early release placement.

The written notice shall contain a copy of the petition and any other written report or statement detailing the violation or violations as well as the time, place, and purpose of the hearing.

      <p>
       Acts 2018, ch. 1052, § 55 provided that it is the intent of the general assembly that improvements to the juvenile justice system and expansion of community-based resources for justice-involved children be prioritized, including, but not limited to, evidence-based programs, informal adjustment, diversion, home placement supervision, statewide data collection, early intervention programs and services for children and families, and mental health services, especially in any county underserved with such programs and services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendments. The 2018 amendment by ch. 1052, § 41, effective July 1, 2018, in (e), at the end of the first sentence, inserted “supervision”, and, in the second sentence, substituted “petition is filed alleging a violation of home placement supervision” for “child is placed in detention” following “seven (7) days of the time” and “parent or parents” for “parent(s)” preceding “guardian”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2018 amendment by ch. 1052, §§ 39, 40, and 42, effective July 1, 2019, added (b)(1); and, in present (b)(2), substituted “monthly” for “quarterly” following “reviewed” and “quarterly” for “semiannually” at the end; redesignated former (d)(1) as present (d)(1)(A) and (d)(1)(B); in (d)(1)(A), substituted “; provided, that, unless a new petition has been filed alleging the child has committed a new delinquent offense or habitual and unlawful absence pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.49.html#t49c06s49-6-3007" target="_blank">49-6-3007</a></cite>, the court, in its discretion, may direct the designee that, in some or all circumstances, such a petition should be filed only if the designee makes and documents attempts to address the noncompliant behavior and determines and documents the reasons for which court intervention is needed to address the noncompliance.” for “Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the court” following “a violation of home placement supervision”; in present (d)(1)(B), inserted “The court”, “, but only in accordance with § 37-1104”, and “by incurring an adjudication of delinquency for a new offense that meets the eligibility criteria for commitment to the department under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-131ol1a4" target="_self">37-1-131(a)(4)</a></cite>”; in (d)(2), substituted “but only if the child cannot be located by the designee after documented efforts to locate the child or a new petition has been filed alleging the child has committed a delinquent offense arising from a separate incident from the original petition. A” for “at its discretion, except that” preceding “notice of such removal”; added present (f)(3); redesignated the former introductory language of (f) as present (f)(1) and deleted “If the court finds that:” at the end; rewrote former (f)(1) and (f)(2) which read:“(1) A violation has occurred; and“(2) The violation was serious enough to justify termination, it shall order that the child be re-committed to the department. Such order shall contain the reasons relied on for terminating the home placement. Upon such termination, the child may be placed as the commissioner or the commissioner's designee may direct. The child may appeal the disposition of the court as provided in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-159" target="_self">37-1-159</a></cite>.”, and redesignated them as present (f)(2) and (f)(4).
      </p>

Commitment under this section shall not exceed the sentences provided for by the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, compiled in title 40, chapter 35, and in no event shall a juvenile offender be sentenced to Range II or Range III.”

        The standard of proof in a proceeding in juvenile court to revoke home placement is by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. State ex rel. Gillard v. Cook, 528 S.W.2d 545, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 627 (Tenn. 1975).

       </h4>
       <p>
        The juvenile judge must consider each case on its merits to determine whether the appointment of counsel is required at a home placement revocation hearing using such criteria as whether the juvenile can speak capably for himself, or whether he alleges in a timely and colorable claim that he has not committed the violation or that there are substantial reasons mitigating the violation which are complex or difficult to present, within any doubt being resolved in favor of appointment of counsel. State ex rel. Gillard v. Cook, 528 S.W.2d 545, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 627 (Tenn. 1975).

        In the context of a juvenile commitment, “the law of the land” provision of Tenn. Const., art.

        Criminal Court did not err in committing a juvenile to the custody of the Department of Children's Services (DCS) for an indefinite term because the juvenile's probation had been extended multiple times, he had pleaded guilty to three violations of probation, and the Court could impose any disposition that was permissible in an original proceeding, one of which was to commit him to DCS.

        The general assembly intended compensation for counsel for indigents at all stages of felony proceedings, including those before local committing magistrates such as general sessions or municipal courts; further, the right to compensation of counsel for indigents has been extended to misdemeanor cases as well as to felonies. The supreme court also has been directed to provide rules for compensation in all cases where appointment of counsel is required by law. Allen v. McWilliams, 715 S.W.2d 28, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 840 (Tenn. 1986). (See Tenn. R. Sup. Ct. 13).

In re Harris, 849 S.W.2d 334, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (Tenn. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the fee allowed the guardian ad litem for the mother and the fee allowed the guardian ad litem of the child could not be assessed against the department of human services (now children's service), unless it was found that the parents were indigent and the petition was based on grounds set forth in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-403" target="_self">37-1-403</a></cite>. In re Harris, 849 S.W.2d 334, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (Tenn. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 13 did not limit the fees that could be awarded to a guardian ad litem because there was nothing deceptive in a guardian ad litem accepting compensation as limited by the rule and later requesting that payment be made by the parents when it appears that they are financially able to do so; the compensation limits of Rule 13 do not necessarily apply when a parent has been found to be financially able to defray a portion or all of the cost of the child's representation.

       <p>
        Notice given to the mother that she could be responsible for the guardian ad litem's fees was sufficient under the statute because the mother was represented by counsel, she objected to the juvenile court's indigence finding at the hearing, and at no time did the mother contend that she was indigent or lacked the means to pay all or part of the reasonable compensation of the guardian ad litem.

        Chancery court's order modifying child support and allocating a tax exemption was void because, before the order was entered, a juvenile court assumed exclusive jurisdiction in a dependency and neglect proceeding concerning the child, depriving the chancery court of subject matter jurisdiction, as (1) no statutory exceptions to the juvenile court's exclusive jurisdiction were present, (2) child support was a component of dependency and neglect proceedings, and (3) the tax exemption was an inevitable part of the juvenile court's decisions.

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment rewrote this section which read: “(a) On application of a party, or on the court's own motion, the court may make an order restraining or otherwise controlling the conduct of a person if:“(1) An order of disposition of a delinquent, unruly or dependent or neglected child has been or is about to be made in a proceeding under this part, or if it appears that a person against whom the restraining order is sought should be prohibited from associating with or engaging in certain conduct in relation to such child either absolutely or conditionally;“(2) The court finds that the conduct:“(A) Is or may be detrimental or harmful to the child; and“(B) Will tend to defeat the execution of the order of disposition; and“(3) Due notice of the application or motion and the grounds therefor and an opportunity to be heard thereon have been given to the person against whom the order is directed.“(b) On application of a party or on the court's own motion, the court may issue an immediate ex parte temporary restraining order controlling the conduct of a person if:“(1) The court finds that a child otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the court may be removed from such jurisdiction or the court finds that there is danger of immediate harm to a child; and“(2) Due notice of the order and the grounds therefor and the opportunity to be heard thereon is given to the party against whom the order is directed within three (3) days of the issuance of such order or upon such party's application for a hearing.“(c) On application of the department or the child protection team as defined in part 6 of this chapter, the court may make a no contact order for the removal of a suspected perpetrator of child sexual abuse from the home where the child resides and from all further contact with the child, if the court finds that there is probable cause to believe that such person committed an act of child sexual abuse as defined in part 6 of this chapter. Such an order does not relieve such person from the person's legal duty to provide financial support for the person's family. The court may imprison any person violating such an order for up to one (1) year for contempt of court, or the court may fashion such other remedy as it finds appropriate for the protection of the child. If the court determines that there is an immediate threat of harm to the child, the court may issue a no contact order as provided in subsection (b); otherwise, it shall provide that due notice of the application and the grounds therefor and an opportunity to be heard thereon have been given to the person against whom the order is directed.”

        It is clear that the legislature intended T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-153ol1a" target="_self">37-1-153(a)</a></cite> to apply to all records of juvenile court proceedings, including plea hearings.

        Although the statute permits inspection by counsel, such permission is granted to a party's attorney in representative capacity only, and thus the attorney in this case failed to show or allege that she was seeking to vindicate an existing right.

        Statute did not entitle plaintiffs to the requested recordings of juvenile court proceedings; although the first subsection permitted inspection of files and records, the third subsection specified that, besides petitions and orders, any other document or record was excluded, and except under limited circumstances, the legislature intended for juvenile court files and records to be kept confidential, and this intent is consistent with the express statutory purpose of providing for the protection of children coming within the juvenile court's jurisdiction. Reguli v. Guffee, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 810 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Feb. 16, 2017).

        It was not error to dismiss parents'  petition to hold a court-appointed special advocate in contempt for allegedly disclosing juvenile court records because (1) one alleged “record” concerning potential discovery questions was not a court record, and (2) the disclosure of a guardian ad litem's motion that was technically a court record was not done with the ill intent required for criminal contempt.

        Requests for declaratory and mandamus relief were proper ways for plaintiffs to challenge the judge's refusal, under the local rule, to release the requested recordings, but for either form of relief to be appropriate, the local rule had to conflict with the statute; the judge's decision did not violate the statute and the claims were properly dismissed.

        Where pornographic photographs depicting defendant engaged in illegal sexual activity with prosecutrix were seized in violation of defendant's fourth amendment rights and improperly admitted into evidence at trial, the appellate court was unable to say that prosecutrix's testimony alone was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction, and hence the case was remanded for a new trial.

        Evidence supported defendant's convictions for assault and contributing to the delinquency of a minor because the testimony by the witnesses for the State of Tennessee established that defendant not only encouraged defendant's minor child to attack the minor victim and prevented other people from going to the victim's aid, but that defendant also struck the victim. The evidence further established that the victim was injured as a result of the attack State v. Edwards, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 434 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 6, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 589 (Tenn. Sept. 14, 2018).

        The juvenile court shall be a court of record; and any appeal from any final order or judgment in a delinquency proceeding, filed under this chapter, except a proceeding pursuant to § 37-1-134, may be made to the criminal court or court having criminal jurisdiction that shall hear the testimony of witnesses and try the case de novo. However, if the child pleads guilty or no contest in a delinquency or unruly proceeding, the child waives the right to appeal the adjudication. If the plea includes an agreement as to disposition, the child also waives the right to appeal the disposition. Any appeal from any final order or judgment in an unruly child proceeding or dependent and neglect proceeding, filed under this chapter, may be made to the circuit court that shall hear the testimony of witnesses and try the case de novo. The appeal shall be perfected within ten (10) days, excluding nonjudicial days, following the entry of the juvenile court's order. If a hearing before a judge of a matter heard by a magistrate is not requested or provided pursuant to § 37-1-107, the date of the expiration of the time within which to request the hearing shall be the date of disposition for appeal purposes, and the parties and their attorneys shall be so notified by the magistrate. If there is a rehearing by the judge, the appeal period shall commence the day after the order of disposition is entered.

        An appeal does not suspend the order of the juvenile court, nor does it release the child from the custody of that court or of that person, institution or agency to whose care the child has been committed. Pending the hearing, the criminal court or circuit court may make the same temporary disposition of the child as is vested in juvenile courts; provided, that until the criminal court or circuit court has entered an order for temporary disposition, the order of the juvenile court shall remain in effect. A juvenile court shall retain jurisdiction to the extent needed to complete any reviews or permanency hearings for children in foster care as may be mandated by federal or state law.

When an appeal is taken from a juvenile court's decision that involves the removal of a child or children from the custody of their natural or legal parents or guardian or from the department of children's services, or when the decision appealed involves the deprivation of a child's liberty as the result of a finding that such child engaged in criminal activity, such hearing shall be held within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the findings and reports. In its order, the criminal court or circuit court shall remand the case to the juvenile court for enforcement of the judgment rendered by the criminal court or circuit court. Appeals from an order of the criminal court or circuit court pursuant to this subsection (c) may be carried to the court of appeals as provided by law.

        In a custody dispute between a father from California and the maternal grandparents from Tennessee, the orders of a Tennessee circuit court determining jurisdiction, custody, and any visitation to the father were vacated because it failed to conduct a de novo review of the dependency and neglect proceedings under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-130" target="_self">37-1-130</a></cite>.

        Circuit court erred in finding a child dependent and neglected and in awarding custody of the child jointly to the child's parent and grandparent, based on the parent's stipulation of dependency and neglect, because the record lacked clear and convincing evidence that the child was dependent and neglected as of the date of the de novo hearing by the court.

       <p>
        Grandparents were properly allowed to intervene in a dependency and neglect case because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-159ol1a" target="_self">37-1-159(a)</a></cite>, effective after an appeal was perfected, was retroactive, as the statute was procedural, since the statute created no substantive right, affected no vested right, and only said juvenile court parties were parties to a de novo appeal.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly conducted a de novo hearing on appeal from juvenile court because the court (1) heard live testimony, and admitted exhibits, and (2) properly received a transcript of juvenile court proceedings when a mother was unavailable due to asserting the right to remain silent, and the hearsay rule did not exclude the mother's former testimony. In re Brooklyn S., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 736 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court found that mother's children were dependent and neglected within the meaning of the law, but did not reach the dispositional phase of the proceeding or make any determination regarding the proper placement for the children. Consequently, the order appealed was not a final, appealable judgment, and the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In re Ravyn R., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 211 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2018).

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in considering a mother's Alford plea to child endangerment, along with other evidence, in reaching its decision that the mothers'  children were dependent and neglected at the time of the de novo hearing. Furthermore, the trial court did not rely solely on the juvenile court record (specifically the Alford plea) and did consider new evidence. In re Treylynn T., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn.

        Circuit court properly determined that a juvenile's appeal of a juvenile court's determination of delinquency should be dismissed based upon application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. The juvenile had a long history of refusing to cooperate with the juvenile court, that the juvenile fled from a rehabilitation facility in which he was placed pursuant to a court order and engaged in additional delinquent acts during that time, and his fugitive status was directly related to the pending appeal.

        Order of financial guardianship entered by the juvenile court was not void on its face and could not be attacked in a collateral proceeding, despite the order's errors and irregularities, because venue was properly established, the juvenile court was a “court of record,” and the orders corresponded with the petitions filed by a minor's half-sister requesting her appointment as guardian; an insurer was entitled to rely upon the juvenile court's facially valid order authorizing disbursement of proceeds.

        Trial court did not err by admitting the transcript of the juvenile court testimony of two witnesses in lieu of their live testimony as they were unavailable because they were allowable under Tenn. R. Evid. 804(b)(1). The trial court also considered the live testimony of eight witnesses and therefore it conducted a proper de novo hearing under T.C.A.  37-1-159.

       <p>
        Circuit court properly held that the mother lacked standing to appeal the juvenile court's dismissal of the Department of Children's Services' petition seeking to have the child found dependent and neglected due to the father's alleged sexual abuse where the reviewing court could not determine from the record whether the mother sought to align her interests directly with the Department's position, and the mother's rights were not impaired by the dismissal.

        Circuit court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to consider the award of fees to the guardian ad litem because the mother's appeal from the order requiring her to pay half of the fees was timely.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence preponderated against the juvenile's claim that the circuit court acted illegally by failing to hear his appeal on the merits within 45 days where there were insufficient facts from which determine whether the circuit court had jurisdiction or the date upon which it dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

        State's issue regarding the trial court's denial of its motion to reconsider was pretermitted as moot because pending appeal to the circuit court, the trial court's order remained in effect. State ex rel. Smith v. Thorne, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a circuit court did not perform a reviewing function in an appeal from a dependency and neglect proceeding, the circuit court's order had to be vacated and the case remanded as the circuit court was to conduct a trial de novo and hear the evidence anew and make its own findings in the case.

        Father's post-trial motion had no effect on the time for filing an appeal under subsection (a) because the father did not raise the denial of his post-trial motion in his appeal; the post-trial motion was filed more than thirty days following the entry of the trial court's final order of guardianship, well after the time for appealing expired, and past the time for filing a post-trial motion to alter or amend even if the case had been governed by the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.

The record also contained the testimony of Tennessee department of children's services'  employees and other service providers demonstrating the department's almost continual efforts over three years to assist the parents in creating a home environment that would enable the safe reunification of the family.

        Court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because the state failed to provide reasonable efforts at rehabilitation; the case manager conceded that she never attempted to communicate with the mother in writing and that she never had any follow-up conversations with the mother about helping her obtain rehabilitative services.

        Court erred in terminating a father's parental rights because the state failed to provide reasonable efforts at rehabilitation; the case manager conceded that no effort was made to communicate with the father in writing, and his third case manager admitted that she had only one face-to-face meeting with the father that occurred when he was incarcerated in the workhouse. On that occasion, the case manager admitted that she failed to provide the father with the written notice of the meeting that she had provided the mother earlier that same day and that she did not offer to make arrangements to provide him services at that time. In re Tiffany B., 228 S.W.3d 148, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 102 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2007), appeal denied, In re T. B., — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 379 (Tenn. Apr. 23, 2007), appeal denied, In re T.

       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, the state's efforts were reasonable, because it made arrangements for the mother to participate in high-risk training classes for her children and to transport the mother to those classes; in addition, the state made efforts in arranging and supervising visits between the mother and her children. In re J.C.D., 254 S.W.3d 432, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 741 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2007), appeal denied, In re J. C. D., — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (Tenn. Feb. 25, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order terminating mother's parental rights was vacated because the record failed to contain clear and convincing evidence that the department of children's services made reasonable efforts to reunite the mother with the child as required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-166ol1a2" target="_self">37-1-166(a)(2)</a></cite>, (g)(2) or that the mother abandoned the child by failure to support; none of the aggravated circumstances pertained to the mother's case and thus the department was not relieved of its affirmative duty to exert reasonable efforts to assist the mother to satisfy her goals under the permanency plans. In re R.L.F., 278 S.W.3d 305, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 445 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 2008), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 788 (Tenn. Oct. 20, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of father's parental rights based on mental incompetence was proper because: (1) Assistance needed to ensure that father's children received proper care would have to essentially be a substitute parent, with father acting only as a caring but incompetent bystander; and (2) Doctor testified clearly that father's mental retardation was a lifelong condition and that he functioned in such a low range that no amount of training, education, or counseling could bring him up to the level where he could parent the children; thus, a showing of reasonable efforts to return the children to their home was unnecessary. Department of Children's Servs. v. Mims, 285 S.W.3d 435, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 706 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2008), appeal denied, In re N.B., — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Mar. 16, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination case, the state made reasonable efforts at reunification because the mother moved around often and failed to stay in contact with the state, the state made efforts to help the mother obtain subsidized housing, and the mother's repeated stints in jail were a continuing obstacle; trial court found that the state provided job counseling to the mother during the intervals in which she was not incarcerated. State v. Estes, 284 S.W.3d 790, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 773 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2008), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. LEXIS 151 (Tenn. Mar. 16, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal from the termination of her parental rights, the appellate court determined that the Department of Children's Services had exerted reasonable efforts to reunify the mother and her child, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-166ol1c" target="_self">37-1-166(c)</a></cite>. In part, a counselor testified that she helped the mother with her employment and housing search, which included taking the mother to a drug test in order to obtain a job; the counselor also provided the mother with a list of subsidized housing and career center information and counseled the mother on how to interview and dress for an interview. In re Arteria H., 326 S.W.3d 167, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 486 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 27, 2010), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 949 (Tenn. Oct. 14, 2010).

        In an action involving the termination of the father's parental rights, the finding that the Department of Children's Services proved reasonable efforts was improper, requiring that the trial court's finding on the ground of substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-113ol1g2" target="_blank">36-1-113(g)(2)</a></cite> be reversed. Prior to the filing of the termination petition, DCS efforts to work with the father to provide assistance to him in completing his responsibilities under the 2008 permanency plans were perfunctory at best, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-166ol1g1" target="_self">37-1-166(g)(1)</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Affidavit of the Tennessee Department of Children's Services satisfied the requirements of subsection (c)(3) because it listed all of the services provided to the mother and the dates they were provided; each entry identified what the services were, and the affidavit listed the services that were provided up until two weeks before the termination hearing, not just prior to the child's removal.

        Efforts of the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (DCS) to reunify a mother with her child were reasonable the mother voluntarily engaged in conduct that led to her incarceration and thwarted DCS's efforts by providing incorrect contact information, failing to stay in contact with DCS, and failing to keep it informed; the mother testified that she knew of the responsibilities she had under the permanency plans, but she still chose to miss her meetings and not visit her child.

       <p>
        Tennessee Department of Children's Services did not violate the statute by failing to seeking a court order and to put forth enough effort throughout the entire course of the case because it made reasonable efforts throughout the case, and there was no evidence to suggest that there was any point in time prior to the termination hearing when it stopped doing so; the primary case worker tried to contact the mother and met with her in prison up until two weeks before the termination hearing.

        Clear and convincing evidence supported the finding that the Department of Children's Services (DCS) made reasonable efforts to reunite parents with their eight-month-old child because there was evidence specifically identifying the requirements of the permanency plans and DCS referrals, including potential employers, mental health services, anger management, marriage counseling, but, at the time of trial, the parents had not, with one exception completed any required classes.

       <p>
        Actions of the Tennessee Department of Children's Services to assist a mother in establishing a suitable home were reasonable because the Department submitted an affidavit of reasonable efforts by its representative, detailing the services provided during the four months after the children's removal from the home; the Department developed a permanency plan, and it provided the mother with money to pay pay overdue utility bills in order to help her obtain suitable housing.

        Termination of a mother's parental rights pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-113ol1g1" target="_blank">36-1-113(g)(1)</a></cite> was proper because the mother abandoned the child by willful failure to visit and by willful failure to support the child; the mother did not visit or make payments toward the child's support during the relevant period, although the department was prepared to assist the mother with transportation in order to visit, if mother cooperated with a drug screen requirement, but she did not and the mother received $ 1,700 a month in VA benefits for five years, but provided no financial support for the child. The department was not required to provide evidence that it made “reasonable efforts” to make it possible for the child to return home for termination based on abandonment.

       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, because the juvenile court found at a hearing that the mother committed severe abuse by exposing the youngest child to methamphetamine in utero and relieved the Department of Children's Services (DCS) of its obligation of further reasonable efforts toward reunification, and because the mother was afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard at the hearing and the adjudication of the dependency and neglect action, the mother's due process rights were not violated when the DCS discontinued funding for drug counseling services.

       </p>
       <p>
        Any issue concerning lack of reasonable efforts to reunify a family was without merit because of aggravating circumstances as the evidence presented at trial was clear and convincing that the parents engaged in severe child abuse against each of their children. In re Samuel P., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 367 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 24, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 816 (Tenn. Sept. 22, 2014).

        Because both parents were found to have committed severe child abuse, the Tennessee Department of Children's Services was relieved of making reasonable efforts toward reunification with a parent whose parental rights were terminated.

        There was substantial evidence that the Department of Children's Services (DCS) did expend reasonable efforts to achieve the goals of the permanency plan, plus DCS was ultimately relieved of making reasonable efforts as to the mother pursuant to the determination that she had subjected one of the children to severe child abuse.

        Terms of permanency plans were reasonable and related to remedying the conditions which necessitated removal of children from their parents'  home and placement of the children in foster care, as a caseworker performed therapeutic visitation on 13 occasions that focused on parenting skills, interacting with the children, cleaning and maintaining a safe home, monitoring the children, and being attentive to them.

        As termination of parents'  rights over one child was based on numerous instances of severe child abuse, which constituted “aggravating circumstances,” termination of their rights over their other child was proper without efforts towards reunification pursuant to T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-166" target="_self">37-1-166</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-102" target="_blank">36-1-102</a></cite>.

        In proceedings to terminate parental rights, the Department of Children's Services (DCS) was not required to reunite five children with their mother and father, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-166ol1g4A" target="_self">37-1-166(g)(4)(A)</a></cite>, because the parents had committed severe child abuse, which constituted “aggravating circumstances” and excused DCS from making reasonable efforts to reunite the family.

       <p>
        Parenting plan adopted by a trial court after a dispositional hearing was not deficient, even though it did not state that its primary goal was family reunification, nor did it set out a plan for a child's custody to be returned to the mother, because the Department of Children's Services (DCS) was never involved in the instant custody matter, and, as such, the trial court was under no obligation, pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-166" target="_self">37-1-166</a></cite>, to direct the grandparents, who had custody of the child, or DCS use reasonable efforts to provide the mother with services or otherwise to make it possible for the child to return to the mother's custody.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in determining that based on the severe abuse committed against the children, the appropriate disposition was to place the children in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Children's Services without allowing any visitation with the parent and without requiring the Department to expend any effort at reunification; the parents committed severe abuse against four of the children at issue in this case, and thus the trial court was authorized to order a disposition of the child that did not include an effort toward reunification.

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper based upon the persistence of conditions which led to removal because she was not able to provide a safe and sanitary home for the child; because the Tennessee Department of Children's Services took great measures to reunite the mother with the child; the mother's limited cognitive ability greatly impaired the DCS's efforts and qualified as additional conditions that prevented the child's safe return; and because the continuation of the mother's limited relationship with the child greatly diminished his integration into a safe, stable and permanent home. In re Thomas A.H., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 88 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the father's parental rights under the ground of persistent conditions was proper because the Department of Children's Services (DCS) exerted reasonable efforts under the circumstances and the conditions which led to the child's removal persisted. The father failed to keep DCS informed of his address telephone number while he was living on the streets addicted to drugs and DCS could not be expected to provide services to a parent who chose to remain unreachable. In re Aiden W., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 240 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 28, 2014), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 582 (Tenn. July 14, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's finding that the father was in substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan was supported by clear and convincing evidence where he failed to address the primary issue that prohibited his reunification with the child, namely his inability to abide by the law and he was not released from jail until after the termination petition had already been filed.

       <p>
        Trial court's finding that the mother was in substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan was supported by clear and convincing evidence where she failed to regularly remit child support and she failed to address the primary issue that prohibited her reunification with the child, namely her alleged drug abuse. The mother was uncooperative in each of the three alcohol and drug assessments, she refused to submit to several drug screens, and she failed to provide current prescription information to account for some of her positive drug screens.

         Where the juvenile judge and the county executive (now county mayor) were acting in good faith in paying and receiving the salary supplement fixed by the county legislative body, the judge should not be required to pay back the supplemental salary. In such circumstances, it is appropriate to apply the principle that the unconstitutional act was voidable until condemned by judicial pronouncement. Franks v. State, 772 S.W.2d 428, 1989 Tenn. LEXIS 261 (Tenn. 1989).

          Court of appeals improperly blamed juvenile defendant for delays in his case because defendant was able to seek post-commitment relief after the time for filing an appeal was expired; the record showed that a notice of appeal was filed more than one year before defendant's 19th birthday, his appellate brief was served within five months of the notice, the state filed several requests for extensions before filing its briefs, oral argument was postponed for more than two months, and the opinion of the court of appeals was released only 14 days after defendant had reached the age of 19.

           Physicians are immune from liability only to the extent that their conduct arises from their duty to report suspicions of child abuse, which may include diagnosing a child's medical condition, contacting authorities, and preparing and testifying as to their opinions; they are not shielded from other actions beyond the reporting requirement.

           Court rejected a mother's argument that finding a material change in circumstances based on one parent reporting the other for suspected child sexual abuse was against public policy because anyone, including a parent, was required by law to report a child's accusations of sexual abuse to the appropriate authorities; any concern about reporting allegations of child sexual abuse had to be balanced with the awareness that false accusations of such abuse can be a reprehensible tool against an ex-spouse, remarkable for its brutal effectiveness.

If the investigator deems it necessary, the investigation shall also include medical, psychological or psychiatric examinations of the child and any other children in the child's home or under the care of any person alleged to have permitted or caused abuse, neglect or sexual abuse to the child. If the investigator determines, based on a visit to the child's home, observation of and interview with the subject child, and interview with other persons in the child's home, that the report of harm was wholly without substance, the investigator may determine that physical and psychological examinations of the subject child are unnecessary, in which case they will not be required. If admission to the home, school, or any place where the child may be, or permission of the parents or persons responsible for the child's care for the physical and psychological or psychiatric examinations cannot be obtained, the juvenile court, upon cause shown, shall order the parents or person responsible for the care of the child or the person in charge of any place where the child may be, to allow entrance for the interview, examination, and investigation. If the report of harm indicates that the abuse, neglect or sexual abuse occurred in a place other than the child's home, then, in the discretion of the investigator, the investigation may include a visit to the location where the incident occurred or a personal interview with the child and the parents or other custodians in another location instead of a visit to the child's home.

If the nature of the child's injuries indicate a need for immediate medical examination or treatment, the investigator may take or cause the child to be taken for diagnosis to a licensed physician or an emergency department in a hospital without the consent of the child's parents, legal guardian or legal custodian. Any licensed physician who, based on information furnished by the investigator, the parents or other persons having knowledge of the situation, or the child, or on personal observation of the child, suspects that an injury was the result of child abuse, may authorize appropriate examinations to be performed on the child without the consent of the child's parent, legal guardian or legal custodian.

           No later than sixty (60) days after receiving the initial report, the department or team in cases of child sexual abuse or the department in all other cases shall determine whether the reported abuse was indicated or unfounded and report its findings to the department's abuse registry. Each member of the team shall be provided with a copy of the report in any case investigated by the team. In any case investigated solely by the department, the department shall make a complete written investigation report, including its recommendation, to the juvenile court. The district attorney general shall also be provided a copy of any report in all cases where the investigation determines that the report was indicated. Further proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to part 1 of this chapter, as appropriate.

Such services may include provision for protective shelter, to include room and board; medical and remedial care; day care; homemaker; caretaker; transportation; counseling and therapy; training courses for the parents or legal guardian; and arranging for the provision of other appropriate services. All such services shall be provided when appropriate within the limits of available resources. These services shall first be offered for the voluntary acceptance by the parent or other person responsible for the care of the child, unless immediate removal is needed to protect the child. At any point if the department or team in cases of child sexual abuse or the department in all other cases deems that the child's need for protection so requires, it may proceed with appropriate action under part 1 of this chapter.

Any interested person who has information regarding the offenses may forward a statement to the district attorney general as to whether such person believes prosecution is justified and appropriate. Within fifteen (15) days of the completion of the district attorney general's investigation of a report of severe abuse, the district attorney general shall advise the department or team whether or not prosecution is justified and appropriate, in the district attorney general's opinion, in view of the circumstances of the specific case.

             Trial court properly denied motion to exclude clergymen's testimony about defendant's confessions of sex with child victim; the privileged communication doctrine that applied to clergymen did not apply pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-602ol1a3D" target="_self">37-1-602(a)(3)(D)</a></cite> because defendant resided in the victim's home, was responsible for the child's care and custody, and was acting as the victim's parent. State v. Workman, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 909 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 13, 2011), review denied and ordered not published, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 569 (Tenn. Aug. 16, 2012).

             If the order outlining the conditions that led to the removal of the child is pending appeal, that order is not res judicata, and until that order has reached its final completion, the prior order cannot form the basis alone for termination on any ground that contemplates reliance on a previous finding or order; because the current posture of the father's appeal from the order on dependency and neglect, where the juvenile court found the child was a victim of sexual abuse, could be determined, the trial court erred in terminating his rights on the ground of persistence of conditions. In re S.S.-G., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 917 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
             Trial court stated only that the father had sexually abused the child, which constituted severe abuse, but the trial court's failure to include the specific statutory definitions that it relied upon prevented meaningful review; where the statute provides several possible definitions for a ground, the trial court must specify the exact definition that it relies upon in reaching its ultimate conclusion, and the termination of the father's rights on the ground of severe child abuse was vacated. In re S.S.-G., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 917 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2015).

             Court rejected a mother's argument that finding a material change in circumstances based on one parent reporting the other for suspected child sexual abuse was against public policy because anyone, including a parent, was required by law to report a child's accusations of sexual abuse to the appropriate authorities; any concern about reporting allegations of child sexual abuse had to be balanced with the awareness that false accusations of such abuse can be a reprehensible tool against an ex-spouse, remarkable for its brutal effectiveness.

             Offense of failing to report suspected child sexual abuse requires that a person have reasonable cause to suspect child sexual abuse, which may justify a person's own investigation prior to deciding whether to report; just as a decision not to report can harm a child, a decision to report can have devastating effects on the falsely-accused.

             Trial court erred by denying judicial diversion for the offense of failing to report suspected child sexual abuse; defendant had reported abuse previously, she had cared for all three of the children in the children's group home, she investigated the incident and honestly believed one child did not sexually abuse the others, and nothing indicated that she failed to report the allegations in order to protect the one child or the home.

The juvenile court may establish a permanent guardianship at a permanency planning hearing or at any other hearing in which a permanent legal disposition of the child can be made, including a child protection proceeding or a delinquency proceeding.

          Amendments. The 2020 amendment rewrote the definition of “abandonment” which read: “‘Abandonment’ means, for purposes of terminating the parental or guardian rights of a parent or parents or a guardian or guardians of a child to that child in order to make that child available for adoption, that: “(i) For a period of four (4) consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of a proceeding or pleading to terminate the parental rights of the parent or parents or a guardian or guardians of the child who is the subject of the petition for termination of parental rights or adoption, that the parent or parents or a guardian or guardians either have willfully failed to visit or have willfully failed to support or make reasonable payments toward the support of the child;“(ii) The child has been removed from the home of the parent or parents or a guardian or guardians as the result of a petition filed in the juvenile court in which the child was found to be a dependent and neglected child, as defined in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c01s37-1-102" target="_self">37-1-102</a></cite>, and the child was placed in the custody of the department or a licensed child-placing agency, that the juvenile court found, or the court where the termination of parental rights petition is filed found, that the department or a licensed child-placing agency made reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the child or that the circumstances of the child's situation prevented reasonable efforts from being made prior to the child's removal; and for a period of four (4) months following the removal, the department or agency has made reasonable efforts to assist the parent or parents or a guardian or guardians to establish a suitable home for the child, but that the parent or parents or a guardian or guardians have made no reasonable efforts to provide a suitable home and have demonstrated a lack of concern for the child to such a degree that it appears unlikely that they will be able to provide a suitable home for the child at an early date. The efforts of the department or agency to assist a parent or guardian in establishing a suitable home for the child may be found to be reasonable if such efforts exceed the efforts of the parent or guardian toward the same goal, when the parent or guardian is aware that the child is in the custody of the department;“(iii) A biological or legal father has either willfully failed to visit or willfully failed to make reasonable payments toward the support of the child's mother during the four (4) months immediately preceding the birth of the child; provided, that in no instance shall a final order terminating the parental rights of a parent as determined pursuant to this subdivision (1)(A)(iii) be entered until at least thirty (30) days have elapsed since the date of the child's birth;“(iv) A parent or guardian is incarcerated at the time of the institution of an action or proceeding to declare a child to be an abandoned child, or the parent or guardian has been incarcerated during all or part of the four (4) months immediately preceding the institution of such action or proceeding, and either has willfully failed to visit or has willfully failed to support or make reasonable payments toward the support of the child for four (4) consecutive months immediately preceding such parent's or guardian's incarceration, or the parent or guardian has engaged in conduct prior to incarceration that exhibits a wanton disregard for the welfare of the child; or“(v) The child, as a newborn infant aged seventy-two (72) hours or less, was voluntarily left at a facility by such infant's mother pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.68.html#t68c11s68-11-255" target="_blank">68-11-255</a></cite>, and, for a period of thirty (30) days after the date of voluntary delivery, the mother failed to visit or seek contact with the infant; and, for a period of thirty (30) days after notice was given under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c01s36-1-142ol1e" target="_blank">36-1-142(e)</a></cite>, and no less than ninety (90) days cumulatively, the mother failed to seek contact with the infant through the department or to revoke her voluntary delivery of the infant;”.

           In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the mother failed to comply with her responsibilities under the permanency plan requiring her to complete an alcohol and drug assessment, maintain appropriate, drug-free housing, participate in a parenting assessment and attend parenting classes, and maintain financial stability by cooperating with public assistance programs and acquiring and maintaining employment for a minimum of six months.

           It was error to terminate a mother's parental rights due to substantial noncompliance with a permanency plan because the record did not contain a document that met the definition of a permanency plan, as an order containing conditions the mother had to satisfy for the children to be returned did not meet this definition, nor did the record otherwise contain a document meeting this requirement.

           In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court found that the mother failed to comply with her responsibilities under the permanency plan where the mother failed to provide pay stubs to verify her claim that she was employed, stopped attending therapeutic visits, continued to use drugs, and lived in a motel room paid for with the proceeds from drug sales.

           The department of human services' (now children's services) failure to comply with this section did not preclude a finding, under the parental rights termination statute, that the department made reasonable efforts to rehabilitate the family unit.

           In an action involving the termination of a mother's parental rights, though the juvenile court failed to timely ratify the permanency plans developed by the department of children's services for the mother, the permanency plans were not nullities, because the mother never argued that she was unaware of the conditions placed on her or that she thought that the plans had lapsed.

           Termination of the father's parental rights to his son under the ground of substantial non-compliance with a permanency plan was improper because he was never informed of the contents of the permanency plans and he could not have complied with requirements of which he was unaware.

           Trial court failed to ratify the plan within sixty days because it ratified the plan ten months after the child entered Department of Children's Services (DCS) custody; DCS and trial courts have a statutory duty to prepare and ratify permanency plans in a timely fashion, but failure to follow the prescribed time line is not grounds for nullifying the permanency plan because the requirements are directory and not mandatory.

           In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court found that the mother failed to comply with her responsibilities under the permanency plan requiring her to complete an alcohol and drug assessment; maintain appropriate, drug-free housing; participate in a parenting assessment and attend parenting classes; and maintain financial stability by cooperating with public assistance programs and acquiring and maintaining employment for a minimum of six months. The mother failed to provide pay stubs to verify her claim that she was employed; stopped attending therapeutic visits; continued to use drugs; and lived in a motel room paid for with the proceeds from drug sales.

           Where children were at risk due to illegal drug use and domestic abuse in the home, permanency plan which required father to undergo alcohol, drug, and parenting assessments, as well as random drug screens, was reasonable under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403ol1a2C" target="_self">37-2-403(a)(2)(C)</a></cite> because the terms were designed to remedy these problems; trial court did not err by terminating father's parental rights on the ground of noncompliance with the permanency plan. In re L.M.W., 275 S.W.3d 843, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 512 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 3, 2008), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 768 (Tenn. Oct. 6, 2008).

While the father attempted to comply with some of the requirements in the permanency plan, the finding that the father's was in substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan was supported by clear and convincing evidence.

           It was inappropriate to terminate parental rights based on the ground of substantial noncompliance with a family services plan where the Department of Children's Services (DCS) did not take the child into State protective custody, did not obtain court approval of any permanency plan, did not include in the permanency plan notification to the child's parent of the criteria for termination and the consequences of failing to comply with the DCS plan, and did not undertake to provide reasonable efforts to assist the parent.

           Parent was in substantial noncompliance with a permanency plan as the parent tested positive for banned substances eight times after the parent's child came into Tennessee Department of Children's Services custody and the parent made herself unavailable for testing for weeks at a time, thereby avoiding the possible discovery of additional drug abuse.

           Trial court made the necessary findings in regard to the first permanency plan because it stated that the requirements in the permanency plans were all reasonably related to remedying the conditions that necessitated foster care; the trial court made its finding in conjunction with its conclusion that the mother had not substantially complied with the provisions of the permanency plans and, therefore, her parental rights would be terminated In re J.C.B., — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn.

           Clear and convincing evidence showed a father's substantial noncompliance with permanency plans because the plans'  reasonable requirements related to the reasons for the child's removal from the father's custody, who did not follow recommendations from a parenting assessment and inconsistently visited the child and participated in required treatment.

           In a termination of parental rights case, the Tennessee Department of Children's Services proved that the mother had not substantial complied with the permanency plan, even though the requirements of the permanency plan were reasonable and related to remedying the conditions that caused the child to be removed from her mother's custody, because the mother failed to obtain and maintain suitable housing, to seek employment, and to be able to provide a safe drug free environment for their children.

          <p>
           Juvenile court properly found that a mother and father failed to comply with the reasonable responsibilities contained in the permanency plan because they did not obtain suitable housing or manage to consistently pass drug screens; the requirements of the permanency plan were reasonably related to reducing the risk of harm to the children so that the children could be safely returned to the parents'  care.

          </p>
          <p>
           Terminating a father's parental rights for substantial permanency plan noncompliance did not err because (1) reunification efforts were not required, (2) the father did not comply with the plan's reasonable requirements to submit a transportation plan or prove legal, verifiable, income, and (3) the father did not otherwise comply with the plan. In re Jose L., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 814 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2016).

          <p>
           Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's finding that parents did not substantially comply with the permanency plan because the parents never maintained suitable housing or maintained consistent visitation; both parents had unresolved criminal charges, they never completed parenting classes after being terminated for nonattendance, and they also failed to follow the recommendations of their mental health and alcohol and drug assessments.

           Termination of the father's parental rights was proper based on substantial noncompliance with the permanency plans because the requirements of the plans were reasonably related to the conditions that necessitated removal of the children as the children were removed from the home due to the mother and the father's drug use, drug paraphernalia present in the home, and environmental neglect; the father did not provide or maintain suitable housing for children or refrain from illegal activity as evidenced from his incarceration at the time of the trial; and, despite the drug use that led to the children's removal, the father failed to participate in an A&D assessment, and failed to successfully complete a substance abuse program.

           Clear and convincing evidence supported termination on the ground of substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan requirements because the mother admitted that other than completing a drug-treatment program and obtaining a mental health evaluation, she made no effort to comply with her permanency plan responsibilities; the evidence was clear and convincing that the requirements of the permanency plan was reasonable and related to remedying the conditions that necessitated foster care.

          <p>
           Termination of the father's parental rights was proper based on abandonment by an incarcerated parent by wanton disregard, abandonment by failure to provide a suitable home, and substantial noncompliance with the reasonable requirements of the permanency plan because the father raped the mother while the children were present in the home, he threatened the mother and the children with physical harm, and the children were aware of his behaviors; it did not appear that the father could provide the children with a safe home, free of domestic violence, and sexually deviant behavior; and the requirement that he address the psychological and emotional abuse issues was of paramount importance, but he did nothing toward that goal.

           There was clear and convincing evidence to support terminating the parental rights of both parents on the ground of substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan because the plan was reasonable and related to the substance abuse and legal issues that necessitated foster care. The mother did not continue the mother's outpatient therapy, while the father repeatedly violated the father's probation requirements, and neither parent made any progress in demonstrating appropriate parenting despite instruction or paid any child support.

          <p>
           Clear and convincing evidence supported terminating parents'  parental rights due to substantial noncompliance with a permanency plan because (1) the permanency plan's requirements were reasonably related to the reasons for the parents'  children's removal, (2) other than the mother signing releases for providers and having money for child support deducted from her monthly Social Security benefits, the parents did nothing to comply with the plan, and, (3) after directing the Department of Children's Services (DCS) to only communicate with the parents through counsel, the parents did not maintain contact with counsel, preventing DCS from making reasonable efforts to assist the parents.

           Trial court properly determined that clear and convincing evidence supported termination of the mother's parental rights on the ground of substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan because the mother continued to test positive for illegal drugs throughout the pendency of the case; the mother's visitation with the child became progressively sporadic in the months leading to the filing of the termination petition, and the mother failed to pay any child support.

          <p>
           Termination of the father's parental rights was proper, in part because the failure to place the child with a relative was not a basis to defeat termination. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403" target="_self">37-2-403</a></cite> only required the Department of Children's Services to consider relatives when it was in the child's best interest.

          </p>
          <p>
           Although a mother claimed she was not provided proper notice that her willful failure to pay child support could result in the termination of her parental rights, the mother was given notice in the order granting permanent guardianship of the children to the grandparents; the Department of Children's Services was relieved from the case once permanent guardianship was granted. In re Dylan H., — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 670 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2011).
          </p>
          <p>
           Department of Children Services did not err in not placing a mother's child with the child's maternal grandmother instead of terminating the mother's parental rights as the grandmother was not a suitable placement in light of the deplorable conditions found in her home when the child was initially removed and her failure to take steps to protect the child, who was in her custody, when she became ill. The preference in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403" target="_self">37-2-403</a></cite> for relative placement applied only during the period immediately following removal from the home, and once that period had ended the agency was no longer required to give preference to a relative placement.

           Tennessee Department of Children's Services complied with the notice requirements of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403" target="_self">37-2-403</a></cite> in a termination of parental rights matter, as neither the mother nor the father articulated any objection or reservation to proceeding with the hearing on termination of their parental rights based on lack of compliance with § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403" target="_self">37-2-403</a></cite>, and the parents were present at a meeting where the permanency plan was developed.

          </p>
          <p>
           Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because he was not incarcerated or incapacitated, but he did not ever visit the children after they entered foster care; he failed to substantially comply with the permanency plan, despite reasonable efforts by the Tennessee Department of Children's Services; the conditions which led to the necessity for foster care persisted; and termination was in the best interest of the children as the father had shown little or no interest in the welfare of the children and had provided no support for the benefit of the children, the children were placed together and were known to have a strong bond with their resource family, and the children's foster parents wished to adopt them.

          </p>
          <p>
           Permanency plans were not lengthy or hard to follow, but the father's attempts to comply were sporadic at best; he failed to provide current proof that his home was safe for the children, and the finding that he was in substantial noncompliance with the permanency plans was supported by clear and convincing evidence, such that a statutory ground existed for termination of the father's parental rights. In re Agustine R., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 17, 2015).
          </p>
          <p>
           Trial court found that the requirements under the mother's permanency plan were reasonable and related to remedying the underlying conditions that necessitated the need for the child's foster care, and the evidence showed that the mother understood the plan requirements and the consequences for failure to comply, yet she was not able to acquire and exhibit the skills to take care of the child; thus, the mother was in substantial non-compliance with plan requirements and the termination of her rights was affirmed. In re Eve C., — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 279 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2015).
          </p>
          <p>
           Ground of abandonment by failing to comply with the permanency plan was not met by clear and convincing evidence where the father attended a parenting class while in Nebraska and provided proof of completion, he testified that he had taken part in several mental health and drug assessments, he obtained a job in prison and had endeavored to pay child support, and although he admitted to being arrested after the creation of the plan he testified that those charges were not pursued.

          </p>
          <p>
           Tennessee Department of Children's Services and the trial court provided the father with adequate notice under this section where it was undisputed that he participated in the development of the first permanency plan attached to which was a “Criteria & Procedures for Termination of Parental Rights” form that he signed, and at no time did the father object based on alleged lack of compliance with the notice requirement.

          </p>
          <p>
           Tasks as outlined in the permanency plans were exceptionally difficult to be discerned, and due to the department's failure to limit the parent's responsibilities to concrete obligations that at least had the possibility of being accomplished by them, the order finding sufficient proof for termination for substantial noncompliance with a permanency plan was vacated.

           Many of the permanency plan requirements reasonable and related to remedying the conditions that led to the mother's children's removal, including requiring compliance with and passing of random drug screen, refraining from criminal activity, and maintaining appropriate housing; although the mother was credited for her efforts while incarcerated, there was clear evidence that she failed to comply with the reasonable responsibilities contained in the permanency plan, including refraining from criminal activity, obtaining housing an exhibiting appropriate parenting skills.

          <p>
           Although the trial court found grounds to terminate the mother's parental rights based on abandonment and substantial non-compliance with a permanency plan, termination of the mother's parental rights to her 17-year-old child was improper as the Tennessee Department of Children's Services failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it was in the child's best interest to terminate her mother's parental rights because the child was 17 years old, was not a candidate for adoption, and intended to maintain a relationship with the mother when she turned 18; and termination of the mother's parental rights would accomplish nothing other than setting the child adrift with no adoptive family. In re Kendra P., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 544 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 28, 2016).
          </p>
          <p>
           Evidence supported the finding of substantial noncompliance with the mother's permanency plan, making termination proper; the plan requirements were reasonable and appropriate, as the children were placed in foster care due to the mother's lack of suitable housing and substance abuse, and given the degree of noncompliance and the weight assigned to the requirements, the mother's noncompliance was substantial, as a majority of the requirements she failed to complete were aimed at addressing her substance abuse issues.

          </p>
          <p>
           Evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's termination of the father's parental rights based on substantial non-compliance with permanency plans because it showed that he failed to follow the recommendations from the assessments, failed to establish a suitable home, and was incarcerated at the time of trial.

           Father admitted that he was told that his rights could be terminated if he did not visit in four months, and thus he received sufficient notice under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403" target="_self">37-2-403</a></cite>.

           Mother failed to substantially comply with the permanency plan, which supported termination; the responsibilities established in the permanency plan were reasonable and related to the conditions that led to the removal of the children, yet the mother moved from unsuitable home to unsuitable home, never attained safe housing for the children, and she continued to have employment struggles.

          </p>
          <p>
           Father was afforded sufficient notice of the statutory definition and consequences of abandonment because he was presented with a copy of the criteria, given ample time to read the contents of the form, and provided an explanation of the form, it was undisputed that he never followed up with the case manager or informed her he did not understand the document, and he signed the form but did not inform the Tennessee Department of Children's Services or the trial court that he did not understand the document until after the termination petition was filed.

           Purpose of requiring the criteria and procedures for termination of parental rights to be included with permanency plans is to make sure the parent or guardian is aware of the grounds and procedures for terminating parental or guardianship rights and of what he must do to avoid having his rights terminated; this purpose was achieved in this case when the trial court explained the contents of the document to the father as well as when he signed statements affirming that he had received a copy and an explanation of the document.

           There was clear and convincing evidence to establish that the father failed to substantially comply with the requirements of the permanency plan; he admittedly failed to comply with most of the plan's requirements, and while the department did attempt to assist him, the father failed to avail himself of the proffered assistance.

           Father failed to substantially comply with the requirements of the permanency plan; although he completed several assessments and participated in sessions, he simply failed to address the most important aspects of the plan that would have resulted in his ability to care for the child, namely to resolve his legal issues and adequately address his drug abuse.

She never completed a second assessment, withdrew from the drug treatment program, and remained homeless. In re Josiah T., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 482 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2019).

           Since a mother failed to raise either at trial or prior to her appeal her argument that the notice requirements of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-403" target="_self">37-2-403</a></cite> had not been followed, she could not raise the issue on appeal. Moreover, these notice provisions only came into play when a parent's termination was based on abandonment, and the court affirmed the trial court's termination of the mother's parental rights on a ground other than abandonment.

          </p>
          <p>
           Termination of the father's parental rights to his son under the ground of abandonment was improper because the Department of Children's Services (DCS) failed to prove that the statutory notice requirements were met regarding its efforts to notify the father. The DCS was required to file an affidavit describing its “diligent efforts” to provide the father with the statutory notice prior to the filing of its termination petition and the record contained no such affidavit.

         <p>
          Article II, § 24 of the Constitution of Tennessee provides, in part, that: “Any law requiring the expenditure of state funds shall be null and void unless, during the session in which the act receives final passage, an appropriation is made for the estimated first year's funding.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The Tennessee code commission has been advised by the commissioner of finance and administration that the necessary first year's funding was not appropriated during the 1991 regular session for the public act that would have amended this section.
         </p>
         <p>
          The code commission was directed by Acts 1991, ch. 509, § 54 to not codify acts that did not receive first year's funding. Accordingly, Acts 1991, ch. 246, § 3, which would have amended this section, has not been codified. If ch. 246, § 3 had been codified, the amendment of (b) by that act would have read as follows: “(b) The Tennessee commission on children and youth shall develop and provide such training to juvenile court judges, youth services officers, review board members, and departmental staff as may be necessary to provide such persons with adequate knowledge to perform their duties under this part.”

For all children, absent or present, evidence shall be presented as to the child's progress and needed services. The only exceptions to the child's mandatory attendance shall be a child who is under a doctor's care preventing the child from attending, is placed outside the state or is on documented runaway status. In such event, the court shall require the guardian ad litem, case manager for the department or other case manager of the child to attest that the child participated in the development of the permanency plan or has been counseled on the provisions of the permanency plan, if age appropriate. In the child's absence, evidence shall be presented as to the child's progress and needed services.

       Code Commission Notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article II, § 24 of the Constitution of Tennessee provides, in part, that: “Any law requiring the expenditure of state funds shall be null and void unless, during the session in which the act receives final passage, and appropriation is made for the estimated first year's funding.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tennessee code commission has been advised by the commissioner of finance and administration that the necessary first year's funding was not appropriated during the 1991 regular session for the public act that would have amended this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The code commission was directed by Acts 1991, ch. 509, § 54 to not codify acts that did not receive first year's funding. Accordingly, Acts 1991, ch. 246, § 2, which would have amended this section, has not been codified. If chapter 246, § 2 had been codified, the amendment to this section by that act would have added a new subdivision in (a)(1), which would have read as follows: “Develop and implement a statewide program of training and other technical support to periodically assist advisory review boards on foster care, created pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c02s37-2-406" target="_self">37-2-406</a></cite>, in the efficient and effective performance of duties and responsibilities assigned to such boards.”

       The governor is hereby authorized and directed to execute a contract on behalf of this state with any state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       THE INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES
      </p>
      <p>
       Article I. Purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, codified in <cite class="us_code">4 U.S.C. § 112</cite> (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;
      </p>
      <p>
       Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;
      </p>
      <p>
       Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;
      </p>
      <p>
       Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;
      </p>
      <p>
       Ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;
      </p>
      <p>
       Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, compiled in part 2 of this chapter, the Interstate Compact for Supervision of Adult Offenders, compiled in title 40, chapter 28, part 4, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

       A.  The compacting states hereby create the Interstate Commission for Juveniles. The commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the compacting states. The commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.

      </p>
      <p>
       C.  In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the interstate commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners, but who are members of interested organizations.

       J.  For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the interstate commission's legal counsel shall publicly certify that, in the legal counsel's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The interstate commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       K.  The interstate commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of juveniles as directed through its rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements. Such methods of data collection, exchange and reporting shall insofar as is reasonably possible conform to up-to-date technology and coordinate its information functions with the appropriate repository of records.

      </p>
      <p>
       Section C.  Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification.
      </p>

       Article VI. Rulemaking Functions of the Interstate Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.  The interstate commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.  Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the Model State Administrative Procedures Act, 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the interstate commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the United States supreme court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.  When promulgating a rule, the interstate commission shall, at a minimum:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  Publish the proposed rule's entire text stating the reason(s) for that proposed rule;
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  Allow and invite any and all persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be added to the record, and be made publicly available;
      </p>
      <p>
       3.  Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing if petitioned by ten (10) or more persons; and
      </p>
      <p>
       4.  Promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on input from state or local officials, or interested parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.  Allow, not later than sixty (60) days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person to file a petition in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court where the interstate commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the interstate commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.  If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       F.  The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superseded by this act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the interstate commission created hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       G.  Upon determination by the interstate commission that a state of emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption; provided, that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the emergency rule.

      <p>
       1.  The interstate commission shall oversee the administration and operations of the interstate movement of juveniles subject to this compact in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in non-compacting states which may significantly affect compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions, and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission, it shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section B.  Dispute Resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  The compacting states shall report to the interstate commission on all issues and activities necessary for the administration of the compact as well as issues and activities pertaining to compliance with the provisions of the compact and its bylaws and rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a compacting state, to resolve any disputes or other issues which are subject to the compact and which may arise among compacting states and between compacting and non-compacting states. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.  The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact using any or all means set forth in Article XI of this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VIII. Finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.  The interstate commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.  The interstate commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.  The interstate commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.  The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IX. The State Council.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each member state shall create a state council for interstate juvenile supervision. While each state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims groups, and the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator or designee. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each state council will advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state's participation in interstate commission activities and other duties as may be determined by that state, including, but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article X. Compacting States, Effective Date and Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.  Any state, the District of Columbia (or its designee), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas Islands as defined in Article II of this compact is eligible to become a compacting state.

The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-member states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.  The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states.

      </p>
      <p>
       Article XI. Withdrawal, Default, Termination and Judicial Enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section A.  Withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.  The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chair of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.  The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.  Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section B.  Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
      </p>
      <p>
       a.  Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;
      </p>
      <p>
       b.  Alternative dispute resolution;
      </p>
      <p>
       c.  Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission; and
      </p>
      <p>
       d.  Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the interstate commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or the chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.  The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.  The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.  Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section C.  Judicial Enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section D.  Dissolution of Compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XII. Severability and Construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.  The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XIII. Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section A.  Other Laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section B.  Binding Effect of the Compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.  All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.  All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       4.  In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law.

         Trial court did not err in finding that the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) was applicable and in declining to rule on the custody petition until the second ICPC study was completed where it simply sought assistance pursuant to the ICPC to obtain the necessary information to render an informed decision on the custody petition.

         Trial court erred in concluding that a great uncle's home in California was a suitable placement for a child adjudicated dependent and neglected because the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children applied, no exemptions to the Compact applied, California withdrew approval for the child's placement in the great uncle's home, the child's blood ties to a potential placement family did not override all other possible dangers to the child's welfare, and even if the Compact did not apply, the trial court erred in concluding that the home was a suitable placement for the child.

The department is created to provide services to those children who are unruly, delinquent, dependent and neglected, and their respective families, as well as for children who are at imminent risk and in need of services to prevent entry into state custody, who are in state custody pending family reunification or other permanent placement, or as otherwise may be required for such children and their families pursuant to state law. In all cases, the services shall be to further the best interest of the child, and when appropriate, to preserve the relationship between the child and the family. Whenever possible, the services shall be provided in the community where the child lives and in a setting that is the least restrictive and, yet, the most beneficial to the child.

            Weight of the evidence in the record showed that both the mother and the father spent significant amounts of time with the child and that both parents, not just the mother, should equally be considered the primary caregiver for the child, given that the undisputed evidence showed that the father was very involved in the child's life and spent a substantial amount of time with the child, both in extracurricular activities and attending to his basic needs.

            Substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan was available as a ground for termination of the parents'  rights because the evidence and testimony showed that the foster parents were providing the children with child care, and coupled with the substantial involvement of the Tennessee Department of Children Services (DCS), as the children were very young and the foster parents had provided a home for them and for them to attend daycare and a headstart program. The care in which the children were placed qualified as foster care with the DCS or in the care of an agency. In re Kah'Nyia J., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 238 (Tenn. Ct.

             The purposes of this part are to safeguard and enhance the welfare of children and to preserve family life, by preventing harm and sexual abuse to children and by strengthening the ability of families to parent their children effectively through a multi-level response system using available community-based public and private services. It is intended that the department perform its function under this part pursuant to the belief that families can change the circumstances associated with the level of risk to a child, when they are provided with intensive and comprehensive services tailored to their strengths and needs. The department's fundamental assumptions shall be that most children are better off with their own families than in substitute care, and that separation has detrimental effects on both parents and children. Whenever possible, preservation of the family should serve as the framework for services, but, in any case, the best interests of the child shall be paramount.

A specific objective of the demonstration program is to reduce the incidence of children who are subjected to maltreatment. Until the program is in effect statewide, this part shall be in effect only in the areas in which the demonstration program is established.

            In each county in which the multi-level response system is implemented, the department shall facilitate the formation of an independent local advisory board, which shall not be a part of the department, and which shall be composed of appropriate community representatives, including representatives from families in the community, local public agencies, including schools, health departments and other health care providers, juvenile court, and law enforcement officials, and other available community-based resources. Each local advisory board shall recommend ways to bring together the department, families, and available resource providers within that community and shall assist with the development of community-based resources that may be needed by families. The local advisory board may review individual cases, in its discretion, to the extent that such review may be done without jeopardizing the confidentiality of the records or the confidentiality obligations of those who provided the information. The department shall collaborate with the local advisory board and the community to identify or develop local formal and informal services for children and families.

                The judicial bypass procedure's twenty-four hour period for filing a notice of appeal does not place an undue burden upon a minor's ability to obtain a judicial bypass since: (1) A minor may file or arrange for her attorney's filing of a notice of appeal before or at the conclusion of the hearing on her petition; (2) The window of time within which the minor must remain in contact with the court is only forty-eight hours; (3) The minor has and must be notified that she has the right to appointed counsel; and (4) The appeal provision expedites the judicial bypass process and thereby serves the significant state interest in protecting the health of the minor.

                 In an effort to inform the citizens of Tennessee of a free resource for families and reduce instances of child abuse, the following measures shall be performed. All public transportation buses within the state of Tennessee are urged to promote the existence of a parental help line organized by the nonprofit organization Prevent Child Abuse Tennessee and the telephone numbers for such organization, 1-800-356-6767 and 1-800-CHILDREN, as space allows in interior advertising. The department of education shall require all local education agencies to distribute information on the help line, including the telephone number, to students and the students' parents. The department of human services shall also require any licensed child care facility to distribute information on the help line, including the telephone number, to children who attend the facility and the children's parents. This section shall assist children, parents, teachers and child care workers in providing the information and support necessary for the positive development of children through a currently existing, and free to the public, resource.

      The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the commission of violent crimes by juveniles exacts an unacceptable toll on the fiscal resources of both state and local governments and thereby increases the financial burden upon the taxpayers of this state. It is the intent of the general assembly in enacting this chapter to require, as much as possible, that juveniles convicted as adults of violent crimes pay for the cost of the rehabilitation, education, and treatment of juveniles sentenced to the youthful offender system or committed to the department of correction.
