        Election of judges to the Tennessee Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee on a statewide basis is consistent with the requirements of the Tennessee Constitution, because the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals are both single, unified courts, the judges of those courts are not assigned to any district or circuit or grand division, and the judges of those courts serve the entire state.

        As the private act creating the court of general sessions for Cocke County conferred jurisdiction concurrent to a limited degree with circuit and criminal courts, but no more than the jurisdiction generally imposed in courts of general sessions, this section, requiring judges to be attorneys, did not apply to the general sessions court of Cocke County.

         The power to grant injunctions, attachments and other extraordinary process is intrusted to all our chancellors and circuit and special judges, interchangeably. In re Chadwell, 54 Tenn. 630, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1872); Flippin v. Knaffle, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 238 (1875); Thompson v. Menefee, 6 Tenn. App. 118, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Ct.

         The power to grant injunction is entrusted by statute to all chancellors, circuit and special judges and there is no statutory provision controlling the exercise of the discretionary power, but the discretion is a legal discretion and controlled by well settled rules, and the exercise of this discretion is not subject to appellate review, except in cases of manifest abuse of the discretion.

         This section has been construed not to authorize any other judge or chancellor to usurp the jurisdiction of the chancery court in which the suit is pending so as to interfere with its judgments and decrees, but at the same time it is held that the issuance of “extraordinary” process made returnable to that court is not such interference.

         One chancellor cannot enjoin the decrees of another chancellor, with a view of having them revised, reviewed, or reversed in a different chancery court from that in which they were rendered; but it is competent for any chancellor to enjoin an execution from another chancery court, upon the ground that the judgment has been paid, or otherwise satisfied, or was obtained through fraud, or upon the ground that the judgment debtor is entitled to an equitable setoff.

         There is an implied contract on the part of him who obtains the appointment of a receiver to compensate such receiver. But a nonconsenting defendant is not so liable. Where on appeal there was no remand, decree of affirmance in appellate court is not res judicata as to right to compensation, and independent suit lies against complainant in first suit, and sureties on bonds, the liability of sureties on attachment bond being limited to amount of its penalty.

          Where, on appeal, the technical record of the trial court reflected that the jury returned the verdict of guilty and that a judgment approving such verdict and sentence was in the record and the record further showed that defendant timely filed his motion for new trial and that the motion for new trial was heard and overruled on February 26, 1965, but such record was not signed by the judge trying the case and such judge died on March 29, 1965, the case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.

         <p>
          In a death penalty case, the court properly denied defendant's motion for new trial because the successor judge properly concluded he was able to fulfill his duties as thirteenth juror; he found the weight of the trial evidence supported the verdicts, and the credibility of witnesses was not an overriding issue.

          Original trial judge denied defendant's original motion for new trial in 1992, nearly 20 years before his death, such that the only motion for new trial that was filed during the effective date of the prior statute was not undisposed of at the time of the original judge's death. State v. Hall, 461 S.W.3d 469, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 241 (Tenn. Mar. 20, 2015), cert. denied, Hall v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">193 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 349, <cite class="s_court">136 S.

         <p>
          New and amended motions for new trial, filed in 2009 and 2011, would not satisfy the plain language of the 1980 statute because those motions were not filed within the time provided by rule of the court; the motions were not presented to the original judge within 30 days of the order of defendant's sentences because these motions existed only by virtue of the delayed appeal, and because none of defendant's motions for new trial fell within the scope of the prior statute, its terms were inapplicable and did not afford a basis for relief. State v. Hall, 461 S.W.3d 469, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 241 (Tenn. Mar. 20, 2015), cert. denied, Hall v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">193 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 349, <cite class="s_court">136 S.

          Successor judge specified that he would consider certain testimony as it related to the use of shackles on defendant. Because this was an issue raised in defendant's new and amended motions for new trial that were filed as a part of the delayed appeal, this evidence was properly considered by the judge Blackwood when determining whether he could rule on the motions for new trial. State v. Hall, 461 S.W.3d 469, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 241 (Tenn. Mar. 20, 2015), cert. denied, Hall v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">193 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 349, <cite class="s_court">136 S.

          Witness credibility was not presented as an overriding issue that might have rendered the successor judge unable to rule upon the motions for new trial. State v.

           Any policy requiring an incoming judge to continue the employment of an outgoing judge's secretarial assistant, whom the incoming judge may not know and with whom the incoming judge may not have an established positive working relationship, would pose a risk of undermining the efficient functioning of the judicial system. Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (Tenn. Mar. 28, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
           Trial judge must remain free to select, supervise, and remove the secretarial assistant, and in turn, the secretarial assistant must remain free to leave the employment at any time should the secretarial assistant's working relationship with the trial judge become strained or dysfunctional; these purposes are served by the employment-at-will-doctrine. Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (Tenn. Mar. 28, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
           When a trial judge's service ends, whether by term expiration, death, resignation, election defeat, or otherwise, the secretarial assistant's employment also ends; although secretarial assistants to outgoing judges may seek to obtain employment with an incoming judge, the incoming judge has no obligation to hire the secretarial assistant, and the secretarial assistant has no claim of right to continue in the position. Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (Tenn. Mar. 28, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
           Trial judge secretarial assistants have occasionally been extended temporary employment in extraordinary circumstances, in the interim between a judge leaving office unexpectedly during a term (most often because of death or sudden, unexpected resignation) and a new judge being selected; such rare and temporary arrangements do not alter the at-will nature of a trial judge secretarial assistant's employment status. Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (Tenn. Mar. 28, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
           Secretarial assistant's complaint against an elected trial judge failed to state a claim for tortious interference with her employment relationship because her employment automatically ended when the former trial judge's term ended, and the assistant remained employed until the end of the former judge's term; while the assistant had the right to seek new employment with the elected judge, she had no entitlement to the position. Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (Tenn. Mar. 28, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
           Trial judge's secretarial assistant is an at-will employee, and as a result, the secretarial assistant's employment may be terminated at any time during the term of the trial judge to whom he or she is assigned, either by the judge or the secretarial assistant; if the relationship is not terminated during the trial judge's term, the secretarial assistant's employment automatically terminates when the trial judge's service ends. Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 184 (Tenn. Mar. 28, 2017).

        A judge whose wife is a sister to the mother of a litigant is disqualified, because of connection by affinity; but a judge whose son's wife is an aunt of a litigant is not disqualified, there being no connection by affinity. Waterhouse v. Martin, 7 Tenn. 373, 7 Tenn. 374, 1824 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1824); Hume v. Commercial Bank, 78 Tenn. 1, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 131, 43 Am. Rep. 290 (1882).

        A judge, who previous to his election to the bench, sent the bill of indictment against the prisoner is disqualified in that case. Mathis v. State, 50 Tenn. 127, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was denied the right to a fair trial because of counsel's errors in that the failure of defense counsel to adequately investigate and support a motion for the recusal of the presiding trial judge resulted in prejudice to defendant, and defendant was denied the right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal; the potential injury to the judicial process due to the appearance of impropriety and unfair lack of impartiality by a judge imposing a death sentence was too great to allow the sentence of death to stand. The judge's former role as the prosecutor of defendant on other criminal charges at the same time as his trial for murder, multiple and regular instances of communication between the judge and other prosecutors regarding defendant's criminal cases, and the judge's acquisition of defendant's statement regarding his involvement in the murders compelled a conclusion that Strickland  prejudice had been established by, among other things, operation of the denial of due process and the specter of potential unfairness. Smith v. State, 357 S.W.3d 322, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 1152 (Tenn. Dec. 19, 2011), cert. denied, Smith v. Tennessee, <cite class="l_ed">184 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 48, <cite class="s_court">133 S.

       <p>
        If a judge has the slightest interest in a cause, he is incompetent to preside on its trial, both by the common law and by Tenn. Const., art. VI, § 11. Neely v. State, 63 Tenn. 174, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 224 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a suit involved the constitutionality of the 1932 code, and that the supreme court in accordance with statute appointed the code commission which drafted the code, and publicly commended the industry and ability of the commissioners, did not disqualify the justices of that court to hear the cause. Interest as a citizen in a public question does not disqualify. Chumbley v. People's Bank & Trust Co., 165 Tenn. 655, 57 S.W.2d 787, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 100 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that a trial judge in a divorce proceeding had an office sharing arrangement with the lawyer of one of the parties to the divorce proceeding during a portion of the time that the lawyer was representing the party in a different matter did not require the judge's recusal. Kinard v. Kinard, 986 S.W.2d 220, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), modified, 986 S.W.2d 220, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 598 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a judge was once professionally associated with a lawyer for one of the parties in a case is not, without more, grounds for disqualification. Kinard v. Kinard, 986 S.W.2d 220, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 543 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), modified, 986 S.W.2d 220, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 598 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998).

       </h4>
       <p>
        A judge who, before he has tried the case, declares that he can prove defendant's guilt whether defendant confesses or not, is incompetent under spirit of this section, but where the judge denies such decision in advance, it must be made to appear beyond any doubt that such decision had been made. In re Cameron, 126 Tenn. 614, 151 S.W. 64, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        In absence of bill of exceptions Court of Appeals would presume that question of prejudice of presiding judge was resolved against appellant. Talley v. Talley, 51 Tenn. App. 622, 371 S.W.2d 152, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 126 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        In habeas corpus proceeding, judge who had previously expressed himself to effect that the petitioner had already served enough time in the penitentiary and to the effect that he intended to grant the petition regardless of proof should have excused himself and failure to do so required reversal of judgment sustaining petition and required that case be remanded for trial before impartial judge. Leighton v. Henderson, 220 Tenn. 91, 414 S.W.2d 419, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 392 (1967).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Confession of judgment in writing waives incompetency of a justice on account of relationship, and estops the party to question the validity of the judgment on account of such incompetency. Hilton v. Dan'l Miller & Co., 73 Tenn. 395, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 148 (1880); Holmes v. Eason, 76 Tenn. 754, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no objection is made on account of incompetency, and the parties go to trial upon the merits, the proceedings are not void. If the incompetency is waived in writing, or by entry of record, the judgment is valid in all respects. Certain incompetencies are waived by going to trial without objection. Posey v. Eaton, 77 Tenn. 500, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1882); Holmes v. Eason, 76 Tenn. 754, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1882); Hume v. Commercial Bank, 78 Tenn. 1, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 131, 43 Am. Rep. 290 (1882); Radford Trust Co. v. East Tenn. Lumber Co., 92 Tenn. 126, 21 S.W. 329, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1892); Grundy County v. Tennessee C., I. &amp; R.R., 94 Tenn. 295, 29 S.W. 116, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 46 (1895); Cooper v. Hamilton Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 97 Tenn. 285, 37 S.W. 12, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 141, <cite class="am_st_r">56 Am.

       </p>
       <p>
        The right to be tried by a judge who is constitutionally qualified can be waived, but such waiver must be voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently given. State v. Blackmon, 984 S.W.2d 589, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 747 (Tenn. 1998).

       <p>
        The objection cannot be made for the first time on appeal, where the trial is de novo in the circuit court, and the objection should come before trial is had on the merits. Wroe v. Greer, 32 Tenn. 172, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1852); Hilton v. Dan'l Miller & Co., 73 Tenn. 395, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 148 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incompetency of judge, held waived in civil case for failure to make objection in limine on the hearing. Obion County use of Houser Creek Drainage Dist. v. Coulter, 153 Tenn. 469, 284 S.W. 372, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants waived recusal when the trial judge advised the parties at the beginning of the first trial that he knew the plaintiffs and had attended college with them and defendants did not question his impartiality. Corrado v. Hickman, 113 S.W.3d 319, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 195 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. June 30, 2003).

        Incompetency of trial judge in criminal case cannot be waived by consent of defendant. Hamilton v. State, 218 Tenn. 317, 403 S.W.2d 302, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 569 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to waive disqualification of judge exists in both criminal and civil cases. State ex rel. Roberts v. Henderson, 223 Tenn. 115, 442 S.W.2d 629, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 394 (1969) (overruling Wilson v. State, 153 Tenn. 206, 281 S.W. 151, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1925) holding that defendant cannot waive disqualification in criminal cases).
       </p>
       <p>
        Voluntary plea of guilty amounted to waiver of right to have criminal court judge disqualified on ground that such judge, while general sessions judge, issued warrant for arrest of defendant. State ex rel. Roberts v. Henderson, 223 Tenn. 115, 442 S.W.2d 629, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 394 (1969).

        Where judge of one division of circuit court had filed original divorce suit as an attorney and would have been disqualified to hear petition for change of custody of child, transfer to another division of the court was a more natural solution to the problem than the appointment of a special judge.

        Judge was not required to recuse himself in a case where the defendant was represented by a law firm whose former partner made a contribution to the judge's campaign; plaintiff failed to show that the trial judge had any knowledge of the sources of prior campaign contributions. Todd v. Jackson, 213 S.W.3d 277, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 458 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 1080 (Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction for premeditated first-degree murder and his subsequent sentence to death were both proper because there was no indication in the record before the appellate court that the trial judge prejudged any factual issues that arose related to defendant's re-sentencing hearing; thus, the appellate court was unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for recusal. State v. Rimmer, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 986 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 15, 2006), aff'd, 250 S.W.3d 12, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Feb. 20, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife's alleged death threat against a judge did not give the judge an impermissible interest in the litigation, necessitating recusal, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c02s17-2-101" target="_self">17-2-101</a></cite> as the judge did not have a pecuniary or property interest in the litigation, or a right in the subject matter.

       </p>
       <p>
        Wife's motion to recuse the trial judge was properly denied because the wife failed to show a reasonable basis for questioning the trial judge's impartiality; the trial court did not rule in excess of the relief the husband requested, and the transcript of the contempt hearing reflected no disdain toward the wife. Stark v. Stark, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 302 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 18, 2019), appeal dismissed, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 36 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying a mother's motion for recusal where although the mother had included an affidavit, she had not alleged that the chancellor had a pecuniary or property interest or some other right in the instant litigation, nor had she mentioned the chancellor's kinship to either party, a prior of counsel relationship to either party, or having presided over the trial.

       <p>
        It was error to deny a motion for recusal because, by communicating with an extrajudicial source, the judge learned information concerning facts in dispute, as judge did not solely rely on matters learned in the courtroom or disclose the specifics of the communication, denying the parties a chance to test the source's qualifications. Holsclaw v. Ivy Hall Nursing Home, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 964 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 19, 2016), rev'd, 530 S.W.3d 65, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. Sept. 19, 2017).

        Although plaintiff alleged that the Tennessee Plan and statutes providing for the appointment of special and senior judges violated her constitutional rights, plaintiff failed to allege any injury that was distinguishable from other voters, citizens, or litigants. Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's complaint for lack of standing. Durham v. Haslam, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 236 (Tenn. Ct.

        The general language of Tenn. Const., art. VI, § 4 does not undermine Tenn. Const., art. VI, § 11's specific provision authorizing the general assembly to enact statutory procedures for selecting special judges, and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c02s17-2-116ol1a1" target="_self">17-2-116(a)(1)</a></cite> is entirely consistent with Tenn. Const., art. VI, § 11; therefore, judicial appointments conforming to the statute do not run afoul of Tenn. Const., art. VI, § 4. State ex rel. Witcher v. Bilbrey, 878 S.W.2d 567, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 103 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994).

        If the trial of a civil case is expected to be complex, lengthy or the litigants, for any reason, desire the matter to be disposed of in an expeditious manner, the litigants may, upon joint motion of all parties to the action and with the consent of the appropriate judge, agree to employ a retired or former judge to hear the case.

        The administrative director of the courts shall compile a list of all retired or former Tennessee trial level judges who are willing to sit in special cases pursuant to subsection (a) and the particular expertise of each judge, if any. Upon compiling the list, the administrative director of the courts shall distribute the list to every active trial level judge with civil jurisdiction in this state.

        When the litigants in a civil case agree to employ a retired or former judge pursuant to subsection (a), they shall approach the judge to whom the case was originally assigned. Upon explaining the nature of the litigation, the judge shall give the parties the names of three (3) retired or former judges available to hear the case. If three (3) retired or former judges are not available, the judge shall give them the names of the judges who are available. Where possible, the judge shall match the expertise of the retired or former judge to the particular case in question.

       <li id="t17c02s17-2-121ol1d">
        It shall be the duty of the litigants to decide which retired or former judge to contact, contact the judge, and make all necessary arrangements for the place, date and time of the trial. It shall also be the responsibility of the litigants to compensate the retired or former judge in accordance with § 17-2-106. The clerks and other courthouse officials shall cooperate in helping the litigants find a suitable courtroom for the trial of the case. If no courtroom is available, the case may be tried in any location agreeable to the litigants and retired or former judge.

       <li id="t17c02s17-2-121ol1f">
        Upon the conclusion of the trial, the retired or former judge shall submit the judge's finding to the judge of the court to which the case was originally assigned. The finding of the retired or former judge shall become the finding of the court and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the case had been tried by that court. The finding of the retired or former judge and the judgment of the court may be appealed in the same manner as in any other civil case and shall be governed by the Tennessee rules of appellate procedure.

         Judges may interchange with each other whenever the incompetency of the judge to try a particular case or cases, or personal convenience, may require. Such interchange may be for the entire circuit, or a single term, or part thereof, or for a special case. Elms v. State, 29 Tenn. 128, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1849); Dupuis v. Hand, 814 S.W.2d 340, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. 1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not improper for a judge of one circuit to sit by interchange for a judge of another circuit and there is no requirement that application be made to the chief justice for assignment of a judge to the case. State ex rel. Stall v. Knoxville, 211 Tenn. 271, 364 S.W.2d 898, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 357 (1962), cert. denied, Tennessee ex rel. Stall v.

Upon the termination of the court of the judiciary, the board of judicial conduct is expressly granted the same powers and duties as set forth above for the court of the judiciary in order to carry out its responsibilities established this chapter. The board of judicial conduct also is expressly authorized to continue any preliminary investigations, full investigations, and/or trials scheduled or in progress by the court of the judiciary at the time of termination of the court of the judiciary.

        Attorney General Opinions. A private act proposing to authorize a general sessions judge to interchange with a chancellor in a particular county should articulate the reasons why such authority is necessary or convenient to the operation of the judicial system in the affected county, as such an act would violate the constitution absent a rational basis for suspending the general law with regard to interchange in the particular county, OAG 02-074 (6/12/02).

         Trial judge had jurisdiction to try appellant attorney for contempt under the interchange provisions; because the appellant's charges of contempt implicated two judges in the first judicial district as witnesses, all the judges of the first judicial district recused themselves from hearing the case, and accordingly, the presiding judge of the first judicial district requested a judge from the second judicial district to hear the contempt proceedings.

In other words, our interchange framework does not grant a court that otherwise lacks subject matter jurisdiction the power to adjudicate the case; it simply authorizes judges from other courts to sit by interchange in a court with subject matter jurisdiction when the original judge cannot preside over the matter for whatever reason.

         In counties with a population of over seven hundred thousand (700,000), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, the general sessions judges may sit by interchange as a circuit court judge or chancellor for the exclusive purpose of hearing and deciding uncontested and irreconcilable differences in divorce cases.

         When the circuit court clerk or clerk and master determines that a pending divorce action is uncontested as to all material facts or issues, or when the clerk determines that the ground relied upon in a pending divorce action is irreconcilable differences between the parties pursuant to § 36-4-101, the clerk may so certify such determinations to the circuit court judge or chancellor.

        <li id="t17c02s17-2-209ol1c">
         The circuit court judge or chancellor may designate that a general sessions judge sit by interchange to hear and decide any divorce action determined by the clerk to be uncontested or based upon irreconcilable differences. Any decree entered by a general sessions judge sitting by interchange pursuant to this section shall be considered a decree of the circuit or chancery court and any petitions for modification of the decree shall be filed in the circuit or chancery court. All appeals from the decision of a general sessions judge sitting by interchange pursuant to this section shall be taken in the same manner as if the circuit judge or chancellor rendered the decision.

         Attorney General Opinions. Proposed legislation that gives the Tennessee Supreme Court the authority to appoint any former judge or justice who has at least one year of judicial service to serve as “a senior judge to hear complex commercial disputes” raises significant constitutional concerns. Unlike existing law, the proposed legislation would permit a former judge who has minimal judicial experience and who has never won a judicial election to serve in a judicial capacity. Such appointment would not be temporary but would be for a four-year term, renewable without limitation at the discretion of the Supreme Court. OAG 18-14, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 15 (3/23/2018).

         The proposed legislation that would allow the Supreme Court to transfer complex commercial cases from the assigned trial court judge to a senior business judge does itself not raise constitutional concerns. It constitutes a specific grant of authority to transfer cases in furtherance of the Supreme Court’s existing supervisory authority. OAG 18-14, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 15 (3/23/2018).

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment rewrote the section which read: “(a) There is established as a part of the judicial branch of the state a judicial nominating commission, to be composed of seventeen (17) members as follows:“(1) Eight (8) members shall be appointed by the speaker of the senate;“(A) Two (2) of the members shall be appointed from each of the state's three (3) grand divisions, and the remaining two (2) members shall be appointed at-large; and“(B) At least five (5) of the members shall be attorneys;“(2) Eight (8) members shall be appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives;“(A) Two (2) of the members shall be appointed from each of the state's three (3) grand divisions, and the remaining two (2) members shall be appointed at-large; and“(B) At least five (5) of the members shall be attorneys;“(3) One (1) non-attorney member shall be appointed at-large by joint action of the speaker of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives; and“(4) Not more than three (3) of the members appointed at-large may be residents of the same grand division.“(b)(1) The entire membership of the judicial selection commission shall be vacated and shall be replaced by new appointments made to the judicial nominating commission pursuant to this section. In order to stagger the terms of the newly appointed commission members, initial appointments shall be made as follows:“(A) Two (2) of the speaker of the senates's initial appointments shall be made for terms of two (2) years each;“(B) Two (2) of the speaker of the house's initial appointments shall be made for terms of two (2) years each;“(C) The speakers' joint appointment shall be made for a term of two (2) years;“(D) Three (3) of the speaker of the senate's initial appointments shall be made for terms of four (4) years each;“(E) Three (3) of the speaker of the house's initial appointments shall be made for terms of four (4) years each;“(F) Three (3) of the speaker of the senate's initial appointments shall be made for terms of six (6) years each; and“(G) Three (3) of the speaker of the house's initial appointments shall be made for terms of six (6) years each.“(2) Thereafter, the terms for all appointments shall comply with §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c04s17-4-106" target="_self">17-4-106</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c04s17-4-107ol1a" target="_self">17-4-107(a)</a></cite>.“(c) In making the appointments to the judicial nominating commission, each speaker shall do so with a conscious intention of selecting a body that reflects diversity with respect to:“(1) Race, including the dominant ethnic minority population;“(2) Gender; and“(3) Representation of rural areas as well as urban centers.“(d) The administrative office of the courts shall develop and post on its web site a downloadable information and application form for citizens who wish to be considered for appointment to the judicial nominating commission. The form shall indicate all qualifications required for appointment to the commission. To be considered for appointment, each applicant must complete, sign and submit the form. Appropriate deadlines for submission of the forms shall be established by the administrative office of the courts in advance of each scheduled vacancy and promptly after the occurrence of any unscheduled vacancy. Each time that deadlines are so established, in addition to notice posted on its web site, the administrative office of the courts shall take appropriate action to notify the general public and shall provide written notification to the speaker of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives. Immediately following the occurrence of any such deadline, the administrative office of the courts shall post on its web site a summary report of all qualified applicants for the vacant position or positions. The summary report shall include at least the name, county of residence and occupation of each applicant. For a period of fourteen (14) days following the posting of the summary report, the administrative office of the courts shall receive public comments from interested persons and organizations. At the conclusion of the period for public comments, the application forms and corresponding public comments shall be forwarded to the appropriate speaker or speakers for consideration and action. Within fourteen (14) days following receipt of the information, the speaker or speakers shall make the required appointments from the pool of qualified applicants. However, for good cause, either speaker may fill a vacancy by appointing a qualified person not included within the pool of applicants if the speaker provides written notice to the administrative office of the courts stating the reasons for appointing a person not included within the pool of applicants.”

       The regulation of judicial conduct is critical to preserving the integrity of the judiciary and enhancing public confidence in the judicial system. This chapter is intended to provide an orderly and efficient method for making inquiry into the physical, mental, and moral fitness of any Tennessee judge; the judge's manner of performance of duty; and the judge's commission of any act that reflects unfavorably upon the judiciary of the state or brings the judiciary into disrepute or that may adversely affect the administration of justice in this state. This chapter further is intended to provide a process by which appropriate sanctions may be imposed.

        The general assembly did not violate the separation of powers clause of the state constitution in creating the court of the judiciary, authorizing it to recommend the removal of judges and in providing for an appellate review of any such recommendation. In re Murphy, 726 S.W.2d 509, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 858 (Tenn. 1987) (decided under former T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c05s17-5-101" target="_self">17-5-101</a></cite>).

        The legislative purpose expressed in former T.C. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c05s17-5-101" target="_self">17-5-101</a></cite> prevented the court of the judiciary from being subject to Tenn. Const., art. VI, § 4. It was not a circuit or chancery court or other inferior court and it was not “assigned” any district in this state. It was clearly and completely outside the state court system as established by art. VI of the constitution. In re Murphy, 726 S.W.2d 509, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 858 (Tenn. 1987) (decided under former T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c05s17-5-101" target="_self">17-5-101</a></cite>).

          The disciplinary counsel shall evaluate all information coming to the disciplinary counsel's attention by complaint, upon the request of any member of the board, or from any other credible source that alleges judicial misconduct or incapacity within fourteen (14) days of the date of a written complaint being filed, a request being submitted, or the receipt of information from a credible source alleging judicial misconduct or incapacity.
         </li>
         <li id="t17c05s17-5-303ol1b">
          In instances in which a complaint is filed, the complaint must be submitted in writing, must contain the name of the complainant, must be signed by the complainant, and must allege specific facts directly relating to the alleged misconduct or incapacity of the judge in question. The disciplinary counsel shall review all complaints and if, in the judgment of the disciplinary counsel, the complaint establishes probable cause that the conduct complained of occurred and violates § 17-5-301(j), the disciplinary counsel shall conduct a preliminary investigation, subject to review by the investigative panel pursuant to subdivision (c)(3). The preliminary investigation must be completed within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the complaint, unless the chair authorizes additional time for the completion of the investigation. If the disciplinary counsel believes the complaint fails to establish probable cause that either the conduct occurred or the conduct constituted a violation of § 17-5-301(j), the disciplinary counsel shall recommend dismissal of the complaint or, if appropriate, refer the matter to another agency. The recommendation for dismissal is subject to review by the investigative panel pursuant to subdivision (c)(3).

            The disciplinary counsel may conduct interviews and examine evidence to determine whether the specific facts alleged are true and, if so, whether the facts establish probable cause that a violation of § 17-5-301(j) has occurred; however, the disciplinary counsel shall not issue a subpoena to obtain testimony or evidence until the investigative panel authorizes a full investigation pursuant to subdivision (c)(3).

           <li id="t17c05s17-5-303ol1c2">
            If the disciplinary counsel believes there is evidence supporting the allegations against a judge, the disciplinary counsel shall recommend to the investigative panel assigned to the case that the panel authorize a full investigation. The disciplinary counsel may also recommend a full investigation when the disciplinary counsel believes there is evidence that would establish probable cause that a violation of § 17-5-301(j) has occurred and such evidence could be obtained by subpoena or further investigation. In all other cases, the disciplinary counsel must recommend that the matter be dismissed. The disciplinary counsel shall make the recommendation to the investigative panel within fourteen (14) days of the disciplinary counsel's completion of the preliminary investigation.

          The formal charges must give fair and adequate notice of the nature of the alleged misconduct or incapacity. The disciplinary counsel shall file the formal charges with the board. The disciplinary counsel shall cause a copy of the formal charges to be served on the judge or the judge's counsel by certified mail and shall file proof of service with the board.

          The general assembly did not violate the separation of powers clause of the state constitution in creating the court of the judiciary, authorizing it to recommend the removal of judges and in providing for an appellate review of any such recommendation.

          It was not necessary that proceedings for removal be held in abeyance until an appeal of criminal conviction in the federal courts was exhausted. In re Murphy, 726 S.W.2d 509, 1987 Tenn.

          If the supreme court affirms the action of the board as provided in § 17-5-308, the judgment of the supreme court is final.

However, if the supreme court affirms the board's action recommending the removal of a judge and its determination that the recommendation is moot as provided in § 17-5-308(c), the matter may not be transmitted to the general assembly for a final determination but is final upon the supreme court's action.
