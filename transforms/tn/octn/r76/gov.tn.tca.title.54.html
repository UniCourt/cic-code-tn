         <p>
          The litter prevention and control program may include as one (1) of its components a process by which citizens can report directly to the department of transportation instances of persons littering from motor vehicles onto the state's roads and highways, whether the offenders are intentionally littering or are accidentally dropping objects or debris from an uncovered or improperly secured load. The process may provide the capability for citizens to report litterers online by means of the completion of a standard form, the form to be accessed via the Internet from the program's web site. The department may also make provisions for citizens to report litterers via e-mail and a toll-free telephone line.

            Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the department is authorized to use the project delivery method of construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) services. The CM/GC method allows the department to engage a construction manager during the design process to provide input on the design. During the design phase, the construction manager provides advice, including, but not limited to, constructability review, scheduling, pricing, and phasing to assist the department in designing a more efficient and well-designed project.

            The department will select CM/GC projects based upon generally accepted industry criteria that include factors such as fostering innovation, mitigating risk, improving design quality, improving cost control, and optimizing construction schedules. Projects suited for the CM/GC process include instances where the department needs feedback during the design phase due to complex components that require innovation. Other projects that are suited for CM/GC are projects that have public involvement, third-party considerations such as acquisition of right-of-way or utility relocation issues, or other factors that impact the overall schedule. Projects not suited for the CM/GC process include routine maintenance and resurfacing projects or other construction projects that present a low level of technical complexity, a low level of risk management, and simple traffic phasing, and that do not have any compelling need for project acceleration.

   Where Private Acts 1933, ch. 26, provided that county road commission of Crockett County created by such act should have exclusive power and authority to make expenditures of county road funds or road money the funds to be paid into the hands of the county trustee and by him placed to credit of the county road account to be drawn out of the account only by a road warrant drawn and payable only out of such funds and properly signed by county chair or judge of such county, such act must be construed as being in pari materia with §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c04s54-4-101" target="_self">54-4-101</a></cite> —<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c04s54-4-104" target="_self">54-4-104</a></cite> and not as repealing such sections by implication, as there was nothing in the act of 1933 limiting the power of the (former) county court of Crockett County to turn the funds over to the state as provided by this section but rather the act of 1933 must be construed as giving the county highway commissioners control of the gas tax funds and other funds until the county court acts.

        Public Acts 1951, ch. 178, outlining procedure to be followed by various counties in the state exercising right of eminent domain in acquiring land for highway purposes is unconstitutional in that § 9 of the act provides that no trial as to assessments shall be held until 12 months after completion of highway since provision results in unreasonable delay contrary to Tenn. Const., art. I, § 17 and since there is no separability clause in the act, and it appears that act would not have been enacted if § 9 had been omitted, the entire act is unconstitutional.

   As between a county and the landowner, the county is not relieved of liability for land taken for highway purposes prior to Acts 1931, ch. 57 (see now §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c05s54-5-111" target="_self">54-5-111</a></cite>) although, under such act, the liability of the state to compensate the landowner is the primary obligation. State Dep't of Highways v. Roseborough, 17 Tenn. App. 403, 68 S.W.2d 132, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 75 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

        The county in which the highway is constructed is liable for the value of the land taken for highway purposes and for damages incident to the construction of such highway by the department. Charleston v. Ailey, 210 Tenn. 211, 357 S.W.2d 339, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 426 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that city was incorporated after county had assumed liability for taking of land for highway purposes and damages incident to taking did not relieve county of such liability even though city had agreed to make payment out of funds loaned by county although under the circumstances the city was also liable to the landowners. Charleston v. Ailey, 210 Tenn. 211, 357 S.W.2d 339, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 426 (1962).

   A landowner whose property is taken or occupied as a result of the construction of a state highway may sue the county wherein the land lies under §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c16s29-16-123" target="_blank">29-16-123</a></cite> for damages to his property, and it is immaterial whether the county wherein the land lies was at fault in any way or whether the county did the act that caused the damage. Jones v. Cocke County, 57 Tenn. App. 496, 420 S.W.2d 587, 1967 Tenn. App. LEXIS 240 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1967).

        Where an embankment was constructed on approaches to bridge in such a way as to severely restrict natural drainage of flood waters resulting in increased flooding and slower drainage of plaintiff's land, suit would lie against county in which land lay even though embankment was in another county and defendant county was not responsible for the acts that caused the flooding. Jones v. Cocke County, 57 Tenn. App. 496, 420 S.W.2d 587, 1967 Tenn. App. LEXIS 240 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1967).

   In an inverse condemnation claim where the property owner sued the city and the county and sought damages to his property resulting from flooding which occurred during and after construction to a road within the city's limits, the county had no involvement whatsoever with the road construction project which took place entirely within the corporate limits of the city on a city street, and where the city was actively involved in the construction project and entered into a contract with the state wherein it agreed to make periodic inspections, to pay a portion of the expenses, and to be responsible for maintenance once the project was completed; thus, the trial court properly granted the county's motion for summary judgment and found that it was not liable for damages to the owner under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c05s54-5-106" target="_self">54-5-106</a></cite>. Leonard v. Knox County, 146 S.W.3d 589, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 178 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 1237 (Tenn. Oct. 4, 2004).

        Where counsel for a county brought suit to condemn land for highway purposes and joined as copetitioners with the county the state of Tennessee and its commissioner in the good faith belief that they were, in law, authorized to use the name of the state and its commissioner as copetitioners, but who were in fact without such authority, and, upon discovering their mistake, filed a supplemental petition praying that the state and its commissioner be brought before the court by proper process and required to pay and satisfy any judgment obtained in the cause, it amounted to an adversary proceeding against the state and an officer of the state, acting by authority of the state, with a view to reaching the treasury of the state and its funds and property, and a demurrer to the supplemental petition, setting up these grounds, should have been sustained.

        Right of commissioner of highways (now commissioner of transportation) to lay out projects is purely discretionary and court is without jurisdiction, power or authority to review his decision or to require him to construct such a project in a manner that he does not deem best. State ex rel. Moulton v. Williams, 207 Tenn. 695, 343 S.W.2d 857, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 387 (1961).

        Commissioner could not make a contract as to the location of a road that would be binding upon himself or his successor, where it later appeared that a deviation from the route agreed upon was required by public welfare.

        Though a private act had required a particular road to run in a prescribed way, the commissioner was empowered to alter the course of the road where the deviation was one third of a mile and necessary to make the highway conform to federal aid requirements. State Highway Dep't v. Mitchell's Heirs, 142 Tenn. 58, 216 S.W. 336, 1919 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1919); Liles v. Creveling, 151 Tenn. 61, 268 S.W. 625, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1925).

       <p>
        Ordinarily, and as far as the public interest will permit, a main traveled road should be followed, but whenever by reason of undue expense or physical obstacles this is not feasible, the commissioner may choose another route or not build at all.

        The attorney general need not consent to a condemnation proceeding for state highway right-of-way or join as a party, but he merely represents the department in the litigation. Department of Highways & Public Works v. Gamble, 18 Tenn. App. 95, 73 S.W.2d 175, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 16 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).

        Adequate provision for compensation is made, so that execution of a bond as a condition to entry and work on the land is not requisite. State Highway Dep't v.

        Fact that city was incorporated after county had assumed liability for taking of land for highway purposes and damages incident to taking did not relieve county of such liability even though city had agreed to make payment out of funds loaned by county although under the circumstances the city was also liable.

   Where a county instituted a condemnation proceeding to obtain a right-of-way for a state highway, and a deputy state attorney general, representing the state, joined in a stipulation for continuance of the case to the next term of court, either as plaintiff or defendant, as the law might require, such appearance by the deputy attorney general was a general appearance, estopping the state to assert its immunity under §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.20.html#t20c13s20-13-102" target="_blank">20-13-102</a></cite>.

        The appropriation of state funds to retire county indebtedness is one for state purposes for which the state's power to tax may be exercised constitutionally, nor is there a lending or giving of state's credit in violation of Tenn.

When a refunding bond is given and the retainage withdrawn by the contractor, the commissioner passes out of the picture. Standard Oil Co. v.

        Where the proceeding is not brought under the highway act and the bureau (now department) has no interest in the suit, the reason for localizing the action ceases, and the rule itself ceases, and the general rule that provides that actions on bonds of this character are transitory applies.

        Public Acts 1913, ch. 26, was not unconstitutional on the theory that the act contained more than one subject. Walmsley v. Franklin County, 133 Tenn. 579, 182 S.W. 599, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1916).

        The statute evidences a legislative intent to leave to the county court's (now county legislative body's) determination the question whether there had been compliance with the statutory conditions precedent to the issuance of highway bonds.

   The provision requiring the issuance of bonds and coupons under seal is merely directory insofar as the coupons are concerned, and the validity of the coupons may, in this respect, rest on the bonds to which the seal was attached. Henderson County v. Sovereign Camp, W. O. W., 12 F.2d 883, 1926 U.S. App. LEXIS 3403 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1926), cert. denied, Henderson County v.

        Recitals in bonds showing issuance in strict conformity to law estops county as to bona fide holders. Irwin v. Bedford County, 151 Tenn. 402, 270 S.W. 81, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   Where legislative authority exists for issuing the bonds in some circumstances, and the bonds recite on their face that they were issued pursuant to statute and are attested by the officers who were authorized under the statute to issue such bonds, a prima facie case of validity is made out. Henderson County v. Sovereign Camp, W. O. W., 12 F.2d 883, 1926 U.S. App. LEXIS 3403 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1926), cert. denied, Henderson County v.

       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   The grant of power to the county court (now county legislative body) to issue bonds is in praesenti, with a deferred right to exercise it, depending upon the happening of certain conditions, it being the province of the county court (now county legislative body) to determine whether those conditions have been fulfilled, and when that court certifies on the face of the bonds the fulfillment of such conditions, the county is estopped as against innocent holders, to assert the contrary. Henderson County v. Sovereign Camp, W. O. W., 12 F.2d 883, 1926 U.S. App. LEXIS 3403 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1926), cert. denied, Henderson County v.

       For the purpose of carrying out this chapter, any county legislative body has the right to divide its county into no less than three (3) nor more than eight (8) road districts. For each road district, there shall be elected one (1) road commissioner, so that no more than one (1) road commissioner shall be elected from the same road district; but to divide the county into road districts the road districts shall in no wise interfere with the civil districts of any county, for any purpose whatever, except for convenience in selecting the commissioners for the purpose of giving all parts of any county representation in the construction of roads under this chapter.

        Roadways acquired under ch. 14 of this title authorized persons without adequate and convenient outlet to public highway to condemn right-of-way across private property of another are public only in the sense that the statutes authorizing them do not violate the constitutional principle that private property cannot be taken for private purpose but only for public use.

        The fact that a highway is used chiefly by a private individual and is opened and maintained at his private expense does not make it a private highway where the statute declares it public and the whole public has the right to use the way.

   A “public road” is a way open to all the people, without distinction, for passage and repassage at their pleasure. Sumner County v. Interurban Transp. Co., 141 Tenn. 493, 213 S.W. 412, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 112, <cite class="alr">5 A.L.R. 765</cite> (1919), overruled in part, Newport v. Brewer, 566 S.W.2d 873, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 565 (Tenn. 1978).

        A public highway is such a passageway as any and all members of the public have an absolute right to use as distinguished from a permissive privilege of using same. Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Hughes, 203 Tenn. 636, 315 S.W.2d 239, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 229 (1958).

   Every member of the public has the right to use the public roads in a reasonable manner for the promotion of his health and happiness, but such use is restricted to a use with due care and in a reasonable manner. Sumner County v. Interurban Transp. Co., 141 Tenn. 493, 213 S.W. 412, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 112, <cite class="alr">5 A.L.R. 765</cite> (1919), overruled in part, Newport v.

       <p>
        By Acts 1819, ch. 26, parol evidence was admissible to establish the public character of a road and was sufficient to make a prima facie case, until the contrary was made to appear by the production of the county court (now county legislative body) records. Mankin v. State, 32 Tenn. 206, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute, providing for the opening of a road through privately owned lands at the instance and primarily for the benefit of an otherwise confined private landowner, is constitutional, as under this section, the road became public on its opening. Derryberry v. Beck, 153 Tenn. 220, 280 S.W. 1014, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless a passageway has been created a public way in some manner known to the law, such as by act of the public authorities, or by express dedication of the owner, or by implied dedication by means of the use by the public and acceptance by them with the intention of the owner that the use become public or by adverse user for a period of 20 years continuously creating prescriptive right, it is not a public way. Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Hughes, 203 Tenn. 636, 315 S.W.2d 239, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 229 (1958).

        Dedication by the landowner, and acceptance and adverse user by the public, are sufficient, without any action of the county legislative body to establish a public road. Young v.

       <p>
        The dedication of a way to the public by one of the several tenants in common, without the consent of the others, either express or implied, is not valid. Scott v. Cheatham, 59 Tenn. 713, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stipulation in a deed conveying land that a street shall be extended through the same is valid and enforceable. Crutchfield v. Wason Car Works, 67 Tenn. 242, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 364 (1874); Boyd v. Hunt, 102 Tenn. 495, 52 S.W. 131, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute was not intended to destroy the right of dedication to public uses as it has always existed. Roberts v. Columbia, G. & S. F. Turnpike Co., 98 Tenn. 133, 38 S.W. 587, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        The dedication by the mortgagor of his mortgaged lands for a public road, where the mortgagee makes no objection, is not invalid for that reason, and third persons cannot object. The mortgagee only can object. Roberts v. Columbia, G. & S. F. Turnpike Co., 98 Tenn. 133, 38 S.W. 587, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        A road was sufficiently dedicated to the public for a public road, where it had been accepted by the county court (now county legislative body) as a public road, and hands had been assigned to work it for years. Guinn v. Eaves, 117 Tenn. 524, 101 S.W. 1154, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remaindermen are not affected by the life tenant's dedication for a road. McKinney v. Duncan, 121 Tenn. 265, 118 S.W. 683, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the factors that indicate an intent to dedicate a private as a public road are: The landowner opens a road to public travel; acquiescence in the use of the road as a public road, and the fact the public has used the road for an extended period of time. While dedication is not dependent on duration of the use, extended use is a circumstance tending to show an intent to dedicate. Finally, an intent to dedicate is inferable when the roadway is repaired and maintained by the public. Rogers v. Sain, 679 S.W.2d 450, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2968 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984) (road was dedicated by implication as a public road).
       </p>
       <p>
        An offer of dedication of a private alley as a public alley must be accepted before a dedication to public use is complete. Public acceptance of an offer of dedication may consist of either a formal act on the part of public authorities or common use by the general public. State ex rel. Matthews v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, 679 S.W.2d 946, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 881 (Tenn. 1984).

       <p>
        The acceptance of a street by a city may be implied from a general long continued use thereof by the public, under a claim of right, and such use may operate as an acceptance thereof, so as to bind the dedicator and make the dedication irrevocable. Doyle v. Chattanooga, 128 Tenn. 433, 161 S.W. 997, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1913).

        The mere nonuser of a public road will not work an abandonment of the same as against the public, and the right to obstruct a public way cannot rest upon prescription. Elkins v.

         The power to open or change public roads is a prerogative of sovereignty, and when delegated to the county court (now county legislative body), such power is exercised by it as a police or legislative function, rather than a judicial act, but the act is judicial where the courts undertake to adjudicate the rights of parties in a case properly within their jurisdiction, as the amount of compensation and damages to which the landowner is entitled.

         The proper mode of making application for opening or changing a public road was by petition, and such petition could be required, but a less formal application would be good if entertained without objection.

         Under the prior law, if a private person obstructed a public road and changed its course without authority, a fresh cause of action for the penalty accrued at the end of each month, from the time of obstruction, and the statute of limitations formed no bar as to monthly penalties accruing within 12 months.

         The report of the jury of view was only intended to inform the county court (now general sessions court) of the facts, by which such court might be enabled to act on the subject, and would have no weight with the circuit court where the facts are fully investigated in that court by the introduction of witnesses, for the report of a jury of view is altogether superseded by a broad appeal upon the merits. Patton v. Clark, 17 Tenn. 268, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1836); Hawkins v. Justices of Trousdale County, 80 Tenn. 351, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1883).

        <p>
         The object of a jury of view was to bring before the court the facts upon which the court was to determine whether the application for laying out and establishing a road should be granted, but, upon the return of the jury of view, the case was open for proof on both sides, as to the propriety of laying out and establishing the road. Justices of Greene County v. Graham, 65 Tenn. 77, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 305 (1873); Hawkins v. Justices of Trousdale County, 80 Tenn. 351, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1883).

        <p>
         The circuit court could properly refuse to confirm the report of a jury of view, which, while locating the road over the land of the applicant, contained conditions for his benefit, and not for the public. The circuit court should, however, have heard the proof offered by the appellant, and have determined the case. Hawkins v. Justices of Trousdale County, 80 Tenn. 351, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 179 (1883).

         While, in general, the county courts (now general sessions courts) are infinitely more competent to determine questions respecting roads than the supreme court, yet the supreme court would be constrained to reverse the order of the county court establishing a public road, where the road operated as a considerable injury to an individual, and a few individuals only were benefited.

         The supreme court would affirm the judgment of the circuit judge reversing the action of the county court (now general sessions court) in establishing a public road, where the advisability of the road was doubtful, and only a small number of a small community would be benefited thereby, and very serious harm would have been done to an individual by the establishment of the road over his land.

After adopting the provisions of this section, each application to close a designated public road in the county shall be made in writing to the chief administrative officer. Upon receiving an application to close a public road, the chief administrative officer shall give notice to interested parties as provided in this part. The chief administrative officer shall make a recommendation to the regional planning commission regarding whether or not the public road should be closed. Before making any recommendation with respect to closing a road pursuant to this section, the regional planning commission shall provide notice of the action either by written notice mailed to affected property owners or by notice advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the county not less than fourteen (14) days before the recommendation is made. After receiving the recommendation of the chief administrative officer, the regional planning commission shall make its recommendation to the county legislative body, and shall attach the recommendation of the chief administrative officer.

       <p>
        A private act conferring authority upon a county to open, close, change or create a system of roads and bridges gives no broader authority with respect to roads than is given under the general statutes. Cartwright v. Bell, 57 Tenn. App. 352, 418 S.W.2d 463, 1967 Tenn. App. LEXIS 234 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1967).

       </h4>
       <p>
        Where justices of a county (now members of a county legislative body), under the honest belief that they had power to do so, contracted for the construction of a second-class road and the contractor built the road and a special tax was levied for payment of the contract price, the collection of which was enjoined on the ground that it was illegal and ultra vires, the justices (now members) are not individually liable to the contractor for the contract price.

        This section authorizes the county court (now county legislative body) to allow the erection of milldams across waters not navigable in the proper, legal, or ordinary sense. Irwin v. Brown, 3 Shan. 309, 12 S.W. 340 (1889); Allison v. Davidson, 39 S.W. 905, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 102 (Tenn. Ch. App. Nov. 28, 1896).

Vinson v. Nashville, C. &amp; S. L. Ry., 45 Tenn. App. 161, 321 S.W.2d 841, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).

       The language used in this section covers every situation where a party is without an adequate and convenient outlet to a public road. DeBusk v. Riley, 154 Tenn. 381, 289 S.W. 493, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 137 (1926); Fite v. Gassaway, 27 Tenn. App. 692, 184 S.W.2d 564, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 55 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).

       An inadequate way may be widened and gates, if any, removed upon the owner of the servient estate being adequately compensated. DeBusk v. Riley, 154 Tenn. 381, 289 S.W. 493, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 137 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute was passed for the benefit of landowners whose lands are cut off from access to a public road, “by the intervening lands of another,” and petitioner's right to condemn a right-of-way is not affected by the fact that after leaving the right-of-way he must cross other lands of his own to reach a public road. Brady v. Correll, 20 Tenn. App. 224, 97 S.W.2d 448, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was shown that the only egress and ingress to plaintiff's land was by water and that this was not adequate or convenient, the plaintiff was allowed to invoke this section. Brady v. Correll, 20 Tenn. App. 224, 97 S.W.2d 448, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff was allowed to acquire a right-of-way over defendant's land where he could show that the only exit via his own land would require the construction of a road over high, steep, rough hills, and even then this exit would not be convenient or adequate. Fite v. Gassaway, 27 Tenn. App. 692, 184 S.W.2d 564, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 55 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       General assembly had no intention of restricting the right-of-way to any way out; they plainly say if the outlet is not “adequate and convenient” the shut-in may condemn a way out. Swicegood v. Feezell, 29 Tenn. App. 348, 196 S.W.2d 713, 1946 Tenn. App. LEXIS 73 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of this statute has been construed to cover every situation where a party is without an adequate and convenient outlet to a public road, but relief will not be withheld because the party seeking to condemn has another outlet that is not adequate and convenient or because, at great expense, another outlet might be provided that would still be inadequate. Lay v. Pi Beta Phi, Inc., 30 Tenn. App. 423, 207 S.W.2d 4, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 99 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).

       It was error to enjoin a neighbor's use of a causeway over a navigable river to reach the neighbor's island property because: (1) landowners had no exclusive right to the causeway under an Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) permit; (2) only the Corps controlled the causeway; and (3) the Corps did not limit access.

       Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to find rights to use a causeway over a navigable river in the context of a claim for private condemnation of an easement because federal courts had no exclusive jurisdiction.

      <p>
       By condemnation the petitioner does not become vested with the fee to the land condemned for a right-of-way but only has an easement which reverts upon nonuse to the owner of the servient estate. Brady v. Correll, 20 Tenn. App. 224, 97 S.W.2d 448, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not inconsistent in an action to acquire a right-of-way over another's land to plead both a right by prescription and also to ask for condemnation since both ask for the same relief, the title to the land. Fite v. Gassaway, 27 Tenn. App. 692, 184 S.W.2d 564, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 55 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       A right or interest already owned by condemner may be increased and the fact that the condemner already owns some interest in the property is not a bar to his acquisition under the right of eminent domain of the fee title, or of some other additional or increased interest. Lay v. Pi Beta Phi, Inc., 30 Tenn. App. 423, 207 S.W.2d 4, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 99 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).
      </p>

       <p>
   By condemning an easement pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c14s54-14-102" target="_self">54-14-102</a></cite>, dominant tenement owner did not acquire title to the strip of property over which the easement lay; rather, all that was acquired was the right to use the property for the limited purpose of ingress to and egress from the owner's landlocked property. Mills v. Solomon, 43 S.W.3d 503, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 545 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>

   It was error to hold a neighbor's boat access to island land made T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c14s54-14-102ol1a" target="_self">54-14-102(a)</a></cite> inapplicable to allow the neighbor access over landowners' causeway because: (1) this did not defeat a private condemnation action; (2) such boat access was not adequate or convenient; and (3) it was impractical to make the neighbor build another causeway, so the neighbor was entitled to private condemnation of an easement over the landowners' land to access a public road. Walker v. Smith, — S.W.3d —, 2014 Tenn. App. LEXIS 406 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 11, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the trial court found that plaintiffs had an adequate and convenient outlet to a public road by virtue of the grant of the right-of-way by their neighbors, plaintiffs could not seek to condemn an easement under either T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c14s54-14-101" target="_self">54-14-101</a></cite> or §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t54c14s54-14-102" target="_self">54-14-102</a></cite>.

       Where an objection merely asserts there is a constitutional question involved and the court is not cited to a constitutional provision, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction. Brady v. Correll, 20 Tenn. App. 224, 97 S.W.2d 448, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 15 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

       Sections 54-14-102 — 54-14-117 shall not apply where the landowner has an adequate and convenient outlet nor do such sections warrant condemnation as a mere matter of convenience. Vinson v.

       Where a sixty-acre tract of landlocked land and a fifty-foot easement were leased and a contract for an option to purchase land excluded the sixty-acre leased tract from the option, remand was necessary because: (1) The option agreement excluded only the sixty-acre tract of land originally leased and did not exclude the easement tract; and (2) It was necessary to make a determination of the easement to which defendants were entitled pursuant to statutory provisions.

The department must send the notice of the failure to renew within sixty (60) days after the failure to renew. The failure to renew may be remedied by submitting a late renewal form and paying the annual permit renewal fee together with a late fee, in the total amount of two hundred dollars ($200), within one hundred twenty (120) days of receipt of the notice. If a permit holder fails to renew the permit within this one-hundred-twenty-day notice period, then the permit is void and the outdoor advertising device is considered unlawful and subject to removal as further provided in § 54-21-105.

       Prior to invoking this section, the commissioner shall give notice either by certified mail or by personal service to the owner of the outdoor advertising device or occupant of the land on which the outdoor advertising device is located. The notice must specify the basis for the alleged unlawfulness, the remedial action that is required to correct the unlawfulness, and advise that a failure to take the remedial action or request a hearing within forty-five (45) days results in the sign being subject to removal. In addition, the commissioner must give, or have previously given, the owner or operator of the outdoor advertising device an opportunity to request a contested case hearing in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, to determine the lawfulness of the outdoor advertising device. For good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the forty-five-day period for remedial action for up to an additional one hundred fifty (150) days, so long as all advertising content is removed from the unlawful outdoor advertising device within the forty-five-day period. If advertising content is placed on the outdoor advertising device during any extended period, the outdoor advertising device may be immediately removed by the commissioner without further notice. The owner of the outdoor advertising device is liable to the state for damages equal to three (3) times the cost of removal, in addition to disgorgement of any profit and gains or benefit derived from the violation and any other applicable fees, costs, or damages. The owner of the land on which the outdoor advertising device is located shall not be presumed to be the owner of the outdoor advertising device simply because it is on the owner's property.

       The commissioner is authorized and directed to enter into agreements with the secretary of transportation of the United States regarding the definition of unzoned industrial and commercial areas; and regarding the size, lighting, and spacing of outdoor advertising devices that may be erected and maintained within six hundred sixty feet (660') of the nearest edge of the right-of-way within the areas adjacent to the interstate and primary systems that are zoned industrial or commercial under the authority of state or local law, or in unzoned industrial or commercial areas that may be permitted in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the commissioner and the secretary of transportation of the United States. In any agreement entered into with the secretary of transportation, the commissioner reserves the right to renegotiate or make whatever modifications are necessary to conform to any subsequent amendments to the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965, compiled in 23 U.S.C. §§ 131, 136, and 319. Any modification of the agreement with the United States department of transportation that the commissioner signed on or about November 11, 1971, or any subsequent agreement becomes effective only upon passage of an act authorizing the modification by the general assembly.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c21s54-21-113ol1b">
       The commissioner is authorized to execute a modification of the agreement signed on or about November 11, 1971, to change the maximum area for any one (1) outdoor advertising device from one thousand two hundred square feet (1,200 sq. ft.) to seven hundred seventy-five square feet (775 sq. ft.); to reduce the optional maximum square footage of outdoor advertising devices authorized in counties having a population greater than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) from three thousand square feet (3,000 sq. ft.) to one thousand two hundred square feet (1,200 sq. ft.); to modify the agreement to change the minimum spacing of outdoor advertising devices on the interstate system and controlled access highways on the primary system from five hundred feet (500') to one thousand feet (1,000') where the same are not separated by buildings or other obstructions, so that only one (1) outdoor advertising device is visible from the highway at any one (1) time; to change the minimum spacing on noncontrolled access highways on the primary system outside the corporate limits of a municipality from three hundred feet (300') to five hundred feet (500'); and to change the minimum distance from an interchange, or intersection at grade, on the interstate system or controlled access highways on the primary system, outside incorporated cities, from five hundred feet (500') to one thousand feet (1,000'). Inside the corporate limits of a municipality, the distance between signs remains one hundred feet (100'). Permits issued prior to any change authorized for outdoor advertising devices or for outdoor advertising devices subsequently erected pursuant to the permit, that meet size, lighting, spacing, and zoning criteria are unaffected.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c21s54-21-113ol1c">
       The commissioner is further authorized to change the definition of an unzoned commercial or industrial area to provide that only those areas on which there is located one (1) or more permanent structures within which a commercial or an industrial business is actively conducted, and that are equipped with all customary utilities facilities and open to the public regularly or regularly used by employees of the business as their principal work station, or that, due to the nature of the business, are equipped, staffed, and accessible to the public as is customary, may be so defined.

         The commissioner is authorized to execute a modification of the agreement signed on or about November 11, 1971, to change the minimum distance from an interchange, or intersection, at grade, on the interstate system or controlled access highway on the primary system, outside incorporated cities, to five hundred feet (500') when the interchange or intersection is within two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of an interchange or intersection, at grade, of a welcome station. This distance may be measured from that side of the interstate or controlled access highway on which the outdoor advertising is to be located if a determination is made by the commissioner that there exists a geographical feature or foliage in the median of the highway that would substantially block visibility of such outdoor advertising device from any lane of highway on the opposite side of the median.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c21s54-21-113ol1d2">
         If the commissioner is formally notified by the appropriate federal offices of the United States department of transportation that as a result of any provision of this subsection (d), the state will lose federal funds or if a loss of federal funds occurs, then the provision is void and inoperative.

        <li id="t54c21s54-21-113ol1d3">
         If this subsection (d) is found to be void and inoperative, or if notice is received from the United States department of transportation as provided in subdivision (d)(2), then any outdoor advertising device placed pursuant to this subsection (d) must be removed immediately by and at the expense of the owner. Failure to remove the outdoor advertising device renders the sign a public nuisance and § 54-21-105 applies. Nothing in this subsection (d) grants an absolute right in the placement of an outdoor advertising device or makes the state in any way liable under this subsection (d), if this subsection (d) is found in violation of any federal regulations as provided in subdivision (d)(2).

Vegetation control permits will be issued upon payment of a fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150) per face for supervision of the work. All fees received by the commissioner under this section shall be deposited to the highway fund for the administration of this part. Each subsequent year a maintenance permit may be purchased for fifty dollars ($50.00) to provide annual maintenance at any one (1) location that is consistent with the original vegetation control permit.

If the application is incomplete or defective on its face, the commissioner shall notify an applicant in writing no later than fifteen (15) days of receipt of the filed application of its incomplete or defective status, and indicate the information or documentation that is needed to complete or correct the application. If a decision to approve or deny the application cannot be made within thirty (30) days after receipt of the completed or corrected application, the commissioner shall contact the applicant prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) days to provide an explanation of the reasons why additional time is needed to process the application. If the application is approved, the applicant shall notify the commissioner of the date on which the applicant wishes the permit to be issued.

      Wherever the state proposes to improve a section of an existing two-lane undivided public road, the width of the right-of-way of which cannot be ascertained totally or partially by instruments of conveyance, court orders or otherwise, there shall be a presumption that the unascertained width is twenty-five feet (25') on either side of the centerline of the traveled portion of the road.
