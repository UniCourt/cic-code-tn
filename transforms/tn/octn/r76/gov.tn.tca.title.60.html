       Any person who files with the board an application requesting a determination by the board of whether natural gas produced from a well qualifies for a requested status under § 102, 103, 107 or 108 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, Public Law No. 95-621, 92 Stat. 3350 (including any act of congress which amends or supersedes those sections of that act) which determination the board is authorized to make under § 503 of that act, shall pay a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to the state treasurer through the supervisor at the time such application is filed. A separate fee shall be paid for each such application. All funds paid to the state treasurer pursuant to this section shall be disbursed by the state treasurer upon warrants drawn by the commissioner of finance and administration to defray expenses incurred in acting upon such Natural Gas Policy Act determinations.

Upon appeal to the board by a party, or upon passage of a motion of the board to review the administrative judge's initial order, the board shall afford each party an opportunity to present briefs, shall review the record and allow each party an opportunity to present oral argument. If appealed to the board, the review of the administrative judge's initial order shall be limited to the record, but shall be de novo with no presumption of correctness. In such appeals, the board shall thereafter render a final order, in accordance with § 4-5-314, affirming, modifying, remanding, or vacating the supervisor's citation or assessment of a penalty. A final order rendered pursuant to this section is effective upon its entry, except as provided in § 4-5-320(b) unless a later effective date shall be stated therein. A petition to stay the effective date of a final order may be filed under § 4-5-316. A petition for reconsideration of a final order may be filed pursuant to § 4-5-317. Judicial review of a final order may be sought by filing a petition for review in accordance with § 4-5-322. An order of an administrative judge that becomes final in the absence of an appeal or review by the board shall be deemed to be a decision of the board in that case for purposes of the standard of review by a court; provided, however, that in other matters before the board, it may be considered but shall not be binding on the board.

In making such assessment, the board shall give due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the business of the operator charged, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the operator, and the operator's history of previous violations.

In addition, the citation shall fix a reasonable time for abatement of the violation. If the issuing supervisor has reason to believe that such violation, or the failure to abate such violation, should result in the assessment of a penalty under subsections (c)-(e), the citation may so state.

The period of correction may be suspended or lengthened by the assessing party upon a showing by the operator of a good faith effort to comply with the correction requirements and that failure to comply with the correction requirements is due to factors beyond the operator's reasonable control.

The court shall grant the injunction without the necessity of showing a lack of adequate remedy at law upon a showing by the supervisor that such person is violating or is about to violate or has violated one (1) or more of the permanent or temporary injunctions, prohibitory or mandatory, and restraining orders.

The order made by the supervisor in such cases shall be prima facie reasonable and valid, and it shall be presumed that the supervisor has complied with all requirements of the law. The board may likewise bring suit for enforcement of any order made by it, which has become final either by failure of any person to appeal the board's order or by an appellate court's decision against any person who fails to comply with such final order. In such suits, the board's decision shall not be subject to challenge as to matters of law or fact, but the violator may proffer evidence showing that the violator has in fact complied with the board's order.

Such proceedings shall not be tried by jury.
