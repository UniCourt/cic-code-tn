        It is the principle of the common law that every court has the inherent power to enforce its decrees and judgments, which must necessarily involve such convenient legal means as will effectuate the end. Arnold v. Jones, 77 Tenn. 545, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1882).

        A liberal construction of this section would fairly include the setting aside of homestead in ejectment by reserving the homestead, to be subsequently assigned, in the judgment of recovery. Arnold v. Jones, 77 Tenn. 545, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1882).

        If the execution is so defective as not to identify the court from which it issues, or the suit in which it issues, it is void. Trotter v. Nelson, 31 Tenn. 7, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1851).

        Execution in the name of the firm, where the warrant and judgment were in the name of the individual members thereof, on a note payable to the firm, is valid, and it cannot be superseded upon that ground. Gunn v. Benson, Hunt & Co., 13 Tenn. 220, 13 Tenn. 221, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 144 (1833).

        A judgment on a sale note in favor of the clerk and master and special commissioner in a specified cause and execution in favor of the complainants in that cause, omitting the name of the clerk and master, will not invalidate a sale made thereunder, though the execution might be quashable for such irregularity.

        An execution issues, as a matter of course, upon a judgment at law or decree in chancery for a specific sum of money, without any order awarding or directing its issuance in express terms. The judgment or decree is in and of itself an award of execution. The execution issues, without express direction, even for balance due after sale of land under foreclosure, where the decree directing the sale reserves the right to render a decree enforcing any balance.

        The substituted purchaser has a claim against the estate which he may file in an insolvent proceeding to sell lands to pay debts, and receive his pro rata. The judgment proves itself, and should be allowed without further proof. The burden is upon the heirs to show that the estate is not liable. Vallentine v.

   Setting aside satisfaction does not restore parties to rights under original levy. The language of the Code does not allow such construction. Both §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c05s26-5-114" target="_self">26-5-114</a></cite> and this section provide for setting aside the satisfaction and reviving the original judgment or decree, but not any previous execution or levy; and nothing can be revived, except what the statute expressly allows. Moreover, a revivor cannot be allowed to affect the rights acquired while the judgment was extinct. The fact that the purchaser was also the plaintiff in the execution makes no difference, if he is not repelled from court by his conduct. Mays v. Wherry, 3 Tenn. Ch. 80 (1875).

        Where the sale was made without the statutory notice of 20 days to the tenant in possession, or where the judgment debtor had no leviable interest in the land sold, or where the levy itself is void upon its face, a preliminary suit, to test the title to property properly sold, would be an idle and useless form.

        An execution on a judgment rendered at a special term, and issuing before the next regular term, must be tested as of the first day of such special term, and not as of the first day of the preceding regular term. Schaller & Gerke v. Wickersham, 47 Tenn. 376, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1870).

       <p>
        An execution is a lien upon all leviable property of the defendant from the date of its teste and avoids all intervening sales or assignments. John Weis, Inc. v. Reed, 22 Tenn. App. 90, 118 S.W.2d 677, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 9 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).

       <p>
        A judgment creditor's execution lien on the debtor's automobile arose on the date the clerk and master issued a writ of execution. Keep Fresh Filters v. Reguli, 888 S.W.2d 437, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 503 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994).

       </h4>
       <p>
        Lien of execution by relation to its teste does not attach to subsequently acquired property, as where the bankrupt purchased property within 60 days of the petition, the property passed to the trustee freed from the execution lien, because it cannot relate to its teste more than four months before the filing of the petition, so as to attach to property not then owned by the bankrupt.

       <p>
        A growing crop is not subject to execution lien and levy prior to the 15th of November, and the lien of the execution will not relate to its teste, so as to overreach or defeat a prior bona fide sale of the growing crop by the owner before the same is leviable. Edwards v. Thompson, 85 Tenn. 720, 4 S.W. 913, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 15, 4 Am. St. Rep. 807 (1887); Cecil v. Carson, 86 Tenn. 139, 5 S.W. 532, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1887).

         The purpose of this section was to relieve from the delay on issuing executions in the supreme court and in the court of appeals, and not to extend the time for taking the case from the court of appeals to the supreme court on account of a petition filed for the finding of additional facts.

         An execution cannot properly issue before the time fixed by statute, without an order of court; but, nothing appearing in the record to the contrary, it will be presumed that a proper case was made out, and that the execution was regularly issued by authority of the court. Esselman v. Wells & Ewing, 27 Tenn. 482, 1847 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1847); Clark v. Bond, 66 Tenn. 288, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 126 (1874); Miller, Stewart & Co. v. O'Bannon, 72 Tenn. 398, 1880 Tenn.

        <p>
         An execution prematurely issued within the time allowed for an appeal from a court of record, or by a justice (now general sessions court) within the time allowed to appeal or stay the justice's judgment, upon an insufficient affidavit, is merely irregular and not void, but valid until set aside, and no one, not even a garnishee, can take advantage of the irregularity, except the judgment debtor, nor even he collaterally, but only by certiorari and supersedeas, or by some other direct way. Stanley v. Nelson & Dickinson, 23 Tenn. 484, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1844); Carpenter, Ross & Lockett v. Mechanics Sav. Bank, 69 Tenn. 202, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1878); Miller, Stewart & Co. v.

        <p>
         An affidavit by the judgment creditor that “if execution was not issued instanter the debt would be lost” is insufficient to warrant the justice (now general sessions court) in issuing execution before the expiration of two days from the date of the judgment.

   A constitutional provision or statute of a state, creating exemptions or increasing the amount of property which shall be exempt, is, as to the debts previously contracted, or judgments previously rendered, unconstitutional, because in violation of the U.S. Const., art. I, § 10; and such provision is also unconstitutional because in violation of the Tenn. Const., art. I, § 20. Deatherage v. Walker, 58 Tenn. 45, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 225 (1872); Dickinson v.

   The exemption laws are for the benefit of the residents of this state only, and not for nonresidents.

        Where some of the items of an account were contracted before the exemption law became operative, and some were contracted after that date, and judgment is taken in one action on the consolidated account as a whole, the execution issued on such judgment cannot be legally levied on the exempt property. Bachman v. Crawford, 22 Tenn. 213, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 71 (1842).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where property was not exempt when obligation was incurred, exemption which allowed by statute at time of execution was not available for debtor, since creditor cannot be deprived of reaching this property. Hair v. Ramsey, 165 Tenn. 149, 53 S.W.2d 381, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exemption laws, in effect when the obligation was created and not those in effect when execution issues, determine what personal property is exempt. Saunders v. Moore, 21 Tenn. App. 375, 110 S.W.2d 1046, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 40 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an indebtedness was created and judgment obtained during the time a $750 personal property exemption was in effect but execution was not issued until after the time that the amount of the exemption was reduced to $450, the debtor was only entitled to an exemption of $450. Majors v. Carter, 175 Tenn. 450, 135 S.W.2d 924, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        An exemption which exists by statute may be reduced or withdrawn by a later statute. Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Morris, 25 Tenn. App. 272, 156 S.W.2d 350, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 105 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a note was executed on November 20, 1937, but garnishment was issued on August 6, 1940, the exemption act of 1939 governs the exemptions and determines what property of the debtor is exempt from execution. Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Morris, 25 Tenn. App. 272, 156 S.W.2d 350, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 105 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).

       <p>
        Questions of exemptions are to be determined solely by the laws of the forum, thus suit on a note executed in Georgia which waived exemptions could not be relied on in Tennessee, since in Tennessee a stipulation in a note waiving the right of exemption is void as against public policy. Sherwin-Williams Co. v. Morris, 25 Tenn. App. 272, 156 S.W.2d 350, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 105 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).

        By adding the words “debtor's equity interest,” the general assembly made no change in the law as to exemptions in mortgaged personal property. In re Farris, 8 B.R. 186, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5131 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a divorce decree left a bankruptcy debtor with a right to one-half the equity in real property, the debtor's interest was converted from real property to personal property, and she was entitled to an exemption subject to the $4,000 [now $10.000] limit of this section.

       <p>
        “Value,” as used in this section, should be given the same meaning as “fair market value” in § 522(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; this can be stated as the price which a willing seller under no compulsion to sell and a willing buyer under no compulsion to buy would agree to after the property has been exposed to the market for a reasonable amount of time. In re Sumerell, 194 B.R. 818, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 407 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining “value” under this section, there is no deduction for the transaction costs of a hypothetical sale of exempted property, since the debtors actually keep the property exempted under this section and there is no sale.

   The state may circumvent the federal avoidance statute by excluding encumbered property from the state's list of exemptions, may specify the type of property interest which qualifies for the exemption and not just specify particular items of property and their amounts, and creditor in Chapter 7 case was entitled to retain nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest in debtor's household goods.

   The general assembly denominated the tools of trade exemption of §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-111ol14" target="_self">26-2-111(4)</a></cite> as an “additional exemption” to be used in conjunction with and as a supplement to the $4,000 [now $10.000] personal property exemption provided by this section; the language of the two sections contains no indication of mutual exclusivity and no such interpretation should be provided by judicial gloss. Under the Tennessee exemptions, debtors may effectively exempt up to $4,750 [now $11,900] in “tools of the trade” if they elect to forego exemptions in other personal property.

        Employee's age-discrimination claim became the property of her bankruptcy estate when she filed for bankruptcy four days after it accrued, and it did not amount to exempt property that could pass to her through bankruptcy; the employee did not list the claim among the exemptions in her petition, and even if she had, a $500,000 claim was too large for a debtor to retain.

   Bankruptcy court rejected a creditor's argument that a nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest in a big-screen television could not be avoided because such a television was a “luxury” item, because “luxury” was not mentioned as a factor limiting the exemptions for household goods under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(f)</cite>(1)(B)(i); this fact was supported by the television's low value of $450, and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-103" target="_self">26-2-103</a></cite> exempts personal property valued at less than $4,000 [now $10.000].

   Debtors could not exempt more than one-half the value of jointly owned personal property and were required to amend their Schedule C to provide for an equal, one-half division of all jointly owned entireties personal property to the maximum $4,000 [now $10.000] in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-103" target="_self">26-2-103</a></cite>.

        Where debtor breached a contract for sale before his petition date, his sole right in the defaulted contract as of the commencement of his Chapter 7 case was possessory. He could not claim a personal property exemption under Tennessee law in the amount that the trustee received from the sellers for trustee's abandonment of any interest that the estate had in the contract, as debtor's possessory interest was not a personal property interest but was a real property right.

        While debtor and her husband were engaged in exemption planning, husband's transfer of half of proceeds of real property sale into his wife's account was not done with intent to defraud creditors; therefore, Trustee did not show that funds debtor wife sought to claim as exempt under Tennessee law were fraudulently obtained and subject to turnover.

        Even though exempt under state law, a tax refund was not exempt from distribution to creditors under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan where the debtor made no argument that the amount was necessary for the debtor's maintenance or support and where she had agreed that all tax refunds would go to the plan to repay creditors.

        Bankruptcy debtors who were spouses were each entitled to exempt one half of a tax refund, even though one spouse had no tax withheld from minimal earnings, since the debtors intermingled their income, deductions, exemptions, credits, and taxes and held the refund as tenants by the entireties, which refund was thus equally divided between them.

        While debtor was entitled to exempt $8,340 in annuity payments resulting from settlement of personal injury lawsuit, debtor was not entitled to additional exemptions for actual bodily injury, wrongful death, or lost earnings as those were not encompassed in settlement; thus, Trustee could sell annuity payments above debtor's exemption amount because sale did not alter debtor's right to receive payments of her exemption amount in full, and proposed sale met standards for nonordinary course sales.

        This section's requirement that the wearing apparel, which may include jewelry, be for the actual use of the debtor implies that it must at least be in the debtor's possession; thus debtor's diamond ring, which had been lost, did not qualify for this exemption.

        Criteria to be considered in determining whether particular jewelry is “necessary and proper” wearing apparel include: (1) the nature of the items, i.e., are they commonly worn articles such as rings, earrings, bracelets, watches and necklaces; (2) how often are they worn by the debtor; (3) what occasions, if any, dictate the wearing of the jewelry; and (4) value.

        Where debtor testified that she no longer wore the costume jewelry and engagement ring given to her by her former husband, they could not be deemed “necessary and proper” wearing apparel. In re Hazelhurst, 228 B.R. 199, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 1692 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1998).

Therefore, each section stands independent of the other. In re Martin, 102 B.R. 639, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 1049 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1989).

   Bankruptcy court disallowed a Chapter 7 debtor's claim that $61,646 he had in an individual retirement account (“IRA”) was exempt from creditors'  claims under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-105ol1b" target="_self">26-2-105(b)</a></cite> and <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(b)</cite>(3)(C). Although the debtor offered a letter the Internal Revenue Service issued pursuant to I.R.C. § 7805 before he declared bankruptcy, which stated that his IRA satisfied the requirements of I.R.C. § 408(a), the Chapter 7 trustee rebutted the presumption set forth in <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(b)</cite>(4)(A) that the debtor's IRA was exempt from creditors'  claims by showing that the debtor engaged in a prohibited transaction under I.R.C. § 4975(c)(1)(B) when he gave a broker who held the funds in his IRA a lien on all of his accounts.

   Where debtor, above the age of 59 1/2, used money from his IRA for interim funding for the purchase of a house before the home mortgage was put in place and deposited money back into the IRA within 60 days, the transactions did not destroy the exempt status of the IRA under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-111ol11D" target="_self">26-2-111(1)(D)</a></cite> and §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-105ol1b" target="_self">26-2-105(b)</a></cite> because the 60-day rollover rule was not dependent on how the money was used in the interim and did not require that the exact same funds went back into the IRA when the rollover occurred.

   Even if an existing writ of garnishment is deducting the maximum amount, a later-filed writ would run concurrently with the first writ as long as the second writ seeks to deduct an amount that is less than the maximum allowable amount.  Accordingly, the second writ would run concurrently with the first writ, but the second writ would generate no payments to the judgment creditor as long as the first writ remains in effect because the first writ is deducting the maximum amount allowable.  Similarly, if an existing writ of garnishment is deducting less than the maximum amount allowable, a later-filed writ would run concurrently with the existing writ as long as the second writ seeks to deduct an amount that is less than the maximum allowable amount. The second writ could generate only up to the difference between the maximum allowable amount and the first writ.  For instance, if Tenn. Code Ann. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-106ol1a" target="_self">26-2-106(a)</a></cite> establishes the maximum allowable amount that may be garnished from a particular judgment debtor’s disposable earnings at 25% and the first writ is garnishing 15% of the debtor’s disposable earnings, the second writ could garnish only 10%. Once the first writ of garnishment is satisfied or expires, though, the second writ adjusts upward, as long as the amount being garnished does not exceed 25%.  Adjusting the second writ of garnishment upward does not alter when the six-month time period prescribed in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-214" target="_self">26-2-214</a></cite> begins. The lien created by the second writ would begin at the time of its service. OAG 19-10, 2019 Tenn. AG LEXIS 12 (7/3/2019).

   This “opt-out” statute prohibits Tennessee citizens from choosing the exemptions enumerated in <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(d)</cite>. Consequently, in Tennessee, the exemptions available to a debtor in bankruptcy are those prescribed by state law and those nonsection 522(d) exemptions allowable under federal law.

   Since the state “opt-out” statute (this section), on its face, declares that only the exemptions specified in <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(d)</cite> are superseded, this state exemption law cannot and should not be interpreted as an attempt to deny Tennessee residents the benefits of <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(f)</cite> which provides for the avoidance of nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security liens; the clear intent of the Tennessee legislature was to supersede only the specific monetary limits provided in § 522(d). American Bank &amp; Trust v. Miller, 30 B.R. 819 (M.D. Tenn. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   The state may circumvent the federal avoidance statute by excluding encumbered property from the state's list of exemptions, may specify the type of property interest which qualifies for the exemption and not just specify particular items of property and their amounts, and creditor in chapter 7 case was entitled to retain nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest in debtor's household goods.

       </p>
       <p>
        In holding this section valid and as successfully opting out of federal exemption scheme, the decision was applied to pending cases where objections had been raised, as well as future cases, because the change in decision was not unforeseeable, it enabled debtors to receive the benefits the legislature intended them to get, and there was no substantial hardship because the objections to the exemptions election were timely, and the debtors exemption election never finalized.

        While Employee Retirement Income Security Act-required anti-alienation clauses may preempt state law and preclude the use of judgment enforcement devices provided thereunder, they do not preclude inclusion of pension benefits in a debtor's bankruptcy estate of operation of federal law. In re Ridenour, 45 B.R. 72, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4617 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1984), overruled, In re Leamon, 121 B.R. 974, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2611 (Bankr. E.D.

   Because Tennessee opted out of the federal exemptions, under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-112" target="_self">26-2-112</a></cite>, the terms of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-111ol11D" target="_self">26-2-111(1)(D)</a></cite> were controlling as to whether debtor's deferred compensation plan could be exempted from his bankruptcy estate. As the plan allowed accelerated payments, it was not exempt. In re Lawless, — B.R. —, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 3345 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. July 20, 2012), aff'd, Lawless v.

         Tennessee law provides a ten thousand dollar ($10,000) personal property exemption from execution or seizure to satisfy a judgment. If a judgment should be entered against you in this action and you wish to claim property as exempt, you must file a written list, under oath, of the items you wish to claim as exempt with the clerk of the court. The list may be filed at any time and may be changed by you thereafter as necessary; however, unless it is filed before the judgment becomes final, it will not be effective as to any execution or garnishment issued prior to the filing of the list. Certain items are automatically exempt by law and do not need to be listed; these include items of necessary wearing apparel for yourself and your family, and trunks or other receptacles necessary to contain such apparel, family portraits, the family Bible, and school books. Should any of these items be seized, you would have the right to recover them. If you do not understand this exemption right or how to exercise it, you may wish to seek the counsel of a lawyer.

Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Jenkins, 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 203 (1910) (decisions under prior law).

         The legislature's revision of the garnishment statutes, which redefined “property, debts, and effects” to include judgments before all Tennessee courts, rather than merely judgments before (former) justice of the peace courts, did not change the common law rule that clerks of court are exempt from garnishment.

         The Tennessee garnishment statute must be viewed as creating a supplementary action. Overman v. Overman, 412 F. Supp. 411, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16480 (E.D. Tenn. 1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         A garnishment proceeding in a federal removal case must be viewed as a supplemental and not independent civil action since it is an ancillary proceeding based on a valid, unsatisfied judgment and execution. Overman v. Overman, 412 F. Supp. 411, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16480 (E.D. Tenn. 1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Original judgment constituted an ordinary personal money judgment in favor of the father against the daughter in the amount of $ 193,000, with no prohibition against garnishment or other means of execution or enforcement of the judgment, and therefore the father could enforce the original judgment by garnishment or any other means allowed by law.

         Garnishment is purely a statutory proceeding and is in derogation of the common law. General Truck Sales, Inc. v. Simmons, 208 Tenn. 51, 343 S.W.2d 884, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 393 (1961).

         Sole purpose of this section was to refer to those types of contract actions which are garnishable under state law, and had no application when read in light of actions based in tort.

         Rights to change maturity dates of annuity policies or to change the designated beneficiaries under the death benefit provisions, while they may be property, were not property in the possession of the issuers of the policies and therefore could not be reached by writs of garnishment directed at the issuers.

        <p>
         Although the issuers of annuity policies had an existing obligation to the issuee to make payments to him according to the terms of the annuities should he live until their dates of maturity, this obligation, whether it was characterized as a debt or as a chose in action, was not subject to garnishment because it is contingent on a future event — the issuee's survival until the dates of maturity. If he should die before the contracts mature, the issuers will never be indebted to the issuee in any amount. Overman v. Overman, 570 S.W.2d 857, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 637 (Tenn. 1978).

         The general assembly's revision of the garnishment statutes, which redefined “property, debts, and effects” to include judgments before all Tennessee courts, rather than merely judgments before (former) justice of the peace courts did not change the common law rule that clerks of court are exempt from garnishment.

         The process of garnishment is a means to be resorted to for sequestering and appropriating the effects of a debtor, where property liable to execution, sufficient to satisfy the execution, cannot be found. It is a process additional to an execution, different from an execution, for, if the same thing, the execution alone would serve the purpose. English v. King, 57 Tenn. 666, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 285 (1873).
        </p>
        <p>
         As a condition precedent to garnishment on a judgment, an execution must have issued on the judgment. General Truck Sales, Inc. v. Simmons, 208 Tenn. 51, 343 S.W.2d 884, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 393 (1961).

         The service of notice of garnishment does not have the retroactive effect of fixing a lien upon the effects of the judgment debtor, in the hands of the garnishee, from the teste of the execution. Therefore, an attachment, levied upon such effects, has priority over a garnishment subsequently served under an execution, although the teste of the execution antedated the levy of the attachment.

         A garnishee has a right to file his bill of discovery against a plaintiff in an action at law and compel him to say whether his judgment against the debtor has not been satisfied in whole or in part, and to use the answer so obtained as evidence in the motion against himself.

        <p>
         The right of a party to hold a garnishee liable to answer depends upon the existence in his favor of an unsatisfied judgment against his debtor, for, if it be satisfied, or if the debtor have property out of which it may be satisfied, he has no right to summon a garnishee.

   Home Owners Loan Corporation is a governmental agency immune from the provisions of this section with reference to garnishment as the act creating such agency discloses neither an express or implied intention to subject such agency to garnishment and since such agency has no property subject to execution, attachment or garnishment for the reason that all its funds are in custody of and under control of the treasurer of the United States so that process could not reach them.

        <p>
         Under this section the garnishment is in the nature of a sequestration of the judgment debtor, and not a distinct suit. It is an incidental proceeding in the main or original cause. It must be based on a valid, subsisting, unsatisfied judgment and execution against the judgment debtor. Rowland v. Quarles, 20 Tenn. App. 470, 100 S.W.2d 991, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct.

         Where an insurance company was garnishee and notice of garnishment was not served on it but service was accepted by the insurance commissioner, it was not effective to impound the intangible right under a policy, there being no manucaption or seizure of the policy or its proceeds. Fidelity Phenix Fire Ins. Co. v. Ford & Cantrell, 164 Tenn. 107, 46 S.W.2d 64, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1932), rehearing denied, 164 Tenn. 107, 47 S.W.2d 558 (1932).

        <p>
         Though exemption of emoluments of municipal employees from garnishment on grounds of public policy may be invoked by either the employer or the employee and may not be waived by either, a creditor may reach a judgment against a municipality for fees due a former employee, where the municipality elects to submit to garnishment.

         Although the justice's judgment against garnishee did not purport to be conditional and was incomplete and uncertain as respects the party against whom rendered, the defects were waived where garnishee appeared and took part in hearing on the merits without questioning its form. Rowland v. Quarles, 20 Tenn. App. 470, 100 S.W.2d 991, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

         The service of notice of garnishment does not have the retroactive effect of fixing a lien upon the effects of the judgment debtor, in the hands of the garnishee, from the teste of the execution. Therefore, an attachment, levied upon such effects, has priority over a garnishment subsequently served under an execution, although the teste of the execution antedated the levy of the attachment.

         The answer of the garnishee should be clearly ascertained, and his approval of it distinctly shown, and it should be reduced to writing, and signed by him, as the most satisfactory mode of attesting his approval. When this is done, he is bound by it; but when this is not done, and the justice (now general sessions court) renders the judgment upon a mere verbal statement, the garnishee is not precluded from disputing the facts recited in the justice's judgment, upon appeal or certiorari and supersedeas from the justice.

If the answer is not full, or is otherwise imperfect, it may be amended, upon interrogatories which the court will compel the garnishee to answer. Moore v. Green, 23 Tenn. 299, 1843 Tenn.

         Where the garnishee was a corporation of which the judgment defendant was an officer, and the garnishee claimed that such defendant owed it the amount of a demand note introduced, it was incumbent on the garnishee to show why its check, equivalent to the amount of the note and claimed to be consideration therefor, bore the endorsement of its cashier after being endorsed by defendant.

If this be defective or evasive, the plaintiff has the right to a public examination of the garnishee, who should then be called into court for that purpose. Foster v.

         “Sum in controversy” is the amount of alleged debt owed by garnishee and not the amount of judgment held by garnisher. Rucker v. Aymett, 186 Tenn. 672, 212 S.W.2d 659, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 597 (1948).
        </p>
        <p>
         In construing the words “sum in controversy,” we must consider that the statute never contemplated allowing a judgment creditor to litigate with a garnishee as to the amount of his debt to the judgment debtor where he admits in his answer that he owes in excess of $1,000. On the other hand, where the garnishee by his answer admits owing less than $1,000, the trial court, at the instance of the garnisher, will not be precluded from making a full investigation of the claim on the ground that the judgment to be satisfied is in excess of $1,000.

         To authorize a judgment against the garnishee, his indebtedness must clearly appear in so many words, or from admitted facts which show his liability as a legal consequence. If the answer does not contain admissions sufficient to charge him, the garnishee must be discharged; and if the garnishee answers that he does not know whether he is indebted or not, or if his answer is not sufficiently specific to charge him, he must be discharged.

         It is the duty of the garnishee to state, in his answer, every fact within his knowledge, which destroyed the relation of debtor and creditor, previously existing between him and the defendant. If he fail to disclose a fact which would have prevented a judgment against him, he cannot afterwards set up that judgment in bar of a recovery on the debt he owed the defendant, and which he knew had passed into the hands of a third person, before he answered as garnishee.

         In a suit by a bank, owning and forwarding a draft for collection, for the failure of defendant collecting bank to remit proceeds, payment of such proceeds to another, by defendant as garnishee in proceedings to which the complainant was not a party, could not be justified on the ground that the complainant was estopped because defendant notified complainant of the garnishment proceedings and asked for advice as to what defense should be made, and received no response, where the defendant failed to make a complete answer to the garnishment proceedings, as by showing that the draft had been sent to it directly by complainant, and was, on its face, payable to the complainant.

         The obvious purpose underlying this section is to induce satisfaction of garnishments by threatening potentially recalcitrant employers with a penalty in excess of the amount of the garnishment. Young v. Young, 547 F. Supp. 1, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10074 (W.D. Tenn. 1980), superseded by statute as stated in, Jacobson v. United States, 422 N.J. Super. 561, 2011 N.J. Super.

        <p>
         The only pre-condition under this section to entry of a final judgment against a garnishee is the garnishee's failure to answer the garnishment and appear at the show cause hearing. NCNB Nat'l Bank v. Thrailkill, 856 S.W.2d 150, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 106 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that the garnishee may not owe any money to or hold any property of the judgment debtor is irrelevant to entry of a final judgment under this section. NCNB Nat'l Bank v. Thrailkill, 856 S.W.2d 150, 1993 Tenn. App. LEXIS 106 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993).

The conditional judgment remedy is clearly intended to be a “wake-up call” to the garnishee; however, if the garnishee files an answer before the conditional judgment is imposed, this obviates the need for such a “wake-up call.” Smith v. Smith, 165 S.W.3d 285, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 105 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 761 (Tenn. Sept. 7, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Conditional judgment against a garnishee was properly vacated because the garnishee responded within the time allowed by a trial court's order, even though that time exceeded ten days. Smith v. Smith, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 59 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2019).

   Even if an existing writ of garnishment is deducting the maximum amount, a later-filed writ would run concurrently with the first writ as long as the second writ seeks to deduct an amount that is less than the maximum allowable amount.  Accordingly, the second writ would run concurrently with the first writ, but the second writ would generate no payments to the judgment creditor as long as the first writ remains in effect because the first writ is deducting the maximum amount allowable.  Similarly, if an existing writ of garnishment is deducting less than the maximum amount allowable, a later-filed writ would run concurrently with the existing writ as long as the second writ seeks to deduct an amount that is less than the maximum allowable amount. The second writ could generate only up to the difference between the maximum allowable amount and the first writ.  For instance, if Tenn. Code Ann. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-106ol1a" target="_self">26-2-106(a)</a></cite> establishes the maximum allowable amount that may be garnished from a particular judgment debtor’s disposable earnings at 25% and the first writ is garnishing 15% of the debtor’s disposable earnings, the second writ could garnish only 10%. Once the first writ of garnishment is satisfied or expires, though, the second writ adjusts upward, as long as the amount being garnished does not exceed 25%.  Adjusting the second writ of garnishment upward does not alter when the six-month time period prescribed in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-214" target="_self">26-2-214</a></cite> begins. The lien created by the second writ would begin at the time of its service. OAG 19-10, 2019 Tenn. AG LEXIS 12 (7/3/2019).

           After any judgment has been rendered in any court and the time to appeal therefrom has elapsed without such an appeal having been made, the judge of the court which rendered the judgment may, either before or after the issuance and service of garnishment, upon written consent of the parties or upon written motion of the judgment debtor, after due notice and after full hearing of such motion, enter an order requiring such judgment debtor to pay to the clerk of the court a certain sum of money weekly, biweekly or monthly to apply upon such judgment. The filing of such motion by the debtor shall stay the issuance, execution or return of any writ of garnishment against wages or salary due the judgment debtor or any other funds belonging to the judgment debtor sought to be substituted to the satisfaction or payment of or upon such judgment during the period that such judgment debtor complies with the order of the court. Such motion of the judgment debtor shall be supported by an affidavit stating the debtor's inability to pay such debt with funds other than those earned by the debtor as wages or salary, or received from other sources in such amounts as to necessitate or make equitable installment payments, the name and address of the debtor's employer, or other source of funds and amount of such wages or salary, and the date of payment thereof.

           <p>
            NOTICE OF JUDGMENT DEBTOR (AND NOTICE TO GARNISHEE) NOTICE TO THE DEBTOR (EMPLOYEE):  Your earnings have been subjected to a garnishment which has been served upon your employer. The garnishment creates a lien on a portion of your earnings until the judgment is satisfied, or for six (6) months, whichever occurs first. You have the following rights:
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of your wages are protected by state and federal law from garnishment.  See the notice below to the employer to find out how much of your wages are protected from garnishment.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF YOUR EMPLOYER IS TAKING TOO MUCH MONEY FROM YOUR WAGES:
           </p>
           <p>
            You may apply to the court at the clerk's office shown below within twenty (20) days from any improper withholding of your wages for a motion to stop the garnishment. The court clerk identified below shall provide you with a form for making such a motion, or may have supplied a form motion on the back of this notice. You may wish to seek the counsel of a lawyer. If you are unable to afford an attorney, you may be eligible for free legal services to assist you.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLEASE NOTE:  If you file a motion, the court must hear and decide your motion promptly, and in no event later than fourteen (14) days from filing. The clerk will notify you of the time, date, and place of hearing. The court clerk's office can provide you with forms and with information about legal services in your area, but the clerk cannot give you legal advice.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY IS BEING TAKEN FROM YOUR WAGES BUT YOU WANT TO GET THE GARNISHMENT STOPPED THROUGH A PAYMENT PLAN:
           </p>
           <p>
            You may apply to the court for an order suspending further garnishments by the same creditor upon your paying a certain sum of money weekly, biweekly, or monthly, to pay the judgment. If you file this motion, the garnishment of your wages will stop for as long as you make the payments ordered by the court.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court clerk shall provide you with the necessary forms to make this application, or you may seek the counsel of an attorney. If you are unable to afford an attorney, you may be eligible for free legal services to assist you.

            NOTICE TO THE GARNISHEE (EMPLOYER): THE MAXIMUM PART OF THE AGGREGATE DISPOSABLE EARNINGS OF AN INDIVIDUAL FOR ANY WORK WEEK WHICH IS SUBJECTED TO GARNISHMENT MAY NOT EXCEED:
           </p>
           <ol type="A">
            <li id="t26c02s26-2-216ol1b2A">
             Twenty-five percent (25%) of the garnishee's disposable earnings for that week, minus two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) for each of the garnishee's dependent children under sixteen (16) years of age who resides in the state as provided in § 26-2-107; or
            </li>
            <li id="t26c02s26-2-216ol1b2B">
             The amount by which the garnishee's disposable earnings for that week exceed thirty (30) times the federal minimum hourly wage at the time the earnings for any pay period become due and payable, minus two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) for each of the garnishee's dependent children under sixteen (16) years of age who resides in the state, whichever is less.
             <p>
              “Disposable earnings” means that part of the earnings of an individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the case of earnings for a pay period other than a week, the weekly formula must be changed to apply to that pay period so as to exempt an equivalent percentage of disposable earnings. For example, the calculation concerning the federal minimum wage in subsection (b) should be computed as follows: WEEKLY: 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage (fmw) at the time the earnings for any pay period become due and payable; BI-WEEKLY: two (2) times thirty (30) fmw; SEMI-MONTHLY: two and one-sixth (2 1/6) times thirty (30) fmw; and MONTHLY: four and one-third (41/3) times thirty (30) fmw equals the amount to be subtracted from disposable earnings for that pay period.
             </p>
             <p>
              <p>
         If the judgment orders alimony and the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered has remarried, the above exemption applies. If the judgment orders the debtor to pay support for the debtor's minor child or children, or alimony and the person in whose favor the alimony judgment was rendered has not remarried, different standards apply under <cite class="us_code">15 U.S.C. § 1672(b)</cite>. If the debtor is supporting a spouse or dependent child other than those for whom the order was entered, then fifty percent (50%) of the debtor's disposable earnings may be garnished. If the debtor is not supporting such additional dependents, a maximum of sixty percent (60%) may be garnished. These figures rise to fifty-five percent (55%) and sixty-five percent (65%), respectively, if the support order is for a period more than twelve (12) weeks before the pay period to be garnished.
             </p>
             <p>
              <p>
         If the judgment is for state or federal taxes, no disposable earnings are exempt under <cite class="us_code">15 U.S.C. § 1673(b)</cite>.

         In post-judgment proceedings following a final judgment in favor of the city that the property owners pay for unpaid maintenance fees on their commercial real property, the owners'  motion to pay the judgment by installments was properly overruled under the so-called “slow-pay” statute because the owners were less than forthcoming in their affidavit stating their inability to pay the debt; there were clearly other assets available as the owners owned additional real estate; and their failure to disclose their ownership of properties in Ohio and Florida, much less to account for how they maintained such properties, would justify the trial court's decision to deny the “slow pay” motion.

       <p>
        Garnishment of salaries, wages or other compensation due from the state, or from any county or municipality, to any officer or employee thereof, is permissible. Garnishment of compensation due from the state to contractors or vendors of the state is permissible. No such officer, employee, contractor, or vendor may validly claim any privilege or immunity in that regard. Such officer, employee, contractor, or vendor shall be entitled to an exemption of the amount of wages, salary, or compensation so due as is exempt from levy or garnishment in favor of officers, employees, contractors, or vendors of private corporations in like circumstances. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, nothing set forth in this section shall be construed to apply to or to allow garnishments of state compensation to contractors or vendors of the state where the state determines that payment of such garnishment would result in an interruption of essential state services.

The date of service shall be the date upon which service upon the commissioner has been accomplished. If such garnishment is not served as set forth above, such service shall be considered ineffective, and the state shall not be liable for any sums due thereunder. Such commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, is directed to make answer to such garnishment notice or summons, stating the compensation, if any, due any state officer, employee, contractor, or vendor so garnisheed. Such commissioner is directed to withhold any amounts then due the state officer, employee, contractor, or vendor up to and including the amount of the judgment and costs on which the garnishment proceedings were predicated, until the garnishment is released by the issuing court or such funds are paid into that court, as provided by law, and is directed to pay to such officer, employee, contractor, or vendor any amount or sum which may be due such officer, employee, contractor, or vendor above the amount of such judgment and costs, or if applicable, above the amount of each periodic payment made from successive pay periods.

The five dollar ($5.00) fee will be retained from the balance of the judgment debtor's earnings remaining after deducting the payment made to the garnishing court. If the maximum garnishable amount has been reached prior to retaining the five dollar ($5.00) fee, then such amount due shall remain owing to the state until paid.

        <li id="t26c02s26-2-222ol1c">

        <li id="t26c02s26-2-222ol1e">
         After the entry of such conditional judgment a scire facias shall issue to the commissioner of the department in which the garnisheed officer, employee, contractor, or vendor works, returnable to the next term of the court or to a day and place fixed by the court, to show cause why final judgment should not be entered against the state.

In such event, the commissioner is directed to pay any such judgment and deduct the amount thereof from wages, salaries, or other compensation owing to such officer, employee, contractor, or vendor garnisheed under this part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case in which judgment is obtained under this section, if there is no compensation due such officer, employee, contractor, or vendor so garnisheed during the period such garnishment was effective, such judgment against the state shall be void and unenforceable.

Such later filed writ of garnishment shall not begin to run until the earlier filed writ's judgment has been satisfied, such earlier filed writ has expired, or such earlier filed writ has been stayed by installment motion as prescribed in § 26-2-216.

   Attorney General Opinions. Even if an existing writ of garnishment is deducting the maximum amount, a later-filed writ would run concurrently with the first writ as long as the second writ seeks to deduct an amount that is less than the maximum allowable amount.  Accordingly, the second writ would run concurrently with the first writ, but the second writ would generate no payments to the judgment creditor as long as the first writ remains in effect because the first writ is deducting the maximum amount allowable.  Similarly, if an existing writ of garnishment is deducting less than the maximum amount allowable, a later-filed writ would run concurrently with the existing writ as long as the second writ seeks to deduct an amount that is less than the maximum allowable amount. The second writ could generate only up to the difference between the maximum allowable amount and the first writ.  For instance, if Tenn. Code Ann. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-106ol1a" target="_self">26-2-106(a)</a></cite> establishes the maximum allowable amount that may be garnished from a particular judgment debtor’s disposable earnings at 25% and the first writ is garnishing 15% of the debtor’s disposable earnings, the second writ could garnish only 10%. Once the first writ of garnishment is satisfied or expires, though, the second writ adjusts upward, as long as the amount being garnished does not exceed 25%.  Adjusting the second writ of garnishment upward does not alter when the six-month time period prescribed in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-214" target="_self">26-2-214</a></cite> begins. The lien created by the second writ would begin at the time of its service. OAG 19-10, 2019 Tenn. AG LEXIS 12 (7/3/2019).

          The manifest intention of this section was to afford to an individual a $5,000 exemption in his interest in real estate used as his principal place of residence or, alternatively, to afford the individual his proportionate share of a $7,500 exemption where both he and a co-owner (or co-owners) use the real estate as their principal place of residence and assert the exemption in a single proceeding. The logical and relevant inquiry is thus only whether the individual or individuals actually claiming the exemption utilize the property as their principal place of residence.

          Where bankrupt claimed homestead exemption in property held by him and his wife as tenants by the entireties, the result was that the bankruptcy trustee could offer for sale only the bankrupt's survivorship interest in the property and the bankrupt was not entitled to an exemption from the proceeds.

          Under this section and 11 U.S.C. §§ 363(h), 522(b)(2)(B), where each spouse was not in bankruptcy, bankruptcy trustees could sell only the debtors' rights of survivorship in real property owned by each debtor and his spouse as tenants by the entirety because under this section property owned as tenants by the entirety is exempt from process by creditors of an individual spouse.

         <p>
          This section does not in any way preempt a trustee's sale of a debtor's survivorship interest in entireties property. The purpose of the homestead statute is fulfilled through sale of the survivorship interest subject to the debtor's defeasible homestead right. The debtor and his wife may continue to occupy the entireties property during their joint lives. The purchaser at the trustee's sale of the debtor's survivorship interest cannot obtain possession of the entireties property, nor is he entitled to profits or rents during the joint lives of the debtor and his wife. If the debtor predeceases his wife, the purchaser's interest will be extinguished. On the other hand, if the debtor survives his wife, the purchaser will succeed to the fee interest subject to the debtor's homestead right. In re Walls, 45 B.R. 145, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4445 (Bankr.

          When a trustee in bankruptcy is allowed to sell the debtor's right of survivorship in property owned as tenants by the entirety, the debtor is not entitled to recover the dollar amount of the homestead exemption from the proceeds of the sale; however, the better approach is to sell the survivorship interest subject to the debtor's right to a homestead exemption if and when he is the survivor.

          Debtor's survivorship interest in real property, owned as a tenancy by the entirety and claimed as the debtor's residence, passed into the bankruptcy estate; the debtor's present right to use, possession, and enjoyment of the property passed out of the bankruptcy estate because it was exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.

          Debtor who was a tenant by the entirety had a homestead exemption in his survivorship right, which was part of the bankruptcy estate; however, he would not receive the cash value of that exemption from the proceeds of any sale of that survivorship right. Rather, the survivorship right, if sold by the bankruptcy trustee, would have been encumbered by the debtor's homestead exemption and the debtor would have received the cash value of his exemption if and when he survived his spouse.

          Chapter 7 debtor, who owned property as tenants in common for life, with the remainder to the survivor in fee, was entitled to a $ 25,000 homestead exemption since: (1) Tennessee's highest court had held that a joint tenant had a unilateral right to sever a joint tenancy with an express right of survivorship; (2) to the extent that a joint tenant interest was exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law, the debtor's homestead exemption claim was good in bankruptcy; (3) Tennessee allowed levy on the whole interest of one co-tenant of a tenancy in common; and (4) the Tennessee homestead exemption applied to jointly owned property.

          Trustee's objection to the debtor's claimed enhanced homestead exemption was overruled because the debtor was exercising actual physical care of his granddaughter, and had the rights and responsibilities associated with guardianship and custody, which established his custody for purposes of the enhanced exemption.

          Although courts generally agree that a debtor's conversion of nonexempt property into exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy is not fraudulent per se, extrinsic circumstances may indicate the commission of a fraud on the debtor's creditors; thus, where the evidence clearly showed that the debtor, while insolvent and in contemplation of bankruptcy, established a homestead exemption in property, which was then subject to execution, for the express purpose of defeating the rights of creditors, particularly the rights of his ex-wife, her objection to the homestead exemption would be sustained.

   Bankruptcy court held that <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(f)</cite>(2)(A) contains a federal definition of impairment and, in light of its explicit language, prohibits the court from looking to state law to define impairment; thus, the bankruptcy court rejected a creditor's contention that its lien had priority over a later mortgage lien and, thus, should not be avoided as it did not impair the debtors' homestead exemption because <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 522(f)</cite>(2) requires the bankruptcy court to include the mortgage in the impairment analysis.

   Debtors who declared bankruptcy were allowed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522 to avoid a second judgment lien which a creditor placed on their home in full, and a first judgment lien which another creditor placed on their home in part, because both liens impaired a homestead exemption the debtors claimed pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-301" target="_self">26-2-301</a></cite>; the formula that appeared in § 522 for determining whether a judgment lien impaired a debtor's exemption was a relatively simple calculation of value minus the sum of other liens, the exemption, and the judicial lien to be avoided, and when that formula was applied in the debtors'  case, it showed that $841 of the first judgment lien impaired the debtors'  exemption.

          A surety paying the assignee of a purchase money note that originally constituted a vendor's implied or equitable lien cannot be subrogated to such lien, because such assignee had no such lien. He is entitled to subject the homestead to the payment of the purchase money debt, however, and the debtor cannot claim the homestead exemption against such debt, for the homestead is not exempt from sale for the payment of debts contracted for the purchase money of the land. Himes v. Smith, 2 Shan. 431 (1877).
         </p>
         <p>
          The homestead is not exempt from the payment of purchase money, though the evidence of the debt may have been changed in form, and though all the residue of the land has been taken by a creditor against whom the homestead exemption was effective. Bentley v. Jordan, 71 Tenn. 353, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1879).

         </p>
         <p>
          Although the vendor may lose all liens on the land, by an absolute conveyance acknowledging payment in full, and by taking a new note with security and a higher rate of interest, or may otherwise lose it, he may subject the land impressed with the homestead right to the satisfaction of such debt, by virtue of the fact that it was contracted for the purchase money of the land and this, though all the other land has been seized and appropriated by other creditors. Bentley v. Jordan, 71 Tenn. 353, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1879); Byrns v. Woodward, 78 Tenn. 444, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 202 (1882).

   This statute was not intended to alter the then existing law further than to give the head of a family owning land the power to locate his homestead upon any part of it, and to enjoy the homestead exemption without actual occupancy. It was not intended to create a homestead right in undivided interests in land. Flatt v. Mack Stadler Co., 84 Tenn. 371, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1886); J. I. Case Threshing-Machine Co. v.

          Under this section, the head of a family may elect to have the homestead exemption set apart upon any land owned by him; but this power of selection does not add any more absolute character of title in the land covered by the homestead than existed before such right was conferred, nor does it empower the husband to convey the homestead without the joinder of the wife. Flatt v. Mack Stadler Co., 84 Tenn. 371, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1886); Cottrell v. Rogers, 99 Tenn. 488, 42 S.W. 445, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1897).

          The failure of the officer levying upon and selling the land in which the homestead exemption exists to cause the assignment of the homestead to be made before the sale does not deprive the debtor of the homestead right, nor vest in the purchaser any greater right than the officer could sell, even though no demand for such assignment was made by the debtor. The failure of the officer to discharge his duty does not affect the homestead right. Redeeming creditors stand in no better condition than the original purchaser. Gray v.

          The execution sale of land of greater value than the sum allowed and subject to homestead, made without the assignment of homestead therein to the debtor, is voidable at his election, and he is entitled to have the sale vacated and annulled. The statute is so far mandatory as to render the sale made without compliance with the terms of the statute, voidable. However, it is the sale that is voidable and not the levy, if it was valid.

          The circuit court may cause homestead to be assigned in the purchaser's action of ejectment against the debtor, and though it is more regular to set apart the homestead before giving plaintiff final judgment for the residue, the Supreme Court will not reverse the case because the circuit court judge gave the plaintiff judgment for the land, excepting the homestead, which was subsequently assigned. If such case is appealed before the assignment of the homestead, the Supreme Court will reverse the case because no final judgment had been rendered. Arnold v. Jones, 77 Tenn. 545, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1882); Burnett v. Austin, 78 Tenn. 564, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 224 (1882); Galyon v. Gilmore, 93 Tenn. 671, 28 S.W. 301, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1894); Delk v.

          Where the land exceeds in value the amount allowed by statute and the sale under levy of execution was made without the previous assignment of homestead as required by this statute, the homestead may be assigned in the action of ejectment by the purchaser against the debtor who was the owner entitled to the homestead. This was done for the protection of the debtor's homestead right against loss through the dereliction of the sheriff, and in disapproval of his failure to observe the requirement of the statute. Burnett v. Austin, 78 Tenn. 564, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 224 (1882); Delk v. Yelton, 103 Tenn. 476, 53 S.W. 729, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 129 (1899).

          The levy of an execution on lands of less than the statutory allowance, reciting that it is made “subject to the homestead rights” of the debtor, and a sale thereof, without the formal assignment of homestead under this statute, operates as an assignment of homestead that invests the debtor with a life estate therein that he may convey by deed.

Where the proof does not show the extent of the homestead exemption, such claimant will be given the possession of the entire land; but where the proof (especially that of the claimant) shows the probable extent of the homestead exemption, the claimant will be given possession to that extent only.

            NOTICE TO JUDGMENT DEBTORTo collect a judgment against you in this lawsuit, your money or other property has been seized by execution or garnishment. An execution allows the sheriff to sell the property levied upon. A garnishment requires your bank (or other person holding your money or property) to transfer your property to the court or to hold it to satisfy the judgment.
           </p>
           <p>
            READ THIS CAREFULLY. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR MONEY OR PROPERTY OR GET IT BACK.
           </p>
           <p>
            State and federal laws prevent certain types of money or property from being used to pay a judgment. Such money or property is “exempt.” Examples of exempt money are: Social security benefits, SSI, unemployment benefits, Veterans' benefits, AFDC, and most government pensions. Examples of exempt property are certain health care aids and “tools of trade.” These examples of exempt money and property constitute only a partial list, and you may have other exemptions.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you think you have exempt money or property that has been seized, you have the right to file a motion with the court clerk's office identified below claiming your exemption and asking for the release or return of your money or property.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can get a form for filing this motion at the clerk's office below, or the clerk may have supplied such a form on the back of this notice. YOU SHOULD ACT QUICKLY.  If you file a motion within twenty (20) days from the date this notice was mailed to you or was given to you, the court must hear and decide your motion promptly, and in no event later than fourteen (14) days from filing. The clerk will notify you of the time, date, and place of the hearing.

            IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS OR HOW TO EXERCISE THEM, YOU MAY WISH TO CONSULT WITH A LAWYER. IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD A LAWYER, YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE LEGAL ASSISTANCE.  The court clerk's office can provide you with forms and with information about legal services in your area, but the clerk cannot give you legal advice.

       The issuance of an execution does not, at common law, fix a lien upon the debtor's choses in action; but this rule has been changed, in this state, by this section, as against corporations. Smith v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 126 Tenn. 435, 150 S.W. 97, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 45 L.R.A. (n.s.) 266 (1912).

       An execution against a corporation fixes a lien on its choses in action, just as if they were “goods and chattels,” without registration of a memorandum of the judgment. Smith v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 126 Tenn. 435, 150 S.W. 97, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 45 L.R.A. (n.s.) 266 (1912).

       This statute was intended to protect officers from the peril of disputed titles to property supposed to be liable to execution. State v. Sharp, 34 Tenn. 615, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1855).

        2. Scope of Statute.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The statute applies to disputed titles based upon the claims of third parties, and does not extend to cases of objection by the defendant in the execution upon the ground that the judgment or execution is void, or that the property is exempt from execution, and the like. Baker v. Agey, 21 Tenn. 13, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1840); Hunter v. Agee, 24 Tenn. 57, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1844).
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer is entitled to ask indemnity before levy of execution or sale thereunder in all cases where there is a dispute as to the title to the property about to be levied on or sold; as, where personal property has been conveyed by the execution debtor in trust for creditors, after the execution came to the officer's hands, but before levy. Saunders & Martin v. Harris, 23 Tenn. 72, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1843); State v. Sharp, 34 Tenn. 615, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1855).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute is confined to executions, and does not extend to attachments; and an indemnity bond cannot be demanded before levy of an attachment on disputed property, and the officer cannot escape liability upon that ground, where the disputed title was not well founded. The officer is liable for false return of nulla bona, where property attached is released. Shaw v. Holmes, 51 Tenn. 692, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 223 (1871); Grigsby v. Manly, 79 Tenn. 636, 1883 Tenn.

       An order of sale of specific property issued by a court having custody of the property is complete protection to the officer making the sale, and he must execute it, and cannot demand an indemnity bond, though the title to the property is disputed.

       In suit by judgment creditor against constable for failing to levy on property of defendant the officer was entitled to introduce evidence that property belonged to father of defendant since acceptance of bond by officer from plaintiff does not require him to seize property not owned by defendant.

       An officer is not liable for failing or refusing to levy upon disputed property, or for failing or omitting to sell it when levied upon, unless he be indemnified.

       Where a bond of indemnity is given to an officer, and property is pointed out to him, upon which he levies, he is not bound to sell it, but may release it, and return the execution “nulla bona,” and if sued for false return for this, he may show that the property did not belong to the defendant in the execution, and thus escape liability. Hamblet v. Herndon, 22 Tenn. 34, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1842); State v. Sharp, 34 Tenn. 615, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1855).

       Surety or stayor is released by abandonment of levy on land which was sufficient in value to pay the debt, where by the active interference of the creditor, the burden of the debt has been shifted from the property of the principal debtor, after a specific lien was fixed upon it, so as to throw it upon the surety or stayor. Lindsey v. Thompson, 60 Tenn. 463, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 535 (1873); Watson v. Reed, 63 Tenn. 49, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. 1874); Love v. Allison, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 111 (1874); Keeble v.

      </p>
      <p>
       A surety is not released by the actual levy of the execution on the principal debtor's property, if the levy be invalid, or be released for sufficient cause, as that the principal did not own the property or that his title was in dispute.

   Although judgment debtors argued that execution on a car they had purchased was void because it described the car using the wrong vehicle identification number, the appellate court found that a sufficient description of the property levied on, and the date of the levy, appeared on the face of the execution, thereby satisfying the requirements of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c03s26-3-108" target="_self">26-3-108</a></cite>.

      <p>
       To constitute a valid levy on personalty, the officer must see the goods and assert a dominion over them, by seizing and taking control of them, and so interfere with them that if he had not the execution or other right to them, his act would be an actual or constructive trespass. While actual manual seizure is not necessary, the officer must assume dominion and control over the goods, and they must be present or subject to his control, and his possession must be actual or what amounts to the same thing. Etheridge v. Edwards, 31 Tenn. 426, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1852); Brown v. Allen, 40 Tenn. 429, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       A valid levy which will vest the title of personal property in the levying officer does not consist alone in writing out the levy on the process, but the property must in fact be seized or taken control of by the officer. Evans v. Higdon, 60 Tenn. 245, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 481 (1873); Syler v. Denton, 1 Shan. 321 (1874).

      <p>
       The writing of a levy on property under lock and key, seen through a crack, and leaving it, upon the promise of one not having the legal possession thereof to keep it for the officer, is not a sufficient levy as against a subsequent valid levy and seizure. Evans v. Higdon, 60 Tenn. 245, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 481 (1873).

       A levy on bulky articles in a closed cellar, which were seen by the officer through an opening of the cellar door which was fastened, will be good if the article be kept in view by the officer until surrendered by the debtor.

       Where the property of the execution defendant is in the smokehouse of a third person, within the curtilage of his mansion house, a demand for admittance and a refusal are sary before the sheriff can violently break open such house, for the purpose of levying execution upon the property of such defendant.

       A levy of an attachment upon the goods of the debtor is valid and effectual, although the officer effected it in the nighttime, by opening a window or forcing an outer door of a storehouse in which the goods were stored.

       The officer need not, at the moment of the levy, endorse his action on the execution, but it is sufficient if he goes into the presence of the property levied upon, with the power and purpose then and there to seize it, and really assuming control of the property with the knowledge of the execution debtor, noting the fact of the levy upon the execution or a separate paper, and subsequently endorsing it properly on the execution.

       The levying officer's title to personalty levied on is not lost or waived by a second levy under an alias execution, nor by delivery bond on the alias without forfeiture. Evans v. Barnes, 32 Tenn. 292, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1852); Brown v. Allen, 40 Tenn. 429, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personalty levied on by one officer may be levied on by another officer, by and with the consent of the officer making the first levy, who may agree to hold the surplus proceeds for the second execution. Tyler v. Dunton, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 361 (1873); Syler v. Denton, 1 Shan. 321 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an execution is levied upon the defendant's personalty which is taken possession of by the levying officer, the subsequent levy of another execution by another officer will be void, in the absence of any agreement between the first and second levying officers as to the joint possession of the property.

   The levy of an execution upon personal property invests the levying officer with the title thereto, but the levy of an attachment does not divest the debtor of the title to the property, but simply creates a lien upon it.

       Several executions issued upon several judgments rendered against the same defendant, upon different days of the same term of the court, as shown by the record, will, as between the judgment creditors, equally relate to their testes, though the judgments were rendered on different days of the term; and the court will order the same to be paid to the several creditors pro rata. Porter v. Earthman, 12 Tenn. 358, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1833); Longstreet v. Hill, 58 Tenn. 53, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 227 (1872).

       The execution, and not the judgment, creates the lien upon personal property, and the lien is operative from the teste of the execution to its return day, unless sooner returned without levy. Union Bank v. McClung, 28 Tenn. 91, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1848).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien of an execution on the personal property of the execution debtor commences only from its teste, and never extends beyond it, and ends with its return not levied; and, therefore, an alias execution, tested of the term to which the original execution was returnable, does not operate as a lien upon personal property by relation to the date of the judgment, but only to its teste, the return day of the first execution, and it has no priority of satisfaction out of property levied upon, over executions tested of the same term, and issued on judgments recovered at that term. Union Bank v. McClung, 28 Tenn. 91, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1848); Barnes v. Hayes, 31 Tenn. 304, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1851); Edwards v. Thompson, 85 Tenn. 720, 4 S.W. 913, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 15, 4 Am.

      <p>
       If the minutes of the court do not show the time of day at which the court convened, the judgments rendered on that day relate to the first moment thereof, and executions issued thereon, and tested of that term, create liens on the personalty of the execution debtor from that time. Cox v. Hodge, 31 Tenn. 371, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1851).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien of an execution issued upon the judgment of a court of record relates to its teste, and attaches to all personalty owned by the judgment debtor between the teste and the levy of the execution, so as to defeat all intermediate transfers and purchasers, whether the personalty was owned at such teste or was acquired between the teste and levy, though he may have sold the same before the levy was made. Barnes v. Hayes, 31 Tenn. 304, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1851); Mosely v. Baker, 34 Tenn. 362, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1854); Edwards v. Thompson, 85 Tenn. 720, 4 S.W. 913, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 15, 4 Am.

      </p>
      <p>
       The relation of the lien of an execution to its teste, so as to overreach intermediate transfers of personal chattels, is a pure fiction of law that ought not to be indulged further than the courts are bound to go by the well settled law; and such fictions should not be extended so as to work injustice.

       The lien acquired by an execution and levy is stricti juris, and may readily be lost by laches, or release of the property and the giving of time to the defendant by the plaintiff, or by any improper interference on the part of the plaintiff. Porter's Lessee v. Cocke, 7 Tenn. 29, 7 Tenn. 30, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1823); Hickman v. Murfree, 8 Tenn. 26, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1827); Daley v. Perry, 17 Tenn. 442, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1836).

      <p>
       Where an execution creditor had acquired a prior lien on personal property by the levy of an execution tested before that of another execution, and thereafter procured the judgment debtor to convey in trust the property so levied on to secure his debt, which operated to release the levy, the property then became subject to be levied on by a junior execution bearing teste previous to the conveyance. Daley v. Perry, 17 Tenn. 442, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1836); Sandeford v. Hess, 39 Tenn. 680, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 300 (Tenn. Apr. 1859).

       As between executions from the federal and state courts, there is no lien until actual levy and seizure, and the one first levied has priority, for priority of lien depends upon actual seizure under levy, and not upon the testes of the executions, nor the dates of the judgments.

       Lien of execution on personalty relates to its teste, unless the judgment or decree is rendered after the teste, and then the relation is to the date of the rendition of the judgment or decree. An execution issued after the death of a judgment debtor, on a judgment rendered previous thereto, but tested before his death, relates to the teste which is the first day of the term preceding its issuance, and binds his personal property from that date, unless the teste antedates the judgment, and then the lien relates to the date of the judgment. This is so, even if the estate of the deceased judgment debtor is insolvent. Harvey v. Berry, Demobille & Co., 60 Tenn. 252, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 483 (1873); Rocco v. Parczyk, 77 Tenn. 328, 1882 Tenn.

       A levy upon real estate must be sufficiently definite to enable the purchaser to ascertain the nature and value of the property, and to furnish the means of knowing what land is to be sold; and there must be such ascertainment of identity by description, as shall prevent one piece of land from being sold, and another distinct piece conveyed.

       The sale of land based on the levy of a justice's execution is not void upon the ground that it is not stated in the levy or order of sale that the land lies in the county in which the judgment was rendered, where the description is otherwise full and good, and it is stated in the levy that the land lies on a certain named creek.

       The land must be so described in the levy by giving the county and civil district in which it lies, such natural objects, if there be any, as will serve to guide a person to the locality, and the necessary metes and bounds to include the land, or such other description of boundaries as, by reference to other adjoining tracts, will distinguish the tract levied on from any other tract of land owned by the same party in that vicinity, and the name of the owner must be given.

       A levy on “all the defendant's right, title, and interest in the land,” or on “the defendant's undivided interest in the land,” sufficiently describing the land, without stating what his interest is, is sufficient, even to pass his undivided interest in a remainder or reversionary estate in the land, without levying on it and selling it as such, for it passes under the general terms.

       The levy on lands must show their location to a reasonable certainty, and a levy in these words: “Levied on eight thousand acres of land lying in four tracts,” is bad, and a sale under it is void. Pound v. Pullen's Lessee, 11 Tenn. 338, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1832).
      </p>
      <p>
       The levy of an execution in these words: “Levied on lot No. —, in the town of Greenville, with its improvements,” is void for uncertainty, and a sale and deed made by virtue thereof convey no title to the vendee. Brown v. Dickson, 21 Tenn. 395, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1841).
      </p>
      <p>
       A levy upon “all the unsold land of the defendant in a forty thousand acre tract” is entirely too vague, and a sale under it will convey no title. Huddleston v. Garrott, 22 Tenn. 629, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 166 (1842).
      </p>
      <p>
       A return as to description in these words: “Levied on 471 acres of land lying in the fifth district, adjoining the land of C. Cannon, H. M. Thomas and others; levied on as the property of James H. P. Porter, Sr.,” is insufficient in description, though it is otherwise good. Porter v. Fine, 1 Shan. 21 (1848).
      </p>
      <p>
       The levy of an execution in these words: “Levied… on nineteen hundred and fifty acres of land in Henderson County, part of a tract of 2,500 acres located by Daniel Gilchrist,” is void for uncertainty, and a sale thereunder communicated no title to the purchaser. Brigance v. Erwin's Lessee, 31 Tenn. 375, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1852).
      </p>
      <p>
       A levy of an execution in these words: “Levied on three hundred and fifty acres of land, the property of Edmond Collins,” is void for uncertainty. Lafferty v. Conn, 35 Tenn. 221, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1855).
      </p>
      <p>
       Description in levy as follows: “Levied … on one hundred acres of land, the property of Salathiel Riley and Francis Fannin, adjoining lands of Joel W. Jarvis, in fifth district,” is insufficient, and the sheriff's deed upon same is inoperative, and not an assurance of title, or an effective muniment to create a title under the statute of limitations. Riley v. Frost, 2 Shan. 333 (1877).

       The levy of an execution on land in these words: “Levied on the right, title, claim, and interest that John Doak has in and to seventy acres of land lying on the waters of the west fork of Stone's river,” is sufficient, when followed by the sheriff's deed defining its locality with precision. Parker v. Swan, 20 Tenn. 80, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1839); Helms v. Alexander, 29 Tenn. 44, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1849); Riley v. Frost, 2 Shan. 333 (1877); Christian v. Mynatt, 79 Tenn. 615, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       The levy of an execution “on one tract of land adjoining the lands of Jas. McDondel, Thos. Cannon and others, containing one hundred and sixty acres,” is too vague and uncertain, and is not sustained by the sheriff's deed, made by a different person, describing the land by metes and bounds, and as “adjoining the lands of James McDonald and Thomas Cannon,” especially where there was a discrepancy or variance between the location and description of the lands in the levy, notice to defendant, and also in the sheriff's deed which distinguish this case from the other cases. Helms v. Alexander, 29 Tenn. 44, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1849).

       Levy void for uncertainty in description is not helped by reference to a newspaper advertisement which forms no part of the record; as, where a levy on land is made in these words: “Levied this execution on three tracts of land; one tract containing 300 acres, one containing 30 or 40 acres, one other containing 110 acres, as the property of Haywood Cozart, all in the county of Carroll. See advertisement in newspapers for description.” Taylor's Lessee v. Cozart, 23 Tenn. 433, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1844).
      </p>
      <p>
       Levy containing defective description of land may be made valid by reference to an attached advertisement containing a sufficient description which is copied into the return, thus becoming a part of the record; and such return makes good what was deficient in the levy. Gibbs v. Thompson, 26 Tenn. 179, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1846).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the levy refer to a deed or other title paper of record, to which convenient access may be had, it thereby incorporates in itself the description contained in the deed or title paper referred to. Brigance v. Erwin's Lessee, 31 Tenn. 375, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1852).

       The lien fixed by the levy of execution is not destroyed, but merely suspended, by an injunction or supersedeas, or such other adverse proceeding that stops its enforcement, unless the same be made perpetual on the hearing, but upon the dismissal of such injunction or supersedeas the lien of the levy may be enforced. The execution creditor may also have a judgment on the injunction or supersedeas bond, in addition to the lien. Porter's Lessee v. Cocke, 7 Tenn. 29, 7 Tenn. 30, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1823); Overton v.

       Where the purchaser at a sale under condemnation by the circuit court after levy of an execution from a judgment delayed getting a sheriff's deed for over eight years, his delay, unexplained, was a gross negligence, amounting to an abandonment of his lien, and a subsequent purchaser without notice, who recorded his deed, had superior title, though the court purchaser finally took a deed, for such deed did not relate back to the levy.

       Where a lien has been fixed upon land by the levy of an execution or attachment, and the debtor dies before a valid sale, there must be a revivor of the judgment or attachment suit against the personal representative and the exhaustion of personal assets, before the lien can be enforced by a sale of the land; but where there is a judgment lien on the land, it may be enforced after the judgment debtor's death, by an execution bearing teste before his death, though issued and levied on the lands subject to the judgment lien, after such debtor's death. Green v. Shaver, 22 Tenn. 139, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1842); Stockard v. Pinkard, 25 Tenn. 119, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1845); Perkins' Heirs v. Norvell, 25 Tenn. 151, 1845 Tenn.

       A sale of land under an execution issued and tested after the death of the judgment debtor, without revivor, is void, though the judgment is a lien on the land; but a sale of land under an execution issued after, but tested before, the judgment debtor's death, without revivor, is valid.

        Amendment of 1943 to statute permitting judgment creditor to bring suit for discovery of property except property held in trust under trust declared by will duly recorded or deed duly registered which amendment provides the property held under spendthrift trust shall be subject to claims of estate in all cases where state is judgment creditor, is invalid insofar as it is retrospective in character as violating due process clause and as impairing obligation of contracts. State v. Caldwell, 181 Tenn. 74, 178 S.W.2d 624, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 346, <cite class="alr">151 A.L.R. 1410</cite> (1944).
           </p>
           <p>
            Sections 26-4-101, 26-4-102 do not authorize imprisonment for debt, because such imprisonment for defendant's willful and contemptuous disobedience of the lawful orders of the court in refusing to answer, or in refusing to deliver up the property disclosed by his answer, is not imprisonment for debt. Cresswell v. Smith, 76 Tenn. 688, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1881); Caughron v. Stinespring, 132 Tenn. 636, 179 S.W. 152, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 58, L.R.A. (n.s.) 1916C403 (1915).
           </p>
           <p>
            <p>
        The 1943 amendment is invalid insofar as it is retrospective in character, as violating the due process provisions of the Constitution and the provisions of U.S. Const., art. 1, § 10 prohibiting the enactment of statutes impairing the obligations of contracts. State v. Caldwell, 181 Tenn. 74, 178 S.W.2d 624, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 346, <cite class="alr">151 A.L.R. 1410</cite> (1944).
           </p>
           <p>
            <p>
        The beneficiary of a spendthrift trust who acquired title and interest in such property prior to the 1943 amendment took a vested estate under a rule of property which was beyond the reach of the legislature, and such trust property could not be subjected to the claims of the state under the provisions of the amendment. State v. Caldwell, 181 Tenn. 74, 178 S.W.2d 624, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 346, <cite class="alr">151 A.L.R. 1410</cite> (1944).
           </p>
           <p>
            In consequence of the decision in Erwin v. Oldham, 14 Tenn. 185, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1834), that chancery had no inherent jurisdiction, without a statute, in the absence of fraud or trust, to aid a judgment creditor to reach the debtor's stocks, credits, and rights of action, ch. 4 of this title was enacted. Ewing v. Cantrell, 19 Tenn. 364, 1838 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1838); Graham v. Merrill, 45 Tenn. 622, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1868); Cresswell v. Smith, 76 Tenn. 688, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1881).
           </p>
           <p>
            The chancery court has jurisdiction, upon a bill filed by a complainant whose execution has been returned unsatisfied, to compel a judgment debtor to discover any specific property and to compel him to disclose where the property is, and, by process of attachment for contempt, to compel him to deliver up the property for the satisfaction of the complainant's judgment, and the bill may be filed against the debtor alone. Cresswell v. Smith, 76 Tenn. 688, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1881); Webb v. Jones, 81 Tenn. 200, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1884).
           </p>
           <p>
            This section did not apply in the case of a supplemental complaint filed by a plaintiff asserting new causes of action against defendants other than those against whom he had earlier obtained a final judgment. Williams v. Sugar Cove Ltd. Pshp., 955 S.W.2d 75, 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 301 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997), appeal denied, 1997 Tenn. LEXIS 514 (Tenn. Oct. 27, 1997).

        On grounds of public policy, a municipality not being subject to respond as garnishee, the phrase “any other corporation” was limited to private corporations. Parsons v. McGavock, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 581 (1875). (See however §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c02s26-2-221" target="_self">26-2-221</a></cite>, since enacted.)
           </p>
           <p>
            “Any property,” includes everything that the term implies, and is not limited by the later phrase “due to such defendant or held in trust for him.” Cresswell v. Smith, 76 Tenn. 688, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1881).
           </p>
           <p>
            This section must be construed as taking from the chancery courts all jurisdiction to compel discovery by a debtor of his property not leviable at law in the cases therein excepted from subjection to his debts, but it does not affect the power to compel a discovery in the other cases in the section. Jourolmon v. Massengill, 86 Tenn. 81, 5 S.W. 719, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1887); Porter v. Lee, 88 Tenn. 782, 14 S.W. 218, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1890); McKeldin v.

           <p>
            An execution with a return of no personal property and a levy upon an equity not subject to such levy is an execution “returned unsatisfied,” within the provisions of this section, and justifies the filing of a bill thereunder. House v. Swanson, 54 Tenn. 32, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 412 (1871).

            Where employee gave six weeks' notice of his resignation and was adjudicated a bankrupt three weeks later, sum credited to him in employer's retirement plan did not pass to bankrupt's estate and was not a mere “spendthrift trust” available to creditors under Tennessee law. Tennessee Valley Authority v. Kinzer, 142 F.2d 833, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3523 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1944).

           <p>
            Even though trust was not established by recorded will or registered deed, pension plan was treated as a spendthrift trust excluded from debtor's estate in bankruptcy where the plan was not a self-settled trust created by the debtor but was funded exclusively by contributions from the debtor's employer, the debtor had no right to withdraw funds from the trust other than by meeting the eligibility requirements of one of the four benefit plans enumerated in the plan, the debtor had no control over the corpus of the trust, and the plan contained the requisite anti-alienation and anti-assignment provisions. In re Stansberry, 101 B.R. 508, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 948 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1989), overruled, In re Leamon, 121 B.R. 974, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2611 (Bankr. E.D.

            <p>
        Debtor's motion for summary judgment was granted, because the bankruptcy trustee's assertion that the distribution that the debtor received in a spendthrift trust pursuant to his mother's will was property of the bankruptcy estate was in error, because the debtor had no immediate right to payment of any portion of the trust corpus; therefore, the distribution was not the property of the bankruptcy estate under <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 541</cite> and not subject to turnover pursuant to <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 542</cite>.

           <p>
            Where no discovery is sought or needed, a bill by a judgment creditor, with execution returned nulla bona, will not lie in chancery to reach an asset or debt which was leviable at law, where no obstacle or impediment was in the way of the enforcement of an execution by garnishment, and there was no lien, fraud, trust, nor equitable interest in the property. Bryan v. Zarecor, 112 Tenn. 503, 81 S.W. 1252, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1904); Jennings Neff & Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., 128 Tenn. 231, 159 S.W. 1088, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 43, 47 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1058 (1913).

            Trustee of bankrupt to whom homestead had never been assigned was entitled to file a bill in chancery for an assignment of homestead rather than by filing bill for discovery of assets, if a bill to compel discovery of homestead was not necessary. Edwards v. Hawks, 189 Tenn. 17, 222 S.W.2d 28, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 396 (1949).

           <p>
            It is not necessary to the maintenance of a creditor's suit to establish a lien on the debtor's interest in funds paid into court that it should be made to appear that an execution had been issued and returned “nulla bona,” if it is shown that the judgment debtor is really insolvent and has no property subject to execution, and if the question is not raised by motion to dismiss, demurrer, or plea in abatement. Scott County Nat'l Bank v. Robinson, 143 Tenn. 356, 226 S.W. 218, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1920).

        According to the plain language of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c01s26-1-104" target="_self">26-1-104</a></cite>, case law, and contents of a creditor's petition, the petition established a lien sufficient to sustain the ensuing proceedings, as there was no priority dispute with competing creditors, and nor did any interests of bona fide purchasers or encumbrancers exist to mandate greater scrutiny for determining the lien's effectiveness as against them; T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c04s26-4-101" target="_self">26-4-101</a></cite> conferred subject matter jurisdiction over the action upon the trial court which correctly denied the debtor's motion to dismiss the suit on this basis.

           <p>
            A fund due to a corporation which sold all of its property to another corporation, which fund has been thus assigned to the purchaser, was not subject to levy or attachment in an action at law against the seller, and hence a bill in equity against the seller and purchaser could be maintained by a judgment creditor of the seller to reach such fund. Jennings Neff & Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., 128 Tenn. 231, 159 S.W. 1088, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 43, 47 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1058 (1913).

            The trustee and beneficiaries in a spendthrift trust cannot, by mutual agreement, terminate the trust and defeat the purpose of the donor to give to the beneficiaries a support which shall be free from the claims of creditors. Vines v. Vines, 143 Tenn. 517, 226 S.W. 1039, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1920).
           </p>
           <p>
            To create a spendthrift trust, language specially exempting the interest of the beneficiary from the claims of his creditors is not necessary. White v. O'Bryan, 148 Tenn. 18, 251 S.W. 785, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1922).
           </p>

            The creator of the trust may give to beneficiary a vested equitable interest and yet prevent his anticipation or alienation of that interest. Tramell v. Tramell, 162 Tenn. 1, 32 S.W.2d 1025, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1930), modified and rehearing denied, 162 Tenn. 1, 35 S.W.2d 574 (1931).

           <p>
            When an active trust is created by some person other than the beneficiary and is declared by will duly recorded or deed duly registered, court of chancery has no power to subject the interest of the beneficiary. Mayberry v. Redmond, 169 Tenn. 190, 83 S.W.2d 897, 1935 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1935).

            Where a testator by his will sought to provide trusts for his children during their lives, which constituted “spendthrift trust,” the corpus of such trust cannot be subject to the debt of the cestui que trust so long as the latter lives, but they may be after his death. Patton v. Winters, 20 Tenn. App. 600, 101 S.W.2d 708, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
           </p>
           <p>
            While the Supreme Court is fully committed to the “spendthrift trust” doctrine, such doctrine will not be extended to apply when the instrument fails to create a “trust” in unmistakable terms and to provide for a trustee. Sternberger v. Glenn, 175 Tenn. 644, 137 S.W.2d 269, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1940).

            A spendthrift trust is valid in Tennessee. Davis v. Mitchell, 27 Tenn. App. 182, 178 S.W.2d 889, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).

        Since the Supreme Court of the United States in Nichol v. Levy, <cite class="us_code">72 U.S. 433</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">18 L. Ed. 596</cite>, 1866 U.S. LEXIS 949 (1867), held that the Act of 1832 was a “rule of property,” it follows that where the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust acquired a title and interest in property such title and interest must necessarily be adjudged a vested estate and beyond the reach of the legislature. State v. Caldwell, 181 Tenn. 74, 178 S.W.2d 624, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 346, <cite class="alr">151 A.L.R. 1410</cite> (1944).

           <p>
            The exceptions to general principle of liability of a person's property for his debts created by the statutes of exemptions are for protection of debtor as distinguished from exception created under doctrine of spendthrift trust which is in consideration of right of donor or settlor to dispose of his property and control his bounty as he wishes within limits allowed by law. State v. Nashville Trust Co., 28 Tenn. App. 388, 190 S.W.2d 785, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 79 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).
           </p>
           <p>
            A spendthrift trust must be an active one, declared by will or deed duly recorded, and created by, or the property must have proceeded from, some person other than the beneficiary himself; such a record being notice to the public, prevents the beneficiary from misleading creditors, or obtaining false credit upon his apparent ownership of the trust property, and thus the real reason for sustaining such a trust is that, as the property comes from another, it takes nothing from the beneficiary's creditors. State v. Nashville Trust Co., 28 Tenn. App. 388, 190 S.W.2d 785, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 79 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).

            Tennessee law allows true spendthrift trusts only under this section. In re Elsea, 47 B.R. 142, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6643 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1985); In re Faulkner, 79 B.R. 362, 1987 Bankr.

           </p>
           <p>
            The whole trust must be in “unmistakable terms”; notice to creditors is not separate from the creation of the trust. Baskin v. Commerce Union Bank, 715 S.W.2d 350, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2997 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1986).

            Beneficiary of spendthrift trust must be limited to a right to receive income. In re Faulkner, 79 B.R. 362, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1758 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1987), overruled, In re Leamon, 121 B.R. 974, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2611 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1990), overruled on other grounds, In re Leamon, 121 B.R. 974, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2611 (Bankr. E.D.

            Debtor's pension plan held not to qualify as a spendthrift trust where anti-alienation and anti-assignment provisions were qualified by the debtor's right to apply for a loan from the trust fund. In re Faulkner, 79 B.R. 362, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1758 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1987), overruled, In re Leamon, 121 B.R. 974, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2611 (Bankr. E.D.

            An unregistered decree, creating an active trust and vesting and divesting title accordingly is not equivalent to a registered deed, and is ineffectual as against the creditors. White v. O'Bryan, 148 Tenn. 18, 251 S.W. 785, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1922).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where the trustee is required to convey under certain circumstances, and therefore to preserve the remainder for that purpose, he must take and retain legal title to the land, so that the beneficiary takes no interest in or title to the land subject to levy under execution, or that can be subjected by proceedings in equity to payment of his debts. Henson v. Wright, 88 Tenn. 501, 12 S.W. 1035, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 71 (1890).

           <p>
            Where the testator devised two tracts of land to his executor in trust, with directions that the same were not to be sold for ten years, and that out of the net rents the executor was to pay to two sisters such sum per month for their support, as in his judgment he considered necessary, not to exceed $100 per month to each, the sisters took no vested interest in the estate, but would become vested with such funds only as the trustee, in his discretion, saw proper to pay them. Vines v. Vines, 143 Tenn. 517, 226 S.W. 1039, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1920).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where testator's father created a trust at his death in which the beneficiaries, including the testator, would receive only the income from the corpus, it was a spendthrift trust; however by prior court construction the trust ended on the death of the beneficiaries and by will they could devise their share of the corpus, hence at testator's death his share was part of his estate and was subject to debts created during his lifetime. Patton v. Winters, 20 Tenn. App. 600, 101 S.W.2d 708, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
           </p>
           <p>
            A direct devise of a life estate in land containing provisions restricting the devisee from selling, transferring, pledging or encumbering the land or any income therefrom did not operate to create a “spendthrift trust” so as to bring such interest into the exception provided by this section but merely vested legal title in the devisee by direct devise. Sternberger v. Glenn, 175 Tenn. 644, 137 S.W.2d 269, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1940).
           </p>
           <p>
            Neither statute nor usual provisions creating a strictly spendthrift trust will prevent the immediate vesting of an equitable, transmissible estate in beneficiaries of the trust unless a contrary intention is manifested by the language of the will. Davis v. Mitchell, 27 Tenn. App. 182, 178 S.W.2d 889, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
           </p>
           <p>
            Restrictions creating a pure spendthrift trust — that is, mere restraints upon alienation and anticipation, do not necessarily operate to prevent the vesting of an equitable estate in fee in the beneficiaries, whereas the contrary may be true of restrictions strictly limiting the use of the income or corpus to support, or vesting trustee with a discretion as to its application to the appointed purpose. Davis v. Mitchell, 27 Tenn. App. 182, 178 S.W.2d 889, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).

           <p>
            Where the legal title to land or personalty is vested in a trustee, by deed or will, to be held during the life of a third person, to whom the net annual profits or rents for that duration are to be paid, and at his death he is authorized to dispose of it, or the same is to be conveyed by the trustee to other persons, an active trust is created, and the beneficiary for life takes no interest or title to the land or personalty subject to levy under execution, or that can be subjected by proceedings in equity to the payment of his debts, the deed being duly registered or the will being duly recorded. This is so as to the land or personalty, though there are no express provisions excluding creditors. The net annual profits or rents cannot be subjected in the hands of the trustee to the payment of the debts of the beneficiary, especially where the rights of creditors are excluded. Hooberry v. Harding, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 677 (1878); Jourolmon v. Massengill, 86 Tenn. 81, 5 S.W. 719, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1887); Henson v. Wright, 88 Tenn. 501, 12 S.W. 1035, 1889 Tenn.

            The rule applies only in case of an active trust, where the estates of the trustees and beneficiary are distinct and not subject to merger, for otherwise it does not fall within the terms of the statute, and upon the merger in the beneficiary the land may be levied on at law.

            Chancery courts have no power or jurisdiction to compel discovery of a debtor's property of an equitable nature, and to subject the same to his debts at the suit of his judgment creditor with a return of nulla bona, where the property is held in active trust for the debtor, created by some third person, and “declared by will duly recorded or deed duly registered.” Porter v. Lee, 88 Tenn. 782, 14 S.W. 218, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1890); White v. O'Bryan, 148 Tenn. 18, 251 S.W. 785, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1922); Tramell v. Tramell, 162 Tenn. 1, 32 S.W.2d 1025, 1930 Tenn.

            A will provided that the legal title of the interest given to a son should be vested in another son as trustee under a trust similar to that under which the trustee held the estate given to a certain daughter, and the clause vesting the daughter's interest provided that the trustee shall hold it for her use and benefit and pay to her the rents, incomes, and profits therefrom, without power in the daughter to anticipate or assign her portion of the rents, incomes, and profits; but same should be paid to her by the trustee during her natural life; and it was held that the intention of the testatrix was to incorporate, in the clause vesting the property in the son, the applicable terms of the trust created for the daughter, and created an active trust for the son. White v. O'Bryan, 148 Tenn. 18, 251 S.W. 785, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1922).
           </p>
           <p>
            The mere fact that the corpus of a trust is to be preserved for the possible benefit of contingent remaindermen is sufficient to create an active trust. White v. O'Bryan, 148 Tenn. 18, 251 S.W. 785, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1922).

            It is a fundamental predicate for the application of the exception provided by this section that there shall be a trust and that the trust shall be active. Sternberger v. Glenn, 175 Tenn. 644, 137 S.W.2d 269, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1940).

            An active trust can be created wherein the beneficiary takes no transmissible equitable interest in the estate and none in the income until it is paid to him. Davis v. Mitchell, 27 Tenn. App. 182, 178 S.W.2d 889, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
           </p>
           <p>
            By virtue of this section an active trust within the purview of this section takes on the characteristics and immunities appertaining to a spendthrift trust, as that phrase is commonly understood, quite apart from any restrictions or lack of them in the instrument creating the trust, insofar as the rights of creditors are concerned, but neither the statute, nor the usual provisions creating a strictly spendthrift trust where present, will prevent the immediate vesting of an equitable, transmissible estate in the beneficiaries of the trust unless the language of the will expressly or impliedly manifests a contrary intention on the part of the testator. Davis v. Mitchell, 27 Tenn. App. 182, 178 S.W.2d 889, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
           </p>
           <p>
            Will and codicil providing a trust for testator's children and grandchildren, with provisions protecting income and principal from their creditors, did not create a “spendthrift trust,” but rather a trust for support of beneficiaries where circumstances indicated that beneficiaries were not in need of such protection, and where creditors at the time of testator's death as well as time of execution of will, were otherwise barred from claiming the beneficiaries' interest. Davis v. Mitchell, 27 Tenn. App. 182, 178 S.W.2d 889, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 139 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides this section's express requirements, the courts have added the requirement that a spendthrift trust must be an “active” rather than a “dry” trust, which basically means that the property must be under the control of the trustee rather than the debtor-beneficiary. In re Elsea, 47 B.R. 142, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6643 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1985); In re Faulkner, 79 B.R. 362, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1758 (Bankr. E.D.

            A trust enabling owner to enjoy the income exempt from his debts cannot be created by a grantor, he being the only beneficiary, either by a direct exemption of the property from his future debts, or indirectly, by leaving it discretionary with the trustee to allow him benefits from the property; and a deed creating a trust for the benefit of the grantor is void, upon its face, as to his creditors who may subject the land by bill in chancery, without other proof of fraud. Jourolmon v. Massengill, 86 Tenn. 81, 5 S.W. 719, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1887); J. S. Menken Co. v. Brinkley, 94 Tenn. 721, 31 S.W. 92, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1895); Citizens' Nat'l Bank v.

           <p>
            An attempt by a person to put his own property into a trust for his own benefit beyond reach of his creditors cannot be sustained as a valid spendthrift trust, since it is violative of general principle that one's property is liable for his debts and is violative of law of fraudulent conveyances. State v. Nashville Trust Co., 28 Tenn. App. 388, 190 S.W.2d 785, 1944 Tenn. App. LEXIS 79 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1944).

            Where son, with knowledge that father intended to place real estate in spendthrift trust for son's benefit, placed mansion and other substantial improvements on land and where, after state had recovered judgment against son, father placed the improved property in such spendthrift trust, state, as judgment creditor regardless of son's actual intent, could subject property to judgment to extent that it was enhanced by contributions of son.

            The clerk and master of the chancery court is the mere instrument to distribute a fund paid into court, in accordance with the court's orders, and is therefore neither a necessary nor a proper party to a creditor's suit to subject the interest of the judgment debtor in such fund to the payment of the creditor's claim.

            In a suit to compel the discovery of all securities owned by the estate of the deceased and all securities of which his wife claimed to be the owner the mere statement of the wife that the securities were bought with her money could not be taken as true where her answer went on to show that she didn't know what she was talking about and where the record taken as a whole showed that she didn't have the money with which the securities were purchased.

            Return of nulla bona in the county where the judgment was rendered is sufficient to sustain a bill in any other county to subject the equitable interest in realty or personalty to the payment of the judgment. Embree v. Reeve, 25 Tenn. 37, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1845); Riddle v. Motley, 69 Tenn. 468, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1878).

            The return of nulla bona has never been held to be the only evidence of the fact shown by such return. It has in fact been treated as a form, only material because it is made, by statute, sufficient evidence to sustain a bill. Turley v. Taylor, 71 Tenn. 171, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1879).

      <p>
       The court was inclined to believe that the levy of an execution upon personal property of one of several defendants in a judgment, and the taking of a delivery bond with security from such defendant, which was forfeited, would not operate as a satisfaction of the judgment, or discharge from liability such of the defendants as might not have joined in the delivery bond; but if it were otherwise, remedy at law by quashing the execution was available.

       Where a surety pays a judgment of foreclosure against his principal, he thereby discharges the lien of such judgment and opens the way for the rights of third parties purchasing or loaning money thereon to intervene, and he cannot assert the lien of the judgment by way of subrogation against a bona fide purchaser of the property from the principal after entry of satisfaction of the judgment.

      Upon forfeiture of the bond, the officer holding the execution shall levy immediately upon the property of the defendants who join in the bond, to satisfy the debt and costs to the plaintiffs and double costs to the officer; and if there shall not be property enough of these defendants found to satisfy the execution, such officer shall levy upon property of the sureties sufficient to satisfy so much of the amount as they had become liable for; and if the execution is still unsatisfied, it shall be the officer's duty to go upon such of the original defendants, if any, as did not join in the delivery bond.

       Where the original bill was insufficient in description of the property to fix a lien thereon from its filing, an amendment supplying the defects would only fix the lien from its date, not as of the date of the filing of the original bill. In order to reach and fix lien upon book accounts and choses in action, notice to the debtors is not required. However, no lien is established by a description so general as “all book accounts, bills receivable.” Boorum & Peas Co. v. Armstrong, 37 S.W. 1095, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 55 (1896).
      </p>

       The idea of reaching certain specific property to be described in the bill runs through all sections of this chapter. There should be a more specific description, as by stating the names of the debtors or some other mode; this in justice to the other creditors as well as the debtor sued. Boorum & Peas Co. v.

       A creditor's bill is sufficient in its description of a chose in action (fee of attorney in a chancery suit) where it alleges the suit wherein a decree had been rendered allowing the chose, such fee payable out of the recovery, and that an account be taken to ascertain the amount due the defendant attorney and that it be subject to the judgment upon which nulla bona was based.

   According to the plain language of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c01s26-1-104" target="_self">26-1-104</a></cite>, case law, and contents of a creditor's petition, the petition established a lien sufficient to sustain the ensuing proceedings, as there was no priority dispute with competing creditors, and nor did any interests of bona fide purchasers or encumbrancers exist to mandate greater scrutiny for determining the lien's effectiveness as against them; T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t26c04s26-4-101" target="_self">26-4-101</a></cite> conferred subject matter jurisdiction over the action upon the trial court which correctly denied the debtor's motion to dismiss the suit on this basis.

       Where the judgment has not been registered, and the interest of the judgment debtor in the property sought to be reached is equitable, the complainant acquires no lien, except from the filing of the bill. Flannegan v. Stifel, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 464 (1877).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien is created by the filing of the bill, with description of the land, and statement for relief, upon service of process upon the debtor, even before service of process upon his mortgage creditors. Harris v. Beasley, 123 Tenn. 605, 133 S.W. 1110, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1911), superseded by statute as stated in, Figlio v. Shelley Ford, Inc., — S.W.2d —, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 425 (Tenn. Ct.

       The lien attaches to property fraudulently conveyed upon the filing of a bill to set aside the conveyance. It is the filing of the bill that gives the lien. Bank of Delrose v. Mansfield, 4 Tenn. App. 488, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 199 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).

      <p>
       A judgment creditor, with execution returned nulla bona, may, without the consent of the mortgagee, foreclose the matured mortgage of his debtor by a sale of the property under a chancery decree, and reach the surplus. Fulghum v. Cotton, 74 Tenn. 590, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 300 (1880); Bridges v. Cooper, 98 Tenn. 381, 39 S.W. 720, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 232 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment creditor acquires a lien upon his debtor's equity of redemption in mortgaged lands from the date of his filing a bill to foreclose the mortgage, and subject the equity to the payment of his debts; and this lien expands to embrace and subject to sale any enlargement of the debtor's interest to the extent of the entire fee resulting from payment in part or full discharge of the mortgage debt made pending the suit. Bridges v. Cooper, 98 Tenn. 381, 39 S.W. 720, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 232 (1897); Schoolfield v. Cogdell, 120 Tenn. 618, 113 S.W. 375, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1908); King v.

       A judgment creditor, with a nulla bona return, by filing a bill to foreclose the matured mortgage or deed of trust of his debtor to another, acquires a lien, and is entitled to the surplus, if any.

      <p>
       A creditor cannot, under ch. 4 of this title, by filing a bill against an insolvent corporation, not using its franchises, acquire such a lien upon the assets of the corporation as will entitle him to full satisfaction of his demand, to the prejudice of other creditors; but the assets of such corporation remain, as before the above statute, according to the general doctrine of equity, impressed with the character of a pledge or trust for the benefit of all creditors, and in which all are entitled to share ratably, notwithstanding the superior diligence of some. But if the corporation is solvent, its creditor may file his bill in equity against it, to secure his debt, and to compel a discovery. Marr v. Bank of West Tennessee, 44 Tenn. 471, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 71 (1867); Voightman & Co. v. Southern R. Co., 123 Tenn. 452, 131 S.W. 982, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1910).

       The filing of a bill to appropriate specific property to satisfy a judgment, after return of nulla bona, fixes a lien or charge on the property, which is not affected or displaced by an adjudication in bankruptcy within four months after the filing of the bill. The bankruptcy, under such law, only dissolved attachments on mesne process. House v. Swanson, 54 Tenn. 32, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 412 (1871); Cowan, McClung & Co. v. Dunn, 69 Tenn. 68, 1878 Tenn.

       When a judgment creditor, with a nulla bona return, has filed a bill for foreclosure and to reach the surplus by a sale of the debtor's land encumbered with a mortgage trust, the trustee can sell the land, after such judgment creditor has taken a second mortgage trust on the land, by which said suit was to stand continued for some six months and until the date fixed for the foreclosure of the second mortgage, with a provision that if the first mortgage trust was foreclosed by sale before that date, then that the second mortgage trust should be foreclosed, and that such judgment creditor should receive the surplus, especially where there was no injunction.

       The officer having charge of the execution must serve the notice personally on the defendant, if this can be done, but if not, the notice may be left at his residence in proper hands. White v. Chestnut's Lessee, 30 Tenn. 79, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1850); Richards v. Meeks, 30 Tenn. 455, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the notice be left at the debtor's residence, it should be left with some member of the family; or, if this cannot be done, it should be placed in some conspicuous place in or about the house, so as to attract attention on his return. White v. Chestnut's Lessee, 30 Tenn. 79, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       Posting the notice on the front door of the shop used by the debtor, on the lots sold, is not sufficient, though its contents were known by the debtor 20 days before the day of sale. Richards v. Meeks, 30 Tenn. 455, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaving notice with a tenant residing on the land, or “with a Mrs. Griffin, a woman with whom said Collins (the defendant) had been living as I (the officer) was informed,” is not sufficient. Lafferty v. Conn, 35 Tenn. 221, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1855).

      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff's parol testimony in explanation of his return, but not in contradiction thereof, is admissible to show that notice was given to the defendant in actual possession of land sold by him, where the return stated that the advertisement and notice had been waived, which he explained, by his testimony, had reference alone to newspaper advertisement and notice by posters of the sale.

       The recital of the fact of service of notice according to law, made in the sheriff's return or deed, is prima facie evidence that the required notice was given, but this presumption is subject to rebuttal by parol or aliunde evidence; but the burden of proof is on the party denying that the notice was given to show that it was not given. Rogers v. Jennings' Lessee, 11 Tenn. 307, 11 Tenn. 308, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1832); Loyd v. Anglin's Lessee, 15 Tenn. 427, 15 Tenn. 428, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1835); Mitchell v.

      <p>
       Marshal's recitation of notice in return and deed is not sustained by his deputy's mere statement, not a written official return endorsed, that the written notice was given to the defendant. Elliot v. Schultz, 29 Tenn. 234, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1849).
      </p>
      <p>
       A recital in the sheriff's return that he sold the land, after giving “due notice by written advertisement, as required by law,” does not import that he had given the required notice to the execution debtor in actual possession of the land. Downing v. Stephens, 60 Tenn. 454, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 532 (1873); Sheafer v. Mitchell, 109 Tenn. 181, 71 S.W. 86, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there be no recital of notice in the sheriff's return or deed, notice will not be presumed, and the purchaser must show by proof that, in the particular case, notice was not necessary or not required by law. Downing v. Stephens, 60 Tenn. 454, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 532 (1873).

       Before the enactment of this statute, and independent of it, a purchaser was entitled to credit for taxes discharged by him, either before or after the confirmation of the report of sale, where the land was not sold subject to the charge of taxes, or where the purchaser did not understand that he was to take the land subject to such burden.

       Taxes accruing between the date of a chancery sale and its confirmation must be paid out of the proceeds of the property sold, and not by the purchaser; and this is true though the purchaser's notes bear the date of the sale, for the day of the sale is the day when the sale becomes complete and effective by confirmation.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Recital in a sheriff's deed of land sold by him that he “legally advertised and made known” the time and place of sale is prima facie evidence of the advertising and giving the required notice to the judgment debtor in possession of the land. Rogers v. Jennings' Lessee, 11 Tenn. 307, 11 Tenn. 308, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1832); Loyd v. Anglin's Lessee, 15 Tenn. 427, 15 Tenn. 428, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1835); Simmons v. McKissick, 25 Tenn. 259, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1845); York & Robinson v. Byars, 131 Tenn. 38, 173 S.W. 435, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff's deed must recite everything necessary to make a valid title, and if it fails to recite the existence of a judgment, execution, and levy, it is fatally defective. It will not be sufficient to show, by parol or record proof, that in fact there was a judgment, execution, and levy, for their existence must be recited in the deed. Byers v. Wheatley, 62 Tenn. 160, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 158 (1873); Lemons v. Wilson, 65 Tenn. 143, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 324 (1884); Harlan v. Harlan, 82 Tenn. 107, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1884); Hyder v. Butler, 103 Tenn. 289, 52 S.W. 876, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the judgment, execution and levy are produced, they must correspond with the recitals of the deed. A material variance between the recitals in the sheriff's deed and the record will be fatal, and cannot be cured by proof. Byers v. Wheatley, 62 Tenn. 160, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 158 (1873); Lemons v. Wilson, 65 Tenn. 143, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 324 (1884); Harlan v. Harlan, 82 Tenn. 107, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1884); Hyder v. Butler, 103 Tenn. 289, 52 S.W. 876, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1899).

      <p>
       If there is any variance between the recitals of the deed and those of the return made after the sale, and forming no part of the levy, the deed prevails. The return of the sale is not necessary to a deraignment of the purchaser's title, is immaterial as evidence of title, and may be averred against, and its recitals in relation to the character of the title conveyed are not evidence. Stinson's Lessee v. Russell, 2 Tenn. 40, 1809 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1809); Mitchell v. Lipe, 16 Tenn. 179, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1835); Rogers' Lessee v. Cawood, 31 Tenn. 142, 1851 Tenn.

   The mere lapse of time does not affect the validity of the sheriff's deed made by any subsequent sheriff; and the sheriff's deed made 34 years after the execution sale of land was held to be valid. Reeve v. North Carolina Land &amp; Timber Co., 141 F. 821, 1905 U.S. App. LEXIS 4050 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1905), cert. denied, Weinreb v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Lapse of nine years held not to affect validity of deed made by subsequent sheriff, where parties did not plead abandonment or raise such question until after the appeal, and no new rights had arisen. Williams v. Williams, 25 Tenn. App. 290, 156 S.W.2d 363, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).

      <p>
       Purchaser is estopped to deny recitals in sheriff's deed, or to show, by the records, the true facts in contradiction of such recitals; as, where the deed recites that the sale was made under a certain venditioni exponas, it cannot be shown by the records that the sale was made under that venditioni exponas, conjointly with certain executions, where the sale under the executions operated to transfer title to the purchaser, and the sale under such venditioni exponas did not so operate.

       Inaccurate recitation in a sheriff's deed that an execution came to the hands of a certain person as deputy sheriff under a certain sheriff, when he was in fact a deputy under another sheriff, should be construed as a technical error and does not affect the validity of the deed.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A judgment creditor, who has satisfied his judgment by a bid on land, cannot have the satisfaction set aside, and the judgment reinstated, in the absence of fraud, upon the ground that he was disappointed in getting a life estate instead of the fee. Gonce v. McCoy, 101 Tenn. 587, 49 S.W. 754, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 106, 70 Am. St. Rep. 714 (1898).

       It is necessary to allege and show a previous adjudication of plaintiff's want of title under his purchase, in case stated. Swaggerty v. Smith, 48 Tenn. 403, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1870).

      <p>
       The statute embraces all cases where it turns out that the creditor gets nothing by the sale, on account of debtor's title failing, whether the sale is of realty or personalty. Edde v. Cowan, 33 Tenn. 290, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1853).
      </p>
      <p>
       Satisfaction of judgment may be set aside where lands sold had been purchased by the debtor but by his procurement had been conveyed to his children with intent to defeat creditors. Smith v. Hinson, 51 Tenn. 250, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 155 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       The creditor is not entitled to relief merely because he is “of the opinion that he obtained no title to the property sold,” but the fact of the want of title must appear at the trial; and it does so appear, if the defendant permitted a judgment by default to be taken upon the scire facias averring the fact. Hayes v. Cartwright, 74 Tenn. 139, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 220 (1880).

      <p>
       Where judgment creditor purchases the debtor's land under execution or condemnation sale, and learns that the sheriff had failed to serve the judgment debtor with notice of the levy and date and place of sale, as required by statute, he may, by petition, have satisfaction of the judgment set aside.

      <p>
       The pendency of the bill of a creditor to set aside the satisfaction of his judgment by a sale of land, and to subject the same land by the decree, will give the complainant a lien superior to that of a subsequent judgment creditor of the common debtor, although the land may have been previously sold and conveyed under the execution of a third creditor.

       A judgment, when once satisfied by payment or by sale under execution, cannot again be used for any purpose until the satisfaction is set aside, and the original judgment revived by proper proceedings; and a sale of land under an execution issued upon a satisfied judgment is void. Finley v. Gaut, 67 Tenn. 148, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 341 (1874); Gentry v. Wagner, 77 Tenn. 682, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 122 (1882).

       The title of the defendant to the property sold, to be “good and valid” so as to operate as a defense to the scire facias, must be such as to clothe the purchaser with a beneficial interest, not a mere legal title subject to prior liens which exhaust it.

      <p>
       To entitle an officer to be substituted to the rights of the judgment creditor in an execution, two things are necessary, namely, (1) that the officer's liability for the default shall have been fixed by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and (2) that such judgment has been satisfied by him. Lintz v. Thompson, 38 Tenn. 456, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 212 (1858); Beal v. Smithpeter, 65 Tenn. 356, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 364 (1873).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A constable or sheriff, after he has voluntarily paid to the plaintiff the amount of an execution in his hands for collection, cannot hold it up as unsatisfied and enforce the collection of the money upon that execution for his own benefit; especially is this so, where the payment was made without reservation or condition, and without any contract of any sort with the plaintiff. By such payment, the execution became functus officio. Harwell v. Worsham, 21 Tenn. 524, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1841); Lintz v. Thompson, 38 Tenn. 456, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 212 (1858); Burt v.

      </p>
      <p>
       There can be no alias execution after officer's voluntary payment and satisfaction of execution in his hands, because such payment, without any transfer of the judgment and execution to him, is a satisfaction of the judgment, so that he cannot take out an alias execution for his own benefit, and enforce its payment by the original debtor, though he made the payment to avoid a motion against him for his failure to return the execution, within the time required by law. Lintz v. Thompson, 38 Tenn. 456, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 212 (1858); Burt v. Thompson & Warren, 40 Tenn. 534, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1859).

      <p>
       An officer, voluntarily paying the amount of an execution in his hands, cannot sue the original debtor in assumpsit and recover the amount so paid. Burt v. Thompson & Warren, 40 Tenn. 534, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1859).

       Where a judgment by motion has been taken against an officer and his sureties for his failure to make proper return of an execution, such officer is not entitled to substitution to the rights of the execution creditor against the debtor in the original judgment, because he had incurred an original and personal liability, in the nature of a penalty for the nonperformance of his official duty; and especially is this the rule before he has made payment of such judgment. Doyle v. Glenn, 23 Tenn. 309, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1843); Smith v. Van Bebber, 31 Tenn. 110, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1851).

        In a case in which plaintiff recovered a judgment against the Tennessee defendants in a New York court and sought to enroll and enforce the judgment in accordance with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA), the trial court erred in denying defendants'  motion to dismiss the proceeding and deny the New York judgment full faith and credit because the trial court only heard defendants'  motion to dismiss before enrolling the New York judgment, however, pursuant to the UEFJA and the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, defendants were entitled to a trial on the merits of the defenses to enrollment and enforcement that were raised in their answer.

        There are a limited number of circumstances where a foreign judgment may be denied full faith and credit. The factual issues underlying the foreign judgment may not be a basis of inquiry; however, where the foreign court was without jurisdiction, the judgment is denied full faith and credit. Benham v.

        Parties seeking to undermine the validity of a foreign judgment have a stern and heavy burden; therefore, if they are seeking to challenge the foreign court's jurisdiction, they must demonstrate that the foreign court did not acquire jurisdiction under the law of the state where the judgment was obtained. Biogen Distributors, Inc. v. Tanner, 842 S.W.2d 253, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 751 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).

       <p>
        Defendant's lack of minimum contacts assertions were irrelevant, since he entered a general appearance in a Florida proceeding by filing an answer to plaintiff's complaint without first raising the issue of personal jurisdiction; like Tennessee courts, Florida courts recognize that parties who do not raise the issue of lack of personal jurisdiction in their original pleading or motion to dismiss are deemed to have waived the defense and to have submitted themselves to the court's jurisdiction. Biogen Distributors, Inc. v. Tanner, 842 S.W.2d 253, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 751 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992); Remington Invs. v. Obenauf, 1 S.W.3d 666, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 227 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).

        A party seeking to attack the validity of a foreign judgment bears a stern and heavy burden; issues of fact underlying the foreign judgment may not form the basis of such an attack, but the judgment will not be afforded full faith and credit where the foreign court lacked jurisdiction. Hart v. Tourte, 10 S.W.3d 263, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 502 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 667 (Tenn. 1999).

        When a Texas franchiser sought to enroll a default judgment obtained in a lawsuit in Texas, the Texas summons and complaint were properly served on a franchisee and personal guarantors in Tennessee as the process server's affidavit supporting the franchiser's motion for substitute service complied with the requirements of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the Texas court's order instructing the process server where and how to serve the summons was appropriate, and the method of service was a reasonably effective means of providing notice.

        In a case in which the judgment creditor obtained a judgment in Minnesota and sought to enforce it in Tennessee, the trial court did not err in entering an order authenticating and enrolling the foreign judgment because the creditor's attorney provided the necessary information in the affidavit she filed with the complaint; the lack of a notary signature and stamp on the affidavit did not deprive the court clerk of the information needed to issue a summons; the judgment debtor was properly served in a timely manner; and the creditor substantially complied with the statutory requirements when she filed her complaint and cured the deficiency when her attorney filed a corrected affidavit containing a notary's signature and stamp.

        Once a foreign judgment has been enrolled, it has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating or staying as a judgment of a court of record in Tennessee and may be enforced or satisfied in a like manner.
