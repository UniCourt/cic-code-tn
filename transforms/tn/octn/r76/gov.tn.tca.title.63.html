         Compiler's Notes. Acts 2013, ch. 336, § 2, effective from July 1, 2013, until October 1, 2013, amended the definition of “pain management clinic” to read: “(5) ‘Pain management clinic’ means a privately-owned facility in which a majority of the facility's patients, seen by any or all of its medical doctors, osteopathic physicians, advanced practice nurses with certificates of fitness to prescribe, or physician assistants, are provided pain management services by being prescribed opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or carisoprodol, but not suboxone, for more than ninety (90) days in a twelve-month period; and”.
        </p>
        <p>
         Acts 2013, ch. 430, § 1 provided that the act, which amended the definition of “pain management clinic”, shall be known and may be cited as the “Addison Sharp Prescription Regulatory Act of 2013.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Acts 2013, ch. 430, § 11 provided that the department of health, the board of pharmacy or any board operating under title 63, is authorized to use emergency rules under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.04.html#t04c05s4-5-208ol1a5" target="_blank">4-5-208(a)(5)</a></cite>, in order to promulgate any rules required by the act.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments. The 2016 amendment by ch. 1033, effective July 1, 2017, deleted the former definition of “certificate holder”, which read: “‘Certificate holder’ means a medical doctor licensed under chapter 6 of this title; an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 9 of this title; an advanced practice nurse licensed under chapter 7 of this title, who meets the requirements contained in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c07s63-7-126" target="_self">63-7-126</a></cite>; or a physician assistant licensed under chapter 19 of this title, who practices in this state with an unrestricted, unencumbered license. Anyone with an ownership interest in a pain management clinic shall be eligible to be the certificate holder;”; and substituted the defined term “‘pain management clinic’ or ‘clinic’” for “pain management clinic”.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2017 amendment, in (D) of the definition of “pain management clinic”, substituted “one (1) or more” for “one or more” near the beginning, inserted “or pain management” twice, and substituted “to perform the” for “perform the” near the end; and, in the definition of “pain management specialist”, inserted “or pain management” in (A)(i), and inserted “pain medicine or” in (A)(iii).

         Amendments. The 2016 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “(a)(1)  A pain management clinic, as defined in this part, must have a medical director who is a physician that practices in this state under an unrestricted and unencumbered license issued pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c06s63-6-201" target="_self">63-6-201</a></cite> or § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c09s63-9-104" target="_self">63-9-104</a></cite>. “(2)  In addition to the requirements of subdivision (a)(1), each physician serving as a medical director at a pain management clinic shall be a pain management specialist as defined in this part. “(3)  All advanced practice nurses licensed under chapter 7 of this title and physician assistants licensed under chapter 19 of this title, who practice in a certified pain clinic, shall be supervised by a pain medicine specialist as defined in this part.“(b)  In the event that the medical director, for whatever reason, no longer meets the requirements of this part, the pain management clinic must notify the department, within ten (10) business days, of the identity of another physician who meets the requirements of this part and will act as medical director. A change of majority ownership of a certified pain management clinic requires the submission of a new application for a certificate. Failure to notify the department within ten (10) business days may be the basis for a summary suspension of the clinic's certification.“(c)  (1)  Every pain management clinic shall submit an application to the department on a form prescribed by the department for a certificate to operate the clinic. A certificate may be awarded to a certificate holder. The certificate holder shall be one (1) of the owners of the clinic. “(2)  A completed form for a certificate prescribed by the department shall show proof that the clinic has a medical director who is a pain management specialist as defined in this part.“(d)  Each clinic location shall be certified separately regardless of whether the clinic is operated under the same business name, ownership or management as another clinic.“(e)  The department shall issue a certificate if the department finds that the pain management clinic meets the requirements of this part and that the fee required by the department has been paid.“(f)  (1)  If the department finds that a pain management clinic which was issued a certificate no longer meets any requirement of this part, including, but not limited to, any violation of any rule promulgated by the department pursuant to this part, the department may impose lawful disciplinary action against the pain management clinic, including, but not limited to, the revocation or suspension of its certificate, and the imposition of a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day for each day of continued violation. The pain management clinic shall be entitled to a hearing pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5. Further, the department has the discretion to lift the suspension of a certificate when the clinic demonstrates compliance to the department. “(2)  Any board which assesses any discipline or penalty against a provider that it licenses for a violation of rules promulgated under this part shall inform the department of any penalty or discipline imposed on such a provider for a violation of rules promulgated under this part within thirty (30) days of imposing the discipline or penalty, and the department may consider such discipline or penalty as a basis for disciplinary action against the pain management clinic pursuant to this subsection (f).“(g)  The clinic shall post the certificate in a conspicuous location so as to be clearly visible to patients.“(h)  The department is authorized to charge a fee for the issuance of a certificate.“(i)  The department and each board identified in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c01s63-1-303ol1b" target="_self">63-1-303(b)</a></cite> shall post on its web site an announcement of the requirement that a pain management clinic obtain a certificate from the department, and each board identified in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c01s63-1-303ol1b" target="_self">63-1-303(b)</a></cite> shall include information about such requirement in a routine communication sent by each board to its licensees.“(j)  A pain management clinic operating on or before January 1, 2012, may continue to operate as long as an application for certification is timely filed on or before October 1, 2012. This provision shall apply retroactively to applications for certification filed since January 1, 2012.“(k)  The department shall have the authority to adopt rules, including emergency rules if deemed necessary, to implement this part for which the department has responsibility.”The 2017 amendment divided former (a)(3) into present (a)(3)(A) and (B), in present (a)(3)(A), by substituting “under chapter 7 of this title, who practice in a licensed pain clinic, shall collaborate with a pain medicine specialist. (B) All physician assistants” for “under chapter 7 of this title and physician assistants”;  and in present (a)(3)(B), substituted “licensed pain clinic” for “licensed pain management clinic” and substituted “pain medicine specialist” for “pain management specialist.”
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2018 amendment substituted “shall collaborate with a pain medicine specialist” for “shall be supervised by a pain medicine specialist” at the end of (a)(3)(B).

          Clinic continued to accept money orders and a sign posted in the office confirmed that the clinic would accept only money orders for self-pay for office visits; this practice conflicted with the statute to only allow cash payments in limited circumstances, and as appellants admitted to several billing violations and at least one improper practice continued when charges were filed, substantial and material evidence existed for the finding of a failure to maintain adequate billing records.

        Provision in an agreement between the Tennessee board of registration in podiatry and the podiatrist that precluded the podiatrist from reactivating his license in Tennessee was upheld, because the podiatrist made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his rights to apply for the license in exchange for settlement of numerous claims asserted against him; the fact that the podiatrist later learned that he was precluded from receiving federal healthcare payments was no reason to set aside the provision, which was within the full authority of the board.

       A chiropractor who purports to engage in the practice of medicine and even of surgery and exacts a fee for such “services” has been guilty of deception and fraud in the practice of chiropractic. Janeway v. State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, 33 Tenn. App. 280, 231 S.W.2d 584, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 107 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950)

       Where practitioner used his license in another field, and the title of “doctor,” such conduct amounted to a fraud and deception in the practice of the art for which a license had been issued.

R. &amp; Regs. § 0260-02-.20(6)(a) as the chiropractor admitted that the chiropractor violated the regulation by contacting an accident victim just two days after an accident, even if the chiropractor did so at the request of a family member; it was not arbitrary or capricious to discipline the chiropractor for the incident of solicitation, which occurred in 2000, even though the final order imposing the discipline was entered eight years later.

       Attorney General Opinions. Even though the Tennessee Medical Practice Act contains no express language authorizing the Board of Medical Examiners to regulate the facilities at which physicians practice, unless provided otherwise by law or Board regulation, individual physician practice requirements and standards apply to a physician's practice of medicine in any setting, including a medical clinic, OAG 04-128 (8/11/04).

        Public policy requires absolute immunity for officials performing quasi-prosecutorial or quasi-judicial functions, at least where protections such as those provided by the federal Administrative Procedure Act are in place. The Tennessee Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, ch. 5 provides procedural safeguards for contested cases comparable to those provided by the corresponding federal law, <cite class="us_code">5 U.S.C. § 554</cite> et seq.Watts v. Burkhart, 978 F.2d 269, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 27830 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1992).

        Denial of medical licensure in Tennessee to an applicant was not inappropriate because the decision by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners that the applicant's long absence from direct patient care necessitated a formal assessment before the applicant could engage in the practice of emergency medicine in Tennessee was not unclear, arbitrary and capricious, or unsupported by substantial and material evidence.

           The general assembly finds that there are special facts above and beyond ordinary competition that would give an unfair advantage to a physician when competing with the physician's former employer, if the former employer is a faculty practice plan. The existence of such special facts warrants protection of the faculty practice plan through restrictive covenants and prohibitions against an employed physician's right to practice medicine upon the termination or conclusion of the employment relationship.

         There was material and substantial evidence to support the findings of the state licensing board for the healing arts that a chiropractor exceeded the scope of his license and invaded the field of medicine by making pap smears and by drawing blood for the purpose of diagnosing various human diseases and ailments which were unrelated to chiropractic practice.

         This act prohibiting practice of naturopathy is a valid exercise of the police power. Davis v. Beeler, 185 Tenn. 638, 207 S.W.2d 343, 1947 Tenn.

         This act prohibiting practice of naturopathy is not a bill of attainder since loss of right to practice is not the result of punishment for some offense committed, but the result of failure to measure up to legislative requirements.

         The evident intent of the legislature was to withdraw recognition of naturopathy as a separate branch of the healing arts but allow the use of its methods. Davis v. Beeler, 185 Tenn. 638, 207 S.W.2d 343, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 369 (1947), appeal dismissed, <cite class="us_code">333 U.S. 859</cite>, <cite class="s_court">68 S. Ct. 745</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">92 L.

         This section merely required that persons desiring to practice naturopathy obtain a general practitioner's license or one to practice osteopathy. Davis v.

However, during any transition period, or at any time thereafter when the board shall determine that the volume of work for any given interval is unduly burdensome or costly, either the licenses or renewals, or both, may be issued for terms of not less than six (6) months nor more than eighteen (18) months. The fee imposed for any license under any renewal system for a period of other than twenty-four (24) months shall be proportionate to the biennial fee and modified in no other manner, except that the proportional fee shall be rounded off to the nearest quarter of a dollar (25¢).

         Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners had authority to revoke a doctor's retired medical license because the doctor still possessed a medical license and remained a licensee when the notice of charges was filed; the statute granting the Board authority to suspend or revoke licenses does not limit that authority based on the current status of a license. Wyttenbach v. Bd. of Tenn. Med. Examiners, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 192 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 15, 2016), appeal denied, Wyttenbach v. Bd. of TN Med. Examiners, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 674 (Tenn. Sept. 23, 2016).

         Reinstatement statute does not distinguish between a physician whose license has been automatically revoked and who has engaged in objectionable behavior prior to the automatic revocation and a physician who has merely lost track of time and neglected to apply for a license renewal within sixty days of the license's expiration date; in both cases, the physician's license has been automatically revoked, and in both cases, the physician is able to apply for reinstatement. Oni v. Tenn. Dep't of Health, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 971 (Tenn. Dec. 14, 2016).

         Physicians whose license have been automatically revoked and who have engaged in objectionable behavior prior to the automatic revocation and physicians who have merely lost track of time and neglected to apply for a license renewal within sixty days of the license's expiration date are “licensees” even after their licenses are automatically revoked; if the Board permanently revokes a physician's license for cause, however, that physician will not have the opportunity to apply for reinstatement Oni v. Tenn. Dep't of Health, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 971 (Tenn. Dec. 14, 2016).

Expert testimony is not necessary to establish the standard of care. The standard of care for such actions is a statewide standard of minimal competency and practice that does not depend upon expert testimony for its establishment.

         A physician bringing certiorari to review the findings of the board revoking his license, and after trial on merits, cannot, thereafter on petition for mandatory injunction to reinstate, attack the constitutionality of the statute on the ground that no provision is made for notice and hearing.

         Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners' decision to place the physician's medical license on probation for five years was not arbitrary or capricious where the discipline was imposed after a contested hearing, and the consent degrees involving other physicians were negotiated between the parties.

         Nothing in the statute granting the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners the authority to sanction a licensee limits that authority to those whose licenses have not been automatically revoked due to a failure to renew.

         Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners did not err in basing its revocation of a doctor's license on his failure to pay the administrative costs that were assessed against him because the doctor's payment of the administrative costs in full prior to the date of the remand hearing did not affect the Board's right to base its determination of the appropriate sanction, in part, on the fees that were outstanding when the notice of charges was filed.

          5. Standard of Care.
         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners erred in failing to articulate the applicable standard of care when it found that a physician violated the standard of care by failing to comply with the requirements of Tennessee Medical Practice Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c06s63-6-214ol1b" target="_self">63-6-214(b)</a></cite>, because pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c06s63-6-214ol1g" target="_self">63-6-214(g)</a></cite> the Board was required to articulate the applicable standard of care in its deliberations; because the case did not involve an error or deficiency in the administrative hearing or the facts but rather, an error of law and a deficiency in the record, the Board's error was properly resolved by remand to the Board to conduct deliberations based on the existing record and to articulate during the deliberations the applicable standard of care as required by the statute. Rich v. Tenn. Bd. of Med. Examiners, 350 S.W.3d 919, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 957 (Tenn. Oct. 10, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners adopts the standard of care advanced by an expert witness or independently determines the standard of care based on its own expertise, the Board must articulate the standard upon which its decision is based to allow the reviewing court to know the standard and assess the validity of the Board's decision; similarly, when the Board fails to designate the applicable standard of care, a doctor seeking subsequent review of the Board's decision is placed at an unfair disadvantage, and unless it is clear what standard the doctor is held to have violated, he or she cannot properly assess the Board's conclusions in that regard and prepare an effective argument on appeal. Rich v. Tenn. Bd. of Med. Examiners, 350 S.W.3d 919, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 957 (Tenn. Oct. 10, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Requirement that the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners articulate the applicable standard of care in its deliberations serves a twofold purpose: it gives guidance to other physicians practicing medicine in the state as to the standard to which they are expected to conform and informs the reviewing court of the basis for the Board's decision; articulation of the adopted standard of care is critical in cases where the Tennessee Department of Health and the respondent physician have not agreed as to the applicable standard of care, and have submitted conflicting expert testimony in that regard, and even where only one party has presented expert testimony to establish the applicable standard, the Board may reject such testimony and determine a different standard based on its own expertise. Rich v. Tenn. Bd. of Med. Examiners, 350 S.W.3d 919, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 957 (Tenn. Oct. 10, 2011).

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners had authority to revoke a doctor's retired medical license because the doctor still possessed a medical license and remained a licensee when the notice of charges was filed; the statute granting the Board authority to suspend or revoke licenses does not limit that authority based on the current status of a license.

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         Trial court erred in ruling the Board of Medical Examiners lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sanction a doctor because the Board had subject matter jurisdiction over the doctor when the case was remanded, even though during the intervening time period his license was automatically revoked for his failure to seek renewal; the doctor's status as a licensee was not altered by the fact that his license had been revoked, and the Board exercised its discretion to revoke his license for cause. Oni v. Tenn. Dep't of Health, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 971 (Tenn. Dec. 14, 2016).

        </h4>
        <p>
         Doctor failed to show that the decision of the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners to revoke his license was unwarranted in law or unjustified in fact because the Board's factual findings were supported by the record, and the Board was authorized by statute to revoke a medical license; the Board found the doctor was intentionally dishonest in his dealings with a medical board and that he failed to pay the majority of administrative costs. Oni v. Tenn. Dep't of Health, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 971 (Tenn. Dec. 14, 2016).

        <p>
         Denial of medical licensure in Tennessee to an applicant was not inappropriate because the decision by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners that the applicant's long absence from direct patient care necessitated a formal assessment before the applicant could engage in the practice of emergency medicine in Tennessee was not unclear, arbitrary and capricious, or unsupported by substantial and material evidence.

         It is the stated policy of Tennessee to encourage each CHMIS to candidly, conscientiously and objectively monitor and improve the level of community wellness and quality of health care delivery services and financial reimbursement systems. Tennessee further recognizes that confidentiality is essential both to effective functioning of the CHMIS and to continued improvement in the access to, the efficiency of and the quality of health care services. As incentive for the providers, payors and users of health care services to participate in a quality assessment committee, such quality assessment committee must be protected from liability for its good faith efforts. To this end, a quality assessment committee of a CHMIS should be granted certain immunities relating to its actions undertaken as part of its responsibility to collect, analyze and refine health care data. In instances of a quality assessment committee examining the appropriateness of physicians' fees, this immunity must also extend to restraint of trade claims under title 47, chapter 25.

         <p>
          Your mammogram shows that you have dense breast tissue. Dense breast tissue is common. However, dense breast tissue can hide breast cancer, so that it may not be seen on routine mammography. It may also be associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. You should discuss these results with your doctor to determine if additional tests might be helpful. A report of your mammogram results, which contains information about your breast density, has been sent to your doctor's office.

Dense breast tissue is common and is not abnormal. However, dense breast tissue can make it harder to evaluate the results of your mammogram and may also be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This information about the results of your mammogram is given to you to raise your awareness and to inform your conversations with your doctor.

          The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:

          INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT
         </p>
         <p>
          SECTION 1.  PURPOSE
         </p>
         <p>
          In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards, provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act. The Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the Compact.

          A physician must meet the eligibility requirements as defined in Section 2(k) to receive an expedited license under the terms and provisions of the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          A physician who does not meet the requirements of Section 2(k) may obtain a license to practice medicine in a member state if the individual complies with all laws and requirements, other than the Compact, relating to the issuance of a license to practice medicine in that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          A physician shall designate a member state as the state of principal license for purposes of registration for expedited licensure through the Compact if the physician possesses a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in that state, and the state is:
         </p>
         <p>
          A physician may redesignate a member state as state of principal license at any time, as long as the state meets the requirements in subsection (a).
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules to facilitate redesignation of another member state as the state of principal license.
         </p>
         <p>
          A physician seeking licensure through the Compact shall file an application for an expedited license with the member board of the state selected by the physician as the state of principal license.
         </p>
         <p>
          Upon receipt of an application for an expedited license, the member board within the state selected as the state of principal license shall evaluate whether the physician is eligible for expedited licensure and issue a letter of qualification, verifying or denying the physician's eligibility, to the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          Static qualifications, which include verification of medical education, graduate medical education, results of any medical or licensing examination, and other qualifications as determined by the Interstate Commission through rule, shall not be subject to additional primary source verification where already primary source verified by the state of principal license.
         </p>
         <p>
          The member board within the state selected as the state of principal license shall, in the course of verifying eligibility, perform a criminal background check of an applicant, including the use of the results of fingerprint or other biometric data checks compliant with the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the exception of federal employees who have suitability determination in accordance with 5 C.F.R. 731.202.
         </p>
         <p>
          Appeal on the determination of eligibility shall be made to the member state where the application was filed and shall be subject to the law of that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Upon verification in subsection (b), physicians eligible for an expedited license shall complete the registration process established by the Interstate Commission to receive a license in a member state selected pursuant to subsection (a), including the payment of any applicable fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          After receiving verification of eligibility under subsection (b) and any fees under subsection (c), a member board shall issue an expedited license to the physician. This license shall authorize the physician to practice medicine in the issuing state consistent with the Medical Practice Act and all applicable laws and regulations of the issuing member board and member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          An expedited license shall be valid for a period consistent with the licensure period in the member state and in the same manner as required for other physicians holding a full and unrestricted license within the member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          An expedited license obtained through the Compact shall be terminated if a physician fails to maintain a license in the state of principal licensure for a non-disciplinary reason, without redesignation of a new state of principal licensure.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules regarding the application process, including payment of any applicable fees, and the issuance of an expedited license.
         </p>
         <p>
          A member state issuing an expedited license authorizing the practice of medicine in that state may impose a fee for a license issued or renewed through the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules regarding fees for expedited licenses.
         </p>
         <p>
          A physician seeking to renew an expedited license granted in a member state shall complete a renewal process with the Interstate Commission if the physician:
         </p>
         <p>
          Maintains a full and unrestricted license in a state of principal license;
         </p>
         <p>
          Has not been convicted, received adjudication, deferred adjudication, community supervision, or deferred disposition for any offense by a court of appropriate jurisdiction;
         </p>
         <p>
          Has not had a license authorizing the practice of medicine subject to discipline by a licensing agency in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, excluding any action related to non-payment of fees related to a license; and
         </p>
         <p>
          Has not had a controlled substance license or permit suspended or revoked by a state or the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
         </p>
         <p>
          Physicians shall comply with all continuing professional development or continuing medical education requirements for renewal of a license issued by a member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall collect any renewal fees charged for the renewal of a license and distribute the fees to the applicable member board.
         </p>
         <p>
          Upon receipt of any renewal fees collected in subsection (c), a member board shall renew the physician's license.
         </p>
         <p>
          Physician information collected by the Interstate Commission during the renewal process will be distributed to all member boards.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules to address renewal of licenses obtained through the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall establish a database of all physicians licensed, or who have applied for licensure, under Section 5.
         </p>
         <p>
          Notwithstanding any other provision of law, member boards shall report to the Interstate Commission any public action or complaints against a licensed physician who has applied or received an expedited license through the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          Member boards shall report disciplinary or investigatory information determined as necessary and proper by rule of the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          Member boards may report any non-public complaint, disciplinary, or investigatory information not required by subsection (c) to the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          Member boards shall share complaint or disciplinary information about a physician upon request of another member board.
         </p>
         <p>
          All information provided to the Interstate Commission or distributed by member boards shall be confidential, filed under seal, and used only for investigatory or disciplinary matters.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of information by member boards.
         </p>
         <p>
          Licensure and disciplinary records of physicians are deemed investigative.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to the authority granted to a member board by its respective Medical Practice Act or other applicable state law, a member board may participate with other member boards in joint investigations of physicians licensed by the member boards.
         </p>
         <p>
          A subpoena issued by a member state shall be enforceable in other member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          Member boards may share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          Any member state may investigate actual or alleged violations of the statutes authorizing the practice of medicine in any other member state in which a physician holds a license to practice medicine.
         </p>
         <p>
          Any disciplinary action taken by any member board against a physician licensed through the Compact shall be deemed unprofessional conduct which may be subject to discipline by other member boards, in addition to any violation of the Medical Practice Act or regulations in that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a license granted to a physician by the member board in the state of principal license is revoked, surrendered or relinquished in lieu of discipline, or suspended, then all licenses issued to the physician by member boards shall automatically be placed, without further action necessary by any member board, on the same status. If the member board in the state of principal license subsequently reinstates the physician's license, a license issued to the physician by any other member board shall remain encumbered until that respective member board takes action to reinstate the license in a manner consistent with the Medical Practice Act of that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          If disciplinary action is taken against a physician by a member board not in the state of principal license, any other member board may deem the action conclusive as to matter of law and fact decided, and:
         </p>
         <p>
          impose the same or lesser sanction(s) against the physician so long as such sanctions are consistent with the Medical Practice Act of that state; or
         </p>
         <p>
          pursue separate disciplinary action against the physician under its respective Medical Practice Act, regardless of the action taken in other member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a license granted to a physician by a member board is revoked, surrendered or relinquished in lieu of discipline, or suspended, then any license(s) issued to the physician by any other member board(s) shall be suspended, automatically and immediately without further action necessary by the other member board(s), for ninety (90) days upon entry of the order by the disciplining board, to permit the member board(s) to investigate the basis for the action under the Medical Practice Act of that state. A member board may terminate the automatic suspension of the license it issued prior to the completion of the ninety (90) day suspension period in a manner consistent with the Medical Practice Act of that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The member states hereby create the “Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission”.
         </p>
         <p>
          The purpose of the Interstate Commission is the administration of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, which is a discretionary state function.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the member states and shall have all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth in the Compact, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by a subsequent concurrent action of the respective legislatures of the member states in accordance with the terms of the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall consist of two voting representatives appointed by each member state who shall serve as Commissioners. In states where allopathic and osteopathic physicians are regulated by separate member boards, or if the licensing and disciplinary authority is split between multiple member boards within a member state, the member state shall appoint one representative from each member board. A Commissioner shall be a(n):
         </p>
         <p>
          Allopathic or osteopathic physician appointed to a member board;
         </p>
         <p>
          Executive director, executive secretary, or similar executive of a member board; or
         </p>
         <p>
          Member of the public appointed to a member board.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. A portion of this meeting shall be a business meeting to address such matters as may properly come before the Commission, including the election of officers. The chairperson may call additional meetings and shall call for a meeting upon the request of a majority of the member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bylaws may provide for meetings of the Interstate Commission to be conducted by telecommunication or electronic communication.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each Commissioner participating at a meeting of the Interstate Commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of Commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the Interstate Commission. A Commissioner shall not delegate a vote to another Commissioner. In the absence of its Commissioner, a member state may delegate voting authority for a specified meeting to another person from that state who shall meet the requirements of subsection (d).
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall provide public notice of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public. The Interstate Commission may close a meeting, in full or in portion, where it determines by a two-thirds vote of the Commissioners present that an open meeting would be likely to:
         </p>
         <p>
          Relate solely to the internal personnel practices and procedures of the Interstate Commission;
         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          Involve accusing a person of a crime, or formally censuring a person;
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, including record of any roll call votes.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records, to the extent not otherwise designated in the Compact or by its rules, available to the public for inspection.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall establish an executive committee, which shall include officers, members, and others as determined by the bylaws. The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission, with the exception of rulemaking, during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session. When acting on behalf of the Interstate Commission, the executive committee shall oversee the administration of the Compact including enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the Compact, its bylaws and rules, and other such duties as necessary.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission may establish other committees for governance and administration of the Compact.

         <p>
          Pay, or provide for the payment of the expenses related to the establishment, organization, and ongoing activities of the Interstate Commission;

          The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff. The total assessment must be sufficient to cover the annual budget approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same.

          The Interstate Commission shall not pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by, and with the authority of, the member state.

         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall be subject to a yearly financial audit conducted by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of Commissioners present and voting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Compact within twelve (12) months of the first Interstate Commission meeting.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall elect or appoint annually from among its Commissioners a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson, or in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          Officers selected in subsection (b) shall serve without remuneration from the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The officers and employees of the Interstate Commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of, or relating to, an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate Commission shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the “Model State Administrative Procedure Act” of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.
         </p>
         <p>
          Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the Compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of the Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law but shall not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine.
         </p>
         <p>
          All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, the Compact, or promulgated rules.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.
         </p>
         <p>
          The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the Compact, or the rules and bylaws of the Interstate Commission promulgated under the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the Compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:
         </p>
         <p>
          Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and
         </p>
         <p>
          Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the Compact shall terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
         </p>
         <p>
          Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state, or the withdrawal of a member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The member state which has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the Compact and which may arise among member states or member boards.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution as appropriate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Any state is eligible to become a member state of the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than seven (7) states. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding on a state upon enactment of the Compact into law by that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The governors of non-member states, or their designees, shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a non-voting basis prior to adoption of the Compact by all states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the Compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that a member state may withdraw from the Compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.
         </p>
         <p>
          Withdrawal from the Compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one (1) year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the Compact in the withdrawing state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt of notice provided under subsection (c).
         </p>
         <p>
          The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules to address the impact of the withdrawal of a member state on licenses granted in other member states to physicians who designated the withdrawing member state as the state of principal license.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the Compact to one (1) member state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Upon the dissolution of the Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of the Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Compact shall be enforceable.
         </p>
         <p>
          The provisions of the Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nothing in the Compact shall be construed to prohibit the applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          All laws in a member state in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
         </p>
         <p>
          All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.

Therefore, physicians may invest in and refer to an outside entity, whether or not they provide direct care or services at or for the entity, if there is a demonstrated need in the community for the entity and alternative financing is not available. In such cases, the following requirements apply:

       <p>
        One may practice the nursing profession with or without receiving compensation, and the statute regarding expert witnesses does not contain a compensation requirement, and to read one into the statute would be contrary to the legislature's intent; the trial court erred in holding that a nurse was not qualified as a medical expert because she did not receive monetary compensation for her services as her mother-in-law's private duty nurse, as monetary compensation is not required to establish that an expert has practiced in his or her field.

        In light of the absence of any evidence or factual findings regarding a nurse's current psychological condition, the Tennessee board of nursing acted arbitrarily and capriciously by immediately suspending her license as part of a disciplinary proceeding for her abandonment of patients; while the board had the statutory authority to require nurses to submit evidence of nursing competence, including satisfactory physical and mental health, before the renewal of their registration, it did not have the statutory authority in the absence of evidence that supported a finding that a nurse's psychological condition rendered the nurse unfit to practice nursing to summarily suspend the nurse's license pending a psychological examination.

        Tennessee board of nursing properly ordered a nurse to pay a civil penalty for engaging in unprofessional conduct by abandoning patients in violation of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c07s63-7-115ol1a1F" target="_self">63-7-115(a)(1)(F)</a></cite> and Tenn.

        In a nurse's disciplinary action where the nurse abandoned patients by leaving the hospital before the end of her shift without notifying her supervisor, while the nurse testified that the records regarding the vandalism and resisting arrest charges had been expunged, she failed to present evidence supporting her claim; in the absence of the corroborating evidence that the records regarding her two convictions had been lawfully expunged, the nurse's testimony that she had pled guilty to vandalism and resisting arrest provided the substantial and material evidence needed to support the Tennessee board of nursing's conclusion that the nurse was “guilty of a crime” for the purpose of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c07s63-7-115ol1a1B" target="_self">63-7-115(a)(1)(B)</a></cite>.

        Tennessee Board of Nursing did not err by denying the applicant a contested case because this section did not mandate that a contested case occur, and even if the applicant's liberty interests were implicated, he received all of the process to which he was entitled because his meetings with the Board qualified as a name-clearing hearing.

          The Nurse Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining the compact and in the form substantially as follows:
         </p>
         <p>
          THE NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT
         </p>
         <p>
          Article I.  Findings and Declaration of Purpose
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  The party states find that:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
         </p>
         <p>
          4.  New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;
         </p>
         <p>
          5.  The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and
         </p>
         <p>
          6.  Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  The general purposes of this compact are to:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation and adverse actions;
         </p>
         <p>
          4.  Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;
         </p>
         <p>
          5.  Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;
         </p>
         <p>
          6.  Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and
         </p>
         <p>
          7.  Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.
         </p>
         <p>
          Article II.  Definitions
         </p>

         <p>
          1.  Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or

         <p>
          2.  Investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.

         </p>
         <p>
          Article III. General Provisions and Jurisdiction
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement.

          d.  All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation or any other action that affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.
         </p>
         <p>
          e.  A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.
         </p>
         <p>
          f.  Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.
         </p>
         <p>
          g.  Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home state, provided that:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this compact's effective date, must meet all applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a multistate license from a new home state.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Article III.c. due to a disqualifying event occurring after this compact's effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators (“Commission”).
         </p>
         <p>
          Article IV. Applications for Licensure in a Party State
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.
         </p>
         <p>
          c.  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.
         </p>
         <p>
          d.  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.
         </p>
         <p>
          Article V.  Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.
         </p>
         <p>
          i.  Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state.
         </p>
         <p>
          ii.  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
         </p>
         <p>
          4.  Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
         </p>
         <p>
          5.  Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions.
         </p>
         <p>
          6.  If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse.
         </p>
         <p>
          7.  Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
         </p>
         <p>
          c.  Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.
         </p>
         <p>
          Article VI.  Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  The Commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          c.  All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.
         </p>
         <p>
          d.  Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
         </p>
         <p>
          e.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.
         </p>
         <p>
          f.  Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.
         </p>
         <p>
          g.  Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.

         <p>
          h.  The Compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:

         </p>
         <p>

          2.  Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located.

          Article VIII.  Rulemaking
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment and shall have the same force and effect as provisions of this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          c.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  On the website of the Commission; and
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  On the website of each licensing board or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.
         </p>
         <p>
          d.  The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  The proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  The text of the proposed rule or amendment, and the reason for the proposed rule;
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
         </p>
         <p>
          4.  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.
         </p>
         <p>
          e.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.
         </p>
         <p>
          f.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment.
         </p>
         <p>
          g.  The Commission shall publish the place, time and date of the scheduled public hearing.
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. All hearings will be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.
         </p>
         <p>
          h.  If no one appears at the public hearing, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.
         </p>
         <p>
          i.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.
         </p>
         <p>
          j.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
         </p>
         <p>
          k.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  Prevent a loss of Commission or party state funds; or
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule.
         </p>
         <p>
          l.  The Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the Commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          Article IX.  Oversight, Dispute Resolution and Enforcement
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  Oversight
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  Default, Technical Assistance and Termination
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:
         </p>
         <p>
          i.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and
         </p>
         <p>
          ii.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states.
         </p>
         <p>
          4.  A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
         </p>
         <p>
          5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.
         </p>
         <p>
          6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          c.  Dispute Resolution
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and non-party states.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:
         </p>
         <p>
          i.  The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute.
         </p>
         <p>
          ii.  The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.
         </p>
         <p>
          d.  Enforcement
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
         </p>
         <p>
          Article X. Effective Date, Withdrawal and Amendment
         </p>
         <p>
          a.  This compact shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date of legislative enactment of this compact into law by no less than twenty-six (26) states or December 31, 2018. All party states to this compact, that also were parties to the prior Nurse Licensure Compact, superseded by this compact, (“Prior compact”), shall be deemed to have withdrawn from said Prior compact within six (6) months after the effective date of this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          b.  Each party state to this compact shall continue to recognize a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the Prior compact until such party state has withdrawn from the Prior compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          c.  Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. A party state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.
         </p>
         <p>
          d.  A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.
         </p>
         <p>
          e.  Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a non-party state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          f.  This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.
         </p>
         <p>
          g.  Representatives of non-party states to this compact shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.
         </p>
         <p>
          Article XI. Construction and Severability
         </p>
         <p>
          This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.

       This chapter makes no distinction between members of the class of individuals known as optometrists, and does not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. 14. State v. Sowder, 826 S.W.2d 924, 1991 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 798 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991), cert. denied, Sowder v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">510 U.S. 883</cite>, <cite class="s_court">114 S. Ct. 229</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">126 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 184, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 5939 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exhibits were evidence that the Tennessee legislature was concerned about dangers of optometrists practicing in, or in conjunction with, any commercial entity, regardless of in-state or out-of-state ownership, which is a legitimate concern. Also, plaintiffs failed to establish how the activities summarized in the exhibits impacted the legislative process so as to produce a discriminatory statute. Lenscrafters, Inc. v. Robinson, 248 F. Supp. 2d 705, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3538 (M.D. Tenn. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Law prohibiting plaintiff retail optical stores from leasing space and equipment inside their stores to licensed optometrists was not adopted for discriminatory purposes and any burdens imposed did not clearly exceed the statute's putative benefits; thus, the statute was not an unconstitutional infringement on interstate commerce. LensCrafters, Inc. v. Wadley, 248 F. Supp. 2d 705, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3613 (M.D. Tenn. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff retail optical outlets offered no authority in support of their argument that a statute prohibiting retail optical stores from leasing space and equipment inside their stores to licensed optometrists could be invalidated under the equal protection clause; moreover, defendants cited legislative history indicating that the T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c08s63-8-113ol1c6" target="_self">63-8-113(c)(6)</a></cite> was intended to apply to in-state retail stores leasing space to onsite optometrists as well as out-of-state retail stores leasing space to onsite optometrists and thus, the provision did not violate the equal protection clause. LensCrafters, Inc. v. Wadley, 248 F. Supp. 2d 705, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3613 (M.D. Tenn. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Law prohibiting plaintiff retail optical stores from leasing space and equipment inside their stores to licensed optometrists was rationally related to the state's goal of insulating health care professionals from commercial influences; thus, the statute stood up under strict scrutiny on the stores' due process claim. LensCrafters, Inc. v. Wadley, 248 F. Supp. 2d 705, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3613 (M.D. Tenn. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of plaintiffs' Commerce Clause challenge to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c08s63-8-113ol1c6" target="_self">63-8-113(c)(6)</a></cite> was affirmed because no rational factfinder could have concluded that the challenged provision was purposefully discriminatory; the challenged provision did not discriminate among optical companies wishing to sell eyewear, as both in-state and out-of-state optical companies were prohibited from leasing space to optometrists. Lenscrafters, Inc. v. Robinson, 403 F.3d 798, 2005 FED App. 174P, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 6149 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2005), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1172</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 1335</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">164 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 51, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 1174 (2006).

       As used in this part, “program” and “third-party prescription program” mean any system of providing for the reimbursement of pharmaceutical services under a contractual arrangement or agreement between a provider of such services and another party who is not the consumer of those services. Such programs may include, but not be limited to, employee benefit plans whereby a consumer receives prescription drugs or other pharmaceutical services and those services are paid for by an agent of the employer or others.

         A license to practice pharmacy does not empower pharmacists to inject drugs into a patient. Reeves-Sain Med., Inc. v. Bluecross Blueshield of Tenn., 40 S.W.3d 503, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 663 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the statute defining the practice of pharmacy does not contain a prohibition on making a medical diagnosis, it does not render a pharmacist ipso facto incompetent to express any opinion on causation for purposes of satisfying the statute regarding expert testimony in a health care liability action when the pharmacist's expert opinion is otherwise admissible and relevant. Kidd v. Dickerson, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 443 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 5, 2020).

         Because a pharmacy license covers the pharmaceutical component of home infusion therapy, but by its terms does not cover the non-pharmaceutical component, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.56.html#t56c07s56-7-2359ol1a1" target="_blank">56-7-2359(a)(1)</a></cite> does not prevent the health care insurer from imposing additional requirements on the non-pharmaceutical component of home infusion therapy.

          It is the policy of the state to encourage committees made up of Tennessee's licensed pharmacists to candidly, conscientiously and objectively evaluate their peers' professional conduct, competence and ability to practice pharmacy and their personal conduct as it relates to the performance of their professional duties. It is further the policy of the state to encourage pharmacists to implement continuous quality improvement programs and quality assurance programs to identify and evaluate quality-related events, reduce medication-related errors, generate data useful to studying the causes of medication errors and improve patient care. The state further recognizes that confidentiality is essential to effective functioning of peer review committees, continuous quality improvement programs and quality assurance programs and to continued improvement in patient safety and patient care.

         On an appeal from a finding that petitioner, an inmate, was competent to withdraw his petition for postconviction relief, there was no error in the consideration of a doctor's report and testimony. His license was not suspended but was in a grace period of payment of his license fee and thus, his license was valid; the assessments employed by the doctor enjoyed longstanding acceptance and use in the psychological community; the doctor was qualified to administer the tests; the inmate's counsel had the opportunity to question the doctor regarding the reliability of the personality assessments; and any consideration as to the reliability of the testing in a non-contact setting went to the weight of the testimony and not its admissibility.

         Trial court erred by failing to consider a husband's claims that his psychological records were protected from disclosure by the psychologist-client privilege under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-213" target="_self">63-11-213</a></cite>) as it provided no reasoning as to why the husband's records were not protected from discovery by the privilege or the extent to which the husband possibly waived the privilege.

         On an appeal from a finding that petitioner, an inmate, was competent to withdraw his petition for postconviction relief, there was no error in the consideration of a doctor's report and testimony. His license was not suspended but was in a grace period of payment of his license fee and thus, his license was valid; the assessments employed by the doctor enjoyed longstanding acceptance and use in the psychological community; the doctor was qualified to administer the tests; the inmate's counsel had the opportunity to question the doctor regarding the reliability of the personality assessments; and any consideration as to the reliability of the testing in a non-contact setting went to the weight of the testimony and not its admissibility.

         Amendments. The 2020 amendment, in (a), substituted “must” for “shall” and inserted “referring practitioner who is a”; substituted “initial patient visit” for “initial evaluation of a patient” in (a)(1); in (a)(3)(A), inserted “physical” following “best of a” and substituted “healthcare” for “health care”; rewrote (a)(4) which read: “(4) Treat a patient without a referral when all of the following apply: (A)  When a patient provides the name of a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy and expressly wants the physical therapist to inform that physician, the physical therapist shall inform the patient's licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy no later than five (5) business days after the evaluation. A consultation shall occur between the physical therapist and the patient's licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy within the first six (6) visits or fifteen (15) business days, whichever comes first, of the findings of the patient's initial visit for physical therapy and any subsequent visits. Should that consultation not take place, no further therapy beyond the six (6) visits or fifteen (15) days, whichever comes first, shall be delivered; (B)  When a patient does not provide the name of a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy or expressly states to the therapist that the patient does not want a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy informed of the initiation of therapy services, the therapist shall have the patient sign a consent form that confirms the patient either does not have a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy or does not want a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy informed of the initiation of therapy treatment. The consent form shall be maintained in the patient's record; (C)  If the patient presents to the physical therapist for a problem for which the patient has been seen by a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy within the past twelve (12) months, the consent of the patient is not necessary to inform that licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy of the presentation for the physical therapy treatment. If the patient has no licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy, then the physical therapist shall make a suggestion from the list of available providers and shall inform the patient of the thirty-day limitation in subdivision (a)(4)(E); (D)  If the physical therapist determines, based on reasonable evidence, that no substantial progress has been made with respect to that patient within fifteen (15) calendar days or six (6) visits, whichever occurs first, immediately following the date of the patient's initial visit with the physical therapist, the physical therapist shall not provide any additional physical therapy services and shall refer the patient to a licensed physician, doctor of chiropractic, dentist, podiatrist or osteopath. If the patient previously was diagnosed with chronic, neuromuscular or developmental conditions by a physician, doctor of chiropractic, dentist, podiatrist or osteopath and the evaluation, treatment or services are being provided for problems or symptoms associated with one (1) or more of those previously diagnosed conditions, then this subdivision (a)(4)(D) shall not apply. If a patient returns to the physical therapist within ninety (90) days of treatment with the same complaint, then the physical therapist shall make an immediate referral to the appropriate health care provider; (E)  When a patient's licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy has not been notified of the physical therapy services, under no circumstances should therapy services continue beyond thirty (30) days immediately following the date of the patient's first visit; (F) (i) It shall be considered unprofessional conduct for the purposes of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c13s63-13-312" target="_self">63-13-312</a></cite> for a physical therapist to knowingly initiate services for the same complaint for which a patient: (a)  Has started therapy services but another therapist did not inform a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy within five (5) business days of the initial evaluation in accordance with subdivision (a)(4)(A); (b)  Has reached the fifteen (15) day and six (6) visit limit imposed by subdivision (a)(4)(D) where no substantial progress has been made from another physical therapist; or (c)  Has reached the thirty-day limit imposed by subdivision (a)(4)(E); (ii)  This subdivision (a)(4)(F) does not apply if a referral from a licensed doctor of medicine, chiropractic, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy is made; and (G)  If, at any time, the physical therapist has reason to believe that the patient has symptoms or conditions that require treatment or services beyond the scope of practice of a physical therapist, the physical therapist shall refer the patient to a licensed health care practitioner acting within the practitioner's scope of practice.”; and added (c)

          Section 10. Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement
         </p>
         <p>
          A.  Oversight
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.

         <p>
          B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination

         <p>

          b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          4.  A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
         </p>
         <p>
          5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.
         </p>
         <p>
          6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          C.  Dispute Resolution
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
         </p>
         <p>
          D.  Enforcement
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
         </p>
         <p>
          3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
         </p>
         <p>
          Section 11. Date of Implementation of the Interstate Commission for Physical Therapy Practice and Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendment
         </p>
         <p>
          A.  The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          B.  Any state that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.
         </p>
         <p>
          C.  Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.
         </p>
         <p>
          1.  A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.

       Not all restrictions on advertising by dispensing opticians, such as reasonable regulation of its time, place or manner, are violative of the right of free speech, but only its complete prohibition.

      <p>
       Where dispensing opticians in Georgia were not dispensing in Tennessee but were advertising in Tennessee news media, the court held that there was no jurisdiction to enjoin, since the act applied solely to the activity of dispensing opticals in Tennessee. Tennessee Board of Dispensing Opticians v. Roy H. Park, Broadcasting of Tennessee, Inc., 512 S.W.2d 579, 1973 Tenn. App. LEXIS 262 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1973).

      <p>
       Dispensing opticians who are largely dispensers of standardized products are not sufficiently professional to justify a prohibition against advertising. Horner-Rausch Optical Co. v. Ashley, 547 S.W.2d 577, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 229 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere possibility of overconsumption, which exists whenever there is advertising and which has not been shown to be an especially real or potentially harmful problem, is outweighed by the substantial benefit that would accrue from advertising in the form of lower prices and wider availability of services to low income groups.

Following such review, the board may renew the license or certificate of registration only upon an affirmative finding that the person can be expected to satisfactorily discharge the duties of an administrator in the future, in a manner that assures an adequate level of care for nursing home residents.

       <p>
        Recognized standard of acceptable professional practice for physician assistants is that of physician assistants, not physicians. Accordingly, the Supreme Court of Tennessee agrees with those authorities who differentiate between the standard of care that must be met by physicians and the standard of care which must be met by physician assistants. Cox v. M.A. Primary & Urgent Care Clinic, 313 S.W.3d 240, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. June 21, 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grant of summary judgment in favor of a clinic and supervising physician in the patient's action for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of a physician assistant's failure to diagnose her condition was appropriate because the professional standard of care applicable to physician assistants was distinct from that applicable to physicians and the patient introduced no expert proof as to any violation of the applicable standard of care. It was illogical to impose significant limitations on physician assistants and yet at the same time hold them to the same standard of care imposed upon their supervisors. Cox v. M.A. Primary & Urgent Care Clinic, 313 S.W.3d 240, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. June 21, 2010).

        It was not the Legislature's intent to set forth two distinct duties, and the second sentence referencing the specific regulations merely elaborates on the broader general goal intended by the Legislature and sets forth how this broader goal of active and continuous overview of the physician assistant's activities is to be specifically accomplished; by presenting evidence demonstrating the doctor's compliance with the regulations referenced in the second sentence, he sufficiently proved that he maintained active and continuous overview of the physician assistant's activities sufficient for a grant of summary judgment.

        Trial court properly reversed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) charges filed against a physician assistant (PA) because the interpretation of the Physician Assistants Act by the Department of Health was contrary to law and improperly placed the duty on the PA to determine whether a supervising physician was in compliance with an unwritten requirement that the physician be registered with the DEA to be able to supervise a physician assistant who prescribed controlled substances.

        Trial court did not err in awarding a physician assistant attorney fees and costs because the facts were not sufficient for the Department of Health to charge Sparks with a violation; the Physician Assistants Act does not include a requirement that a supervising physician be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the statutes governing health-related boards require them to give notice of changes in the applicable laws prior to bringing charges for enforcement.

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of a clinic and supervising physician in the patient's action for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of a physician assistant's failure to diagnose her condition was appropriate because the professional standard of care applicable to physician assistants was distinct from that applicable to physicians and the patient introduced no expert proof as to any violation of the applicable standard of care. It was illogical to impose significant limitations on physician assistants and yet at the same time hold them to the same standard of care imposed upon their supervisors, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c19s63-19-106ol1b" target="_self">63-19-106(b)</a></cite>.

        Executor suggested that summary judgment was improper because wound care was not within the doctor's usual scope of practice, as he stated only five percent of his practice involved wound care, and this was not “usual” as set forth in the statute; the fact that a physician is only spending five percent of his time on wound care is not significant, and the fact that a physician assistant's job has a much higher percentage of wound care, thereby freeing up the physician for more complex medical tasks, demonstrates the statute is accomplishing the legislature's intended goals.

        Trial court properly reversed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) charges the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners'  Committee on Physician Assistants filed against a physician assistant (PA) because to the extent the PA inadvertently prescribed controlled substances without the appropriate delegated authority due to her supervising physician not possessing a DEA registration, the error, if any, would be with the supervising physician. Tenn. Dep't of Health v. Sparks, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 439 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 6, 2019), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (Tenn. Jan. 15, 2020).

        Trial court properly reversed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) charges filed against a physician assistant (PA) because the interpretation of the Physician Assistants Act by the Department of Health was contrary to law and improperly placed the duty on the PA to determine whether a supervising physician was in compliance with an unwritten requirement that the physician be registered with the DEA to be able to supervise a physician assistant who prescribed controlled substances. Tenn. Dep't of Health v. Sparks, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 439 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 6, 2019), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (Tenn. Jan. 15, 2020).

        Trial court did not err in awarding a physician assistant attorney fees and costs because the facts were not sufficient for the Department of Health to charge Sparks with a violation; the Physician Assistants Act does not include a requirement that a supervising physician be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the statutes governing health-related boards require them to give notice of changes in the applicable laws prior to bringing charges for enforcement. Tenn. Dep't of Health v. Sparks, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 439 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 6, 2019), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (Tenn. Jan. 15, 2020).

Advanced master's or doctorate social work practice requires the application of specialized knowledge and advanced practice skills in the areas of education, research, advocacy, community organization, mediation, consultation, assessment, treatment planning, implementation and evaluation, case management, counseling, supportive counseling, direct practice, information and referral, supervision, and the development, implementation, and administration of policies, programs and activities. The nonclinical advanced practice of social work may occur independently outside the jurisdiction of an agency or organizational setting in which the social worker assumes responsibility and accountability for the nature and quality of the services provided to clients, pro bono or in exchange for direct payment or third-party reimbursement. The practice of advanced social work as a nonclinical social worker may include the practice activities of a licensed baccalaureate social worker or licensed master's social worker, or both. The practice of advanced master's or doctorate social work may include the practice of clinical social work under the clinical supervision of a licensed clinical social worker as an avenue for licensure as a clinical social worker without the benefit of direct payments or third-party reimbursements for clinical practice. Practice at this level may include the provision of supervision for licensed or temporarily licensed master's social workers seeking to become licensed advanced practice social workers. Licensed advanced practice social workers may not hold themselves out as a licensed clinical social worker. A social worker may not prescribe medication or interpret psychological tests.

       The practice of advanced master's or doctorate social work as a licensed clinical social worker is a specialty within the practice of social work that requires the application of social work theory, knowledge, methods, principles, values, ethics, and the professional use of self to restore or enhance social, psychosocial or biopsychosocial functioning of individuals, couples, families, groups or persons who are adversely affected by social or psychosocial stress or health impairment. The practice of clinical social work requires the application of specialized clinical knowledge and advanced clinical skills in the areas of assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders, conditions and addictions, including severe mental illness in adults and serious emotional disturbances in children, case management, direct practice, information and referral, clinical and nonclinical supervision, and the development, implementation, and administration of policies, programs and activities. Treatment methods include the provision of individual, marital, couple, family, and group therapy, mediation, counseling, supportive counseling, advanced case management, direct practice and psychotherapy. Clinical social workers are qualified to use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), and other diagnostic classification systems in assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and other activities. The advanced practice of clinical social work may occur outside the jurisdiction of an agency or organizational setting in which the social worker assumes responsibility and accountability for the nature and quality of the services provided to clients, pro bono or in exchange for direct payment or third-party reimbursement. Practice at this level may include the provision of supervision for licensed or temporarily licensed master's social workers seeking advanced licensure as an advanced practice social worker or as a licensed clinical social worker. Licensed clinical social workers may engage in both independent clinical and agency-based, nonclinical, macro social work practice. A social worker may not prescribe medication or interpret psychological tests. The practice of advanced master's or doctorate social work as a licensed clinical social worker may include the practice activities of a licensed baccalaureate social worker, licensed master's social worker and/or licensed advanced practice social worker.

      The general assembly finds that the application of scientific knowledge relating to food is important in the treatment of illness and disease and the attainment and maintenance of health. There are currently no clear means for the public to identify the qualifications of persons providing dietetic services and nutritional care for infants, children, pregnant females, elderly persons, poor persons, overweight persons, chronically and terminally ill persons and fitness enthusiasts. Consumers and patients are becoming increasingly concerned about their diets and nutrition as well as the effectiveness of the information and services being offered to the public. The general assembly further finds that in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, it is necessary to define the qualifications and requirements for persons offering certain dietetic and nutritional advice and services to the public. It is the purpose of this chapter to restrict the use of certain titles to persons who are professionally qualified to use them, thereby ensuring that persons practicing the profession of dietetics and nutrition meet minimum standards of proficiency and competency acquired through adequate training and experience.

      Attorney General Opinions. A physician or registered nurse may be a member of a professional limited liability company (PLLC) “for the practice of electrolysis” only if the physician or the registered nurse holds a license to practice electrology; however, a medical doctor may be member of a PLLC for the practice of medicine and engage, in that capacity, in the practice of activities that would otherwise constitute the practice of electrology and may also employ a registered nurse who is not licensed as an electrologist to perform electrology services under the doctor's supervision and control, OAG 01-002, 2001 Tenn.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly recognizes the need for a person to have the freedom to choose the manner, cost, and setting for giving birth. The general assembly finds that access to prenatal care and delivery services is limited by the inadequate number of providers of such services and that the practice of midwifery may help to reduce this shortage. The general assembly also recognizes the need for the safe and effective delivery of newborn babies and the health, safety, and welfare of their mothers in the delivery process. The general assembly, in the interest of public health, promotes the regulation of the practice of midwifery in this state for the purpose of protecting the health and welfare of women and infants. The general assembly recognizes that midwifery is a profession in its own right and that it is not the practice of medicine.

       Health care is a valuable commodity, and the health care consumer needs to make informed decisions when making health care choices. Due to the current trends in health care, patients have a close relationship with their health care provider and must depend on the provider for most of their health care needs. Health care consumers need to know as much as possible before committing their health care to such provider. Likewise current trends make decisions about which managed care organizations to choose equally important to health care consumers. Because of the foregoing reasons and because of the increasing concerns over the quality of health care, the general assembly finds that a system should be established to provide public access to information about certain health care providers and managed care organizations in this state.

      Amendments. The 2017 amendment, in (a), rewrote the present next to last sentence which read: “The department shall also allow a supervising physician at any time the opportunity to review, accept, and update the existence of a supervisory relationship between the physician and a physician assistant licensed under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c19s63-19-105" target="_self">63-19-105</a></cite>.”, and added the last sentence; inserted “collaborating physician,” in (c); and rewrote (d) which read: “Nothing contained in this section shall repeal or override the confidentiality provisions contained in title 53, chapter 10, part 3, except to the extent that the department uses the information to update the existence of a supervisory relationship between a physician and a holder of a certificate of fitness pursuant to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c07s63-7-123" target="_self">63-7-123</a></cite> or a physician assistant licensed under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t63c19s63-19-105" target="_self">63-19-105</a></cite>.”
