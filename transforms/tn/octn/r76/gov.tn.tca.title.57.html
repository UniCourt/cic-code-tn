       Local option provision of this section was a “condition” within the meaning of the caption of the original act providing for the manufacture of intoxicating liquors “under certain conditions” so that the act was not unconstitutional as embracing more than one subject or as embracing a subject not expressed in the title.

       Provision of this section permitting local option by the counties on question of whether or not such counties would permit the manufacture of intoxicating liquors is not unconstitutional as being a delegation of legislative power to the voters of the various counties since the vote was not for or against the statute as such statute was complete in itself and only its local operative effect was left to the people of the various counties.

       This section is mandatory in requiring the county legislative body to call an election for the purposes set forth therein when a petition is filed bearing the genuine signatures of ten percent or more of the qualified voters of such county based on the number of votes cast in the last preceding presidential election.

        Title 57, ch. 3, is not a local law, in the sense of being passed for the benefit of a particular county only, but is a general statewide law, applicable to the entire state, but effective for its general purposes in such counties only as may adopt it.

        Under the decisions of the federal courts alcoholic beverages retain their interstate commerce character until they actually enter the forbidden state, and if the statutes should be construed so as to prohibit such transportation, they would be void because violative of the commerce clause of U.S. Const., art. 1, § 8, cl. 3.

       <p>
        Where the only act engaged in by defendant which can in any wise be related to these statutes is that of transporting intoxicating liquors from outside the state through dry counties of Tennessee to Mississippi in violation of its statutes, such liquor is not contraband within the meaning of title 57, ch. 3, since those acts are limited to the “manufacture, sale, receipt, possession, storage, transportation and distribution of, and traffic in, alcoholic beverages, in counties and municipalities of this state,” as the purpose of the legislature was to make it unlawful to commit such acts in Tennessee, and not to regulate the liquor traffic in other states.

The Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC) has the power, by necessary implication, to require distillers of alcoholic beverages to report the names of the current corporate shareholders and officers on a form designated by the ABC.  For purposes of reporting to the ABC a change in the stock ownership of a corporation that operates a distillery, there is no provision of law that expressly establishes a threshold percentage change of interest that must be met before the change is required to be reported. Likewise, no provision of current state law exempts any type of distillery from reporting the names of corporate shareholders and officers to the ABC. OAG 18-03, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 3 (1/31/2018).

        The exercise by the commission of powers under this section will not be lightly interfered with by the courts. McCanless v. Klein, 182 Tenn. 631, 188 S.W.2d 745, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 262 (1945); Terry v. Evans, 189 Tenn. 345, 225 S.W.2d 255, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 436 (1949).

        Liquor store in municipality without police power to enact or enforce penal ordinances is still subject to state laws including license revocation by commission for violation of rules. Crabtree v. Stephens, 198 Tenn. 149, 278 S.W.2d 672, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 355 (1955).

        It is difficult to conceive of a regulation of the sale and distribution of intoxicating liquor which could be construed to be beyond the police powers of the state. McCanless v. Klein, 182 Tenn. 631, 188 S.W.2d 745, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 262 (1945); Terry v. Evans, 189 Tenn. 345, 225 S.W.2d 255, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 436 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission is not authorized to promulgate and enforce regulations which are unreasonable, oppressive or discriminatory. Wise v. McCanless, 183 Tenn. 107, 191 S.W.2d 169, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1945).

        It is the official duty of the commission to make and promulgate regulations with reference to the retail sale of intoxicating liquors. State ex rel. Brown v. McCanless, 184 Tenn. 83, 195 S.W.2d 619, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 263 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of the commission under this section to make reasonable rules regulating the issuance of licenses for the retail sale of intoxicating liquors will not be interfered with unless it clearly appears that it has acted arbitrarily or illegally.

   Rule that “no license will be issued to any employee or other person having any interest in the place of business where a license has been revoked, nor will a license be issued to a relative of any employee or other person having any interest in the business for the privilege of doing business near the location of the establishment whose license was revoked,” is not too unreasonable to be sustained and is not unenforceable because of the prohibition of the relative doing business “near” the location of the closed establishment. McCanless v. State, 181 Tenn. 308, 181 S.W.2d 154, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 375, <cite class="alr">153 A.L.R. 832</cite> (1944).

        Regulation forbidding issuance of license where premises occupied by licensee would be in too close proximity to “church, school, or public institution” is reasonable. State ex rel. Brown v. McCanless, 184 Tenn. 83, 195 S.W.2d 619, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 263 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where regulation of commission prohibited issuance of license if premises involved were in too close proximity to a school, the refusal of commission to issue license to liquor store operated within 700 feet of college campus was not arbitrary or unreasonable and was not affected by city ordinance forbidding maintenance of a liquor store within 600 feet of a college campus. State ex rel. Brown v. McCanless, 184 Tenn. 83, 195 S.W.2d 619, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 263 (1946).

        A rule regulating the transportation of whiskey within the state's borders to the end that it may not be diverted and sold in violation of the state statute is a reasonable exercise of administrative authority by the commission.

        Rule of commission requiring bond and description of cargo before any person can transport alcoholic beverages within, into, through, or from the state of Tennessee issued pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) was a reasonable rule required for proper administration and enforcement of this chapter.

       <p>
        If there is a conflict between the municipal and state regulations, that impose by the latter will prevail, since by this section the final authority to license the sale of intoxicating liquor is in the commission.

        The licensing authorities are vested with a large discretion in issuing licenses and their decisions will not be interfered with unless it clearly appears that they have acted arbitrarily or unreasonably.

       <p>
        The refusal of the commission to grant licenses to the wives of men whose licenses had been revoked where it appeared that wives knew nothing about the liquor business and that the business would be dominated by the husbands was not an abuse of discretion. State ex rel. Nixon v. McCanless, 176 Tenn. 352, 141 S.W.2d 885, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 125 (1940).

        An incorporated town of over 1,000, is a municipality under this section with power to license operation of liquor store in its boundaries, even though it does not have police power to enact or enforce penal ordinances.

        Assuming that he is without fault, the holder of a permit issued by the express authority of a legislative act is the holder of a lawfully conferred privilege in the exercise of which he is entitled to protection for the period of his permit. Wise v. McCanless, 183 Tenn. 107, 191 S.W.2d 169, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of a duly licensed dealer to protest an unreasonable, oppressive or discriminatory regulation does not rest on a fundamental property right, but on a privilege expressly conferred by the state, acting through the legislature, and the permission thus given for a fixed term may not be so unreasonably regulated, in the exercise by the commission of the powers delegated to it, as to destroy this permit altogether. Wise v. McCanless, 183 Tenn. 107, 191 S.W.2d 169, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although under this section a dealer has no “property right” in his license, such civil right as he does have under the permit issued to him by the express authority of the statute may be protected against invasion by the operation of a regulation unreasonable and oppressive in its application to him. Wise v. McCanless, 183 Tenn. 107, 191 S.W.2d 169, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1945).

        Where after issuance of license to complainant commission promulgated a regulation prohibiting operation of a liquor store within 100 feet of any place where the public was admitted and liquor consumed, complainant whose liquor store was within 100 feet of such a place and who had no control over such place was entitled to enjoin enforcement of such regulation during the period for which his license was issued.

   Attorney General Opinions. Because a county previously approved liquor-by-the-drink sales through a county-wide referendum, this referendum made such sales legal within a city meeting the definition of a municipality under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c03s57-3-101" target="_self">57-3-101</a></cite>; further, the exclusion of certain municipalities from the effects of a county-wide referendum as described in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c03s57-3-106ol1g1" target="_self">57-3-106(g)(1)</a></cite> did not apply to the city because its population is, and always has been, smaller than the least populous county according to the 1960 and subsequent censuses, OAG 02-092 (8/28/02).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though sales of liquor by the drink were legal in a city, as a result of a previous county referendum, the voters of the city could, through a referendum, prohibit such sales, OAG 02-092 (8/28/02).
      </p>

        A municipal ordinance prohibiting the sale of and trafficking in alcoholic beverages within the corporate limits was in conflict with the requuirement that the sale of alcoholic beverage be permitted or prohibited on a countywide basis. Lakewood v. Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Com., 219 Tenn. 510, 410 S.W.2d 897, 1967 Tenn. LEXIS 452 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance is unreasonable if it is so restrictive with respect to permissible locations of liquor stores that it conflicts with the legislative purpose that such stores be fairly distributed throughout the city. Chattanooga v. Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Com., 525 S.W.2d 470, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 658 (Tenn. 1975).

         For the retail sale of alcoholic spirituous beverages, including beer and malt beverages, as in this chapter defined, a license may be approved for transfer and reissued as herein provided. New licenses shall only be issued for jurisdictions that first approve the retail sale of alcoholic spirituous beverages by local option election conducted under § 57-3-106 after April 1, 2018, or to applicants who have filed applications prior to April 20, 2018. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, in all instances, any person, firm, or corporation desiring to sell alcoholic spirituous beverages, including beer and malt beverages, to patrons or customers, in sealed packages only, and not for consumption on the premises except for conducting tastings pursuant to § 57-3-404(h)(2), shall first acquire the right to purchase an existing license, from an existing licensee and then make application to the commission for the transfer of such existing retailer's license, which application shall be in writing and verified, on forms herein authorized to be prescribed and furnished, and disclosing the name of the proposed transferor of the license; and the commission may, subject to the restrictions of this chapter, approve the transfer of such retailer's license as set forth in § 57-3-212. If the premises with respect to which the license transfer is sought is owned by a person, firm, or corporation not the applicant, the application shall include the name and address of the owner. If the ownership of the premises should change after a license is granted, the licensee shall, within ten (10) days after becoming aware of such change in ownership, notify the commission in writing of the name and address of the new owner.

           It is the intent of the general assembly to distinguish between licenses authorized generally under this title and those specifically authorized under this section. Because licenses granted under this section include the retail sale of liquor, spirits and high alcohol content beer which contain a higher alcohol content than those contained in wine or beer, as defined in § 57-5-101(b), it is in the interest of this state to maintain a higher degree of oversight, control and accountability for individuals involved in the ownership, management and control of licensed retail premises. For these reasons, it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of this state to require all licensees to be residents of this state as provided herein and the commission is authorized and instructed to prescribe such inspection, reporting and educational programs as it shall deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that the laws, rules and regulations governing such licensees are observed.

   Liquor retailer residency requirements in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c03s57-3-204" target="_self">57-3-204</a></cite> violated the Dormant Commerce Clause as the Commerce Clause limited state alcohol regulations, and the durational residency requirements (DRR) were discriminatory on their face; the Twenty-first Amendment did not authorize states to impose DRR on the owners of liquor retailers and wholesalers as they were not inherent to a legitimate three-tier system, and DRR discriminated against nonresidents by creating a barrier to entering the Tennessee retail liquor market and favored Tennessee interests at the expense of interstate commerce.

Byrd v. Tenn. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers Ass'n,   — F.3d —, 2018 FED App. 0035P, 2018 FED App. 35P, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 4081 (6th Cir. Feb. 21, 2018).

   Two-year residency requirement for retail license applicants violates the Commerce Clause because not only is the requirement ill suited to promote responsible sales and consumption practices, an interest the United States Supreme Court recognizes as legitimate, but there are obvious alternatives that better serve that goal without discriminating against nonresidents; the State remains free to monitor the practices of retailers and to take action against those who violate the law. Tenn. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers Ass'n v. Thomas, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">139 S. Ct. 2449</cite>, — L. Ed. 2d —, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4399 (June 26, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         <p>
   Because the predominant effect of the 2-year residency requirement for retail license applicants is simply to protect the Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association's members from out-of-state competition and has little relationship to public health and safety, that provision violates the Commerce Clause and is not saved by U.S. Const. amend. 21, § 2; the 2-year durational-residency requirement plainly favors Tennesseans over nonresidents. Tenn. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers Ass'n v. Thomas, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">139 S. Ct. 2449</cite>, — L. Ed. 2d —, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4399 (June 26, 2019).

        <p>
         <p>
   Two-year residency requirement for retail license applicants violates the Commerce Clause because it expressly discriminates against nonresidents and has at best a highly attenuated relationship to public health or safety; the 2-year residency requirement poorly serves the goal of enabling the State to ensure that only law-abiding and responsible applicants receive licenses, and it is not needed to enable the State to maintain oversight over liquor store operators.

   Liquor retailer residency requirements in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c03s57-3-204" target="_self">57-3-204</a></cite> violated the Dormant Commerce Clause as the Commerce Clause limited state alcohol regulations, and the durational residency requirements (DRR) were discriminatory on their face; the Twenty-first Amendment did not authorize states to impose DRR on the owners of liquor retailers and wholesalers as they were not inherent to a legitimate three-tier system, and DRR discriminated against nonresidents by creating a barrier to entering the Tennessee retail liquor market and favored Tennessee interests at the expense of interstate commerce.

Byrd v. Tenn. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers Ass'n,   — F.3d —, 2018 FED App. 0035P, 2018 FED App. 35P, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 4081 (6th Cir. Feb. 21, 2018).

   Two-year residency requirement for retail license applicants violates the Commerce Clause because not only is the requirement ill suited to promote responsible sales and consumption practices, an interest the United States Supreme Court recognizes as legitimate, but there are obvious alternatives that better serve that goal without discriminating against nonresidents; the State remains free to monitor the practices of retailers and to take action against those who violate the law. Tenn. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers Ass'n v. Thomas, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">139 S. Ct. 2449</cite>, — L. Ed. 2d —, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4399 (June 26, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         <p>
   Because the predominant effect of the 2-year residency requirement for retail license applicants is simply to protect the Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association's members from out-of-state competition and has little relationship to public health and safety, that provision violates the Commerce Clause and is not saved by U.S. Const. amend. 21, § 2; the 2-year durational-residency requirement plainly favors Tennesseans over nonresidents. Tenn. Wine &amp; Spirits Retailers Ass'n v. Thomas, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">139 S. Ct. 2449</cite>, — L. Ed. 2d —, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4399 (June 26, 2019).

        <p>
         <p>
   Two-year residency requirement for retail license applicants violates the Commerce Clause because it expressly discriminates against nonresidents and has at best a highly attenuated relationship to public health or safety; the 2-year residency requirement poorly serves the goal of enabling the State to ensure that only law-abiding and responsible applicants receive licenses, and it is not needed to enable the State to maintain oversight over liquor store operators.

         The certificate prescribed by former provisions of Acts 1939, ch. 49, § 8, was not merely a certificate of good moral character but also a certificate that in the opinion of the officer signing it the applicant will refrain from a violation of the statutes governing traffic in alcoholic beverages. State ex rel. Allen v. Beasley, 182 Tenn. 519, 188 S.W.2d 332, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (1945).

         The certificate of the approval of the local authority was a condition precedent to the issue of the license by the commission. State ex rel. Park v. Beasley, 182 Tenn. 523, 188 S.W.2d 333, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 248 (1945); State ex rel. Harris v. Beasley, 182 Tenn. 529, 188 S.W.2d 336, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 249 (1945).

         Certificate was not only dependent on good moral character of applicant but also freedom from past violation of liquor laws. State ex rel. Allen v. Beasley, 182 Tenn. 519, 188 S.W.2d 332, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (1945).
        </p>
        <p>
         Issuance of the certificate provided for under former provisions of Acts 1939, ch. 49, § 8, was a matter of official discretion, and a refusal based on personal habits of petitioner and past violations of regulations and law was not an abuse of discretion. State ex rel. Park v. Beasley, 182 Tenn. 523, 188 S.W.2d 333, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 248 (1945).
        </p>
        <p>
         The former provisions of Acts 1939, ch. 49, § 8, imposed the duty upon local officials to consider, not only the character of the nominal applicant, but also the moral character, history and reasonably to be anticipated conduct of his past and avowedly prospective authorized agent in sole actual charge and conduct of the liquor business proposed to be transacted.

         The certificate prescribed by former provisions of Acts 1939, ch. 49, § 8, was not merely a certificate of good moral character but also a certificate that in the opinion of the officer signing it the applicant will refrain from a violation of the statutes governing traffic in alcoholic beverages.

        <p>
         Issuance of the certificate provided for under former provisions of Acts 1939, ch. 49, § 8, was a matter of official discretion, and a refusal based on personal habits of petitioner and past violations of regulations and law was not an abuse of discretion.

        <p>
         The former provisions of Acts 1939, ch. 49, § 8, imposed the duty upon local officials to consider, not only the character of the nominal applicant, but also the moral character, history and reasonably to be anticipated conduct of his past and avowedly prospective authorized agent in sole actual charge and conduct of the liquor business proposed to be transacted.

The individual shall demonstrate that the individual meets the following requirements:“(1)  Is at least twenty-one (21) years of age;“(2)  Has had a background check done pursuant to §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c03s57-3-224ol1d" target="_self">57-3-224(d)</a></cite> to ensure the individual has not been convicted of any crime involving the sale or distribution of alcohol within the previous eight (8) years or has not been convicted of any felony within the previous five (5) years; and“(3)  Has a valid driver license.“(c)  Each individual applying for a license under this section shall pay to the commission a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). Each delivery employee license shall be valid for a period of five (5) years.“(d)  If an applicant does not meet the requirements of subsection (b), but is otherwise eligible for a delivery employee permit, then the applicant's application shall be initially denied pursuant to this subsection (d). Within thirty (30) days of such initial denial, the applicant may request a hearing to be held pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5. At such hearing, the administrative law judge or hearing officer may consider any evidence the administrative law judge or hearing officer deems relevant to the matter and may, if in the administrative law judge's or hearing officer's judgment the principles of equity require, approve the application and grant the delivery employee permit, notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (b).“(e)  If an applicant does not request a hearing pursuant to subsection (d) within the required period, then the application's denial will be final and the applicant shall not reapply for a delivery employee permit until five (5) years from the application's final denial. If a person applies for a delivery employee permit in violation of this subsection (e), then such application shall be denied and subsection (d) shall not apply.“(f)  If the administrative law judge, hearing officer, or commission denies an application at a hearing held pursuant to subsection (d), then the application's denial will be final and the applicant shall not reapply for a delivery employee permit until five (5) years from the application's final denial. If a person applies for a delivery employee permit in violation of this subsection (f), then such application shall be denied and subsection (d) shall not apply.“(g)  If a person is convicted of an offense described in subdivision (b)(2) after being issued a delivery employee permit pursuant to this section, the commission may institute proceedings to revoke the person's employee permit pursuant to §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c03s57-3-214" target="_self">57-3-214</a></cite>; provided, that the administrative law judge or hearing officer may, if in the administrative law judge's or hearing officer's judgment the principles of equity require, refuse to revoke the person's delivery employee permit, notwithstanding a finding that the person has been convicted of an offense described in subdivision (b)(2). If the administrative law judge, hearing officer, or commission revokes a delivery employee permit pursuant to this subsection (g), then the applicant shall not reapply for a delivery employee permit until five (5) years from the revocation. If a person applies for a delivery employee permit in violation of this subsection (g), then such application shall be denied and subsection (d) shall not apply.”

         The public policy of this state is to prevent minors from purchasing, possessing, or imbibing alcoholic beverages. Brookins v. Round Table, Inc., 624 S.W.2d 547, 1981 Tenn.

         A person who has the capacity and judgment to act responsibly in his own behalf cannot recover damages where he actively contributes to the intoxication of another and the intoxication is the proximate cause of the injury that is the subject of the legal action. Brookins v. Round Table, Inc., 624 S.W.2d 547, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 503 (Tenn. 1981), superseded by statute as stated in, Biscan v. Brown, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 875 (Tenn. Ct.

         The owner or operator of an establishment selling alcoholic beverages by-the-drink to the public may only be held liable for injuries proximately caused by serving alcoholic beverages to a person who is visibly intoxicated at the time the alcoholic beverages are served. Mitchell v. Ketner, 54 Tenn. App. 656, 393 S.W.2d 755, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 165 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964), superseded by statute as stated in, Worley v. Weigel's, — S.W.2d —, 1994 Tenn.

        </p>
        <p>
         In a wrongful death action predicated upon a common law dram shop cause of action, it will rarely be appropriate for the trial court to grant a summary judgment for the defendant owner of the establishment selling alcoholic beverages by-the-drink where the person causing the fatal accident had been served alcoholic beverages immediately prior to the accident. Knapp v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 682 S.W.2d 936, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3430 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).

        <p>
         The sale of alcoholic beverages by any licensee or other person who is visibly intoxicated makes the seller guilty of negligence per se and where injury results such negligence per se must be a proximate cause of the injury to be actionable. Kirksey v. Overton Pub, Inc., 739 S.W.2d 230, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2792 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
        </p>

   Though the furnishing of intoxicants in violation of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-203" target="_self">57-4-203</a></cite> may be the proximate cause of an injury resulting from intoxication, yet even if that is the proximate cause, the plaintiff's action is barred nonetheless if he is guilty of proximate contributory negligence. Kirksey v. Overton Pub, Inc., 739 S.W.2d 230, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2792 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         In an action by a minor plaintiff for injuries suffered in an auto accident against a restaurant that was guilty of negligence per se for serving her alcohol shortly before she drove, the plaintiff would be treated as an adult, and the fact that she was negligent per se in purchasing and consuming the beverages and in driving while intoxicated did not mean she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. In order to prevail, the restaurant had to show that plaintiff's negligence proximately caused or contributed to her injuries. Cook v. Spinnaker's of Rivergate, Inc., 878 S.W.2d 934, 1994 Tenn. LEXIS 63 (Tenn. 1994), rehearing denied, 878 S.W.2d 934, 1994 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (Tenn. 1994).

         Sections 57-10-101 and 57-10-102 governing the liability of sellers of alcohol, rather than the duties imposed by criminal statutes, determine the civil liability of the seller. Worley v.

        </h3>
        <p>
         The commissioner of revenue is charged with the responsibility of collecting all taxes set out herein due to the state, and in addition to the requirements set out herein, is authorized to promulgate such rules and regulations as will further implement the full collection of all taxes herein imposed:

         <li id="t57c04s57-4-302ol11">
          Tax Collected from Consumers.  The tax hereby imposed shall be collected by the retailer from the consumer insofar as it can be done;

         <li id="t57c04s57-4-302ol12">
          Tax to Be Separately Displayed from List Price.  The commissioner may by regulation provide that the amount collected by the retailer from the consumer in reimbursement of the tax be displayed separately from the list price, the price advertised in the premises, the marked price, or other price on the sale check, or other proof of sale;

            Bond of Licensee.  Every licensee permitted to do business in this state shall, as a condition precedent to the granting of a license, in addition to all other requirements set out herein, post with the commissioner an indemnity bond with good and solvent corporate surety, approved by the commissioner, in an amount equal to four (4) times the average monthly tax liability as determined by the commissioner or in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000), whichever is greater, conditioned upon the proper payment of all taxes for which the sale licensee may become liable. If a restaurant is licensed by the commission under § 57-4-101(i), the bond amount imposed shall be one fifth (1/5) the amount specified in this subdivision (3)(A). The forfeiture or cancellation of the bond, for any reason whatsoever, shall automatically revoke the license granted herein. The bond provided for herein shall run for such time as may be determined by the commissioner.
           </li>
           <li id="t57c04s57-4-302ol13B">
            Certificate of Deposit.  In lieu of a corporate surety on the bond required by subdivision (3)(A), the commissioner may allow the licensee to secure such bond by depositing collateral in the form of a certificate of deposit, as accepted and authorized by the banking laws of this state, which has a face value equal to the amount of the bond. Such collateral may be deposited with any authorized state depository designated by the commissioner. Interest on any deposited certificate of deposit shall be payable to the licensee who has deposited it as collateral, or to such person as the licensee or the certificate may direct.

   Upon thorough review of the language of the statute in light of the statutory framework, legislative history, and attorney general's opinions referenced by the legislative history, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville, holds that the General Assembly's intent in enacting the 1982 Amendment to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a2A" target="_self">57-4-306(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> was to require solely those municipalities that did not operate their own school systems to share liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds with the counties in which they were located.

The Court of Appeals further concludes, however, that this did not necessarily exempt a city from the general requirement of §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a2A" target="_self">57-4-306(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> of distributing one-half of its liquor-by-the-drink revenue in the manner of county property tax distribution.

          Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville, determines that as presented to and adopted in the Senate, the legislative intent of the 1982 Amendment to T.C.A. § 57-4306(a)(2)(A) was to correct a situation in which some municipalities that did not operate their own school systems were failing to distribute the statutorily required portion of liquor-by-the-drink gross receipt taxes to the counties whose school systems they utilized. As explained by the Senate sponsor, the intent was not to require municipalities that operated their own school systems to distribute liquor-by-the-drink revenue to the corresponding counties.

   Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville, agrees that under the plain language of former T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a2A" target="_self">57-4-306(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> (amended 2014), cities a excluded from the proviso of remitting one-half of their proceeds into a county's school fund when the cities operated their own school systems.

          <p>
   Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville, concludes that because T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-103ol1a1" target="_self">57-4-103(a)(1)</a></cite> set forth the effectiveness of the entire statutory chapter in which former T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a" target="_self">57-4-306(a)</a></cite> (amended 2014) was located, §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-103ol1a1" target="_self">57-4-103(a)(1)</a></cite> operated to classify a local political subdivision receiving liquor-by-the-drink taxes from the Commissioner of Revenue as one that had passed a liquor-by-the-drink referendum. The Court of Appeals further concludes, however, that this did not necessarily exempt the cities from the general requirement of former T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a2A" target="_self">57-4-306(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> (amended 2014) of distributing one-half of their respective liquor-by-the-drink revenue in the manner of county property tax distribution.

   Upon thorough review of the language of the statute in light of the statutory framework, legislative history, and attorney general's opinions referenced by the legislative history, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville, holds that the General Assembly's intent in enacting the 1982 Amendment to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a2A" target="_self">57-4-306(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> was to require solely those municipalities that did not operate their own school systems to share liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds with the counties in which they were located. Sullivan Cty. v. City of Bristol, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 834 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2017).

         <p>
          <p>
   Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Knoxville, determines that as presented to and adopted in the Senate, the legislative intent of the 1982 Amendment to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c04s57-4-306ol1a2A" target="_self">57-4-306(a)(2)(A)</a></cite> was to correct a situation in which some municipalities that did not operate their own school systems were failing to distribute the statutorily required portion of liquor-by-the-drink gross receipt taxes to the counties whose school systems they utilized. As explained by the Senate sponsor, the intent was not to require municipalities that operated their own school systems to distribute liquor-by-the-drink revenue to the corresponding counties.

          Pre-2014 local education provision required a municipality with its own school system to expend and distribute half of its liquor by the drink tax proceeds in the same manner that the county property tax for schools was expended and distributed within the municipality, which was for the benefit of the municipality's own school system.

         <p>
          County board of education, which was located in a county in which the voters of the county had not authorized the sale of liquor by the drink within the county, was entitled to recover a share of liquor by the drink tax revenues from a city within the county in which the voters of the city had authorized the sale of liquor by the drink within the city. Specifically, the county was entitled to one-half of the 50 percent (25 percent) allocated by the Commissioner of Revenue for Tennessee to the city. Coffee Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. City of Tullahoma, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 29 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 23, 2018).
         </p>
         <p>
          Because the city has its own school system, the court held that it was permitted to use half of its liquor by the drink tax proceeds for its own school system, and it was not required to share those proceeds with the county or the county schools, and therefore the appellate court erred by reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the city. Coffee Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. City of Tullahoma, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (Tenn. May 8, 2019).

         <p>
          In an action filed by a county against cities based on the cities' failure to share the proceeds of liquor by the drink (LBD) tax proceeds with the county, the court held that the liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute did not require the cities to share half of their LBD tax proceeds with the county and other school systems in the county pro rata, but rather, the local education provision directed the cities to expend and distribute the education portion of their LBD tax proceeds in support of their own municipal school systems. Sullivan Cty. v. City of Bristol, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 175 (Tenn. May 8, 2019).

         <p>
          Liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute did not require the city to share half of its liquor by the drink (LBD) tax proceeds with the county and other school systems in the county pro rata, but rather, the local education provision directed the city to expend and distribute the education portion of its LBD tax proceeds in support of its own municipal school system, and therefore the appellate court properly reversed the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the county.

         <p>
          Liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute did not require the city to share half of its liquor by the drink (LBD) tax proceeds with the county and other school systems in the county pro rata, but rather, the local education provision directed the city to expend and distribute the education portion of its LBD tax proceeds in support of its own municipal school system. The court's conclusion applied to all LBD tax proceeds paid to the city, those generated from pre-2002 referendum LBD tax proceeds from private club sales as well as those generated post-referendum. Bradley Cty. Sch. Sys. v. City of Cleveland, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 177 (Tenn. May 8, 2019).

          Liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute did not require the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue to pay half of the cities'  liquor by the drink (LBD) tax proceeds directly to the county trustee and that the cities were not required to distribute half of their LBD tax proceeds pro rata among the county school system and the other school systems in the county, but rather, the local education provision directed the cities to expend and distribute the education portion of their LBD tax proceeds in support of their own municipal school systems.

         <p>
          County's argument that if the cities were not required to share their liquor by the drink (LBD) tax proceeds under this section then the county was not required to share its LBD tax proceeds from sales at private clubs with the cities was rejected because the disparity was understandable, because the citizens of the cities were necessarily also citizens of the county, but the citizens of the county that lived outside the cities were not citizens of the cities.

        This chapter does not confer an absolute right on everyone to sell beer, but restricts it to those who obtain permits to pay the required tax. McHenry v. State, 168 Tenn. 667, 80 S.W.2d 655, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof is on the defendant charged with selling intoxicating liquor to show that liquor sold constitutes “beer or other like beverage.” McHenry v. State, 168 Tenn. 667, 80 S.W.2d 655, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        This chapter is in the nature of a local option law in that the legislature intended that each municipality looking to the morals and general welfare of its citizens should have a wide discretion not only regulating the traffic in beer but in determining to whom licenses should be issued for that purpose. Cravens v. Storie, 175 Tenn. 285, 133 S.W.2d 609, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1939).

        This chapter is dual in character in that it is both a police power measure and a revenue measure. Henderson v. Grundy County Beer Committee, 176 Tenn. 397, 141 S.W.2d 901, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 130 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this section expressly legalizes the receipt and possession of beer subject to the regulations of this chapter and this chapter prescribes no regulations for the receipt and possession thereof, such receipt and possession cannot be considered illegal.

        The beer statutes do not confer absolute rights but are conditional and in effect are local option statutes. Grubb v. Morristown, 185 Tenn. 114, 203 S.W.2d 593, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (1947); State ex rel. Camper v. Pollard, 189 Tenn. 86, 222 S.W.2d 374, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1949), superseded by statute as stated in, Howard v. Willocks, 525 S.W.2d 132, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 652 (Tenn. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The business of selling beer is subject to unlimited restrictions and such restrictions even to the extent of a prohibition are not “unreasonably oppressive,” or discriminatory, and do not violate any civil right of beer licensees. Grubb v. Morristown, 185 Tenn. 114, 203 S.W.2d 593, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (1947); Ketner v. Clabo, 189 Tenn. 260, 225 S.W.2d 54, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 423 (1949).

        The statute leaves large discretion to the local authorities in the issuance and revocation of permits. Fentress County Beer Board v. Cravens, 209 Tenn. 679, 356 S.W.2d 260, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1962).

      <p>
       A county that has enacted an ordinance that prohibits the sale, storage, or manufacture of beer within 2,000 feet of a church, school, or other place of public gathering may amend the ordinance to protect the beer permits of businesses that have places of public gathering built within 2,000 feet of their premises after the issuance of their beer permits, although such an amendment is probably unnecessary, OAG 02-061 (5/8/02).

      <p>
       If a county legislative body had passed a resolution prohibiting the issuance of a beer permit for locations within two thousand feet of schools, churches, or other places of public gathering, and later issued permits in violation of such distance requirement, could not at a later date readopt such a distance restriction, the effect of which would basically grandfather all such permits without revoking all permits issued in violation of the earlier adopted distance, OAG 04-012 (2/03/04).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county legislative body may adopt a distance requirement of less than two thousand feet by setting the distance at a point which would basically grandfather all permits issued in violation of an earlier two thousand foot distance, OAG 04-012 (2/03/04).

        Since this chapter confers express authority on cities and towns to pass proper ordinances governing the issuance of licenses and also provides express provisions for such cities and towns to impose additional restrictions fixing zones and territories, providing hours of opening and closing and such other regulations as will promote public health, morals and safety in regulation of the alcoholic beverages to which this chapter refers, but only confers on county legislative bodies the authority to regulate the issuance of licenses, the language of the statute must be taken as excluding county legislative bodies from making any regulations beyond the provisions of the statute.

       <p>
        Indictment under this section charging defendant with violation of regulations of the county legislative body with reference to the time of sale of beer and regulation prohibiting sale of beer at a dance hall was improper since under this section the county legislative body only had authority to regulate issuance of licenses for sale of such alcoholic beverages and defendant's violation of the above provisions was not within the scope of such authority so as to permit a conviction for such alleged misdemeanor.

       </p>
       <p>
        The county legislative body had no authority to enact a regulation providing that beer permits should not be issued for a longer period than one year, and a defendant who had been issued a permit without a time limit could not properly be convicted of selling beer without a license where he sold beer more than a year after the issuance of such permit without having it renewed.

        A beer permit will not be denied in every instance where children walk on a public sidewalk in close proximity to a proposed outlet for the sale of beer, since there can be a different impact upon public health, safety and morals from the sale of beer at a tavern, at a family-style restaurant, where beer is sold only to complement food, and at the neighborhood grocery store where small children delight to go.

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        In determining the distance between the place of storage, sale or manufacture and the place of public gathering the distance must be measured in a straight line rather than some other method such as by the usually traveled route or by street lines. Jones v. Sullivan County Beer Board, 200 Tenn. 301, 292 S.W.2d 185, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a beer permit is sought for a restaurant located on a large lot the measurement begins from the building in which the restaurant is located and not from the property line. Ewin v. Richardson, 217 Tenn. 534, 399 S.W.2d 318, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 608 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The distance between a school and the premises involved must be measured in a direct line and not by road, although the latter is the normal method of travel between the two points. Serv-U-Mart, Inc. v. Sullivan County, 527 S.W.2d 121, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 643 (Tenn. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to specifically provide by statute a method of measurement in enforcing beer permit distance ordinances resides in the legislature, not the cities and counties of this state. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether county resolution forbidding the issuance of permits to sell beer within 2,000 feet of any church, school or other place of public gathering had been invalidated by discriminatory and discretionary enforcement, the issue was not whether the present members of the county beer board had discriminatorily and discretionarily applied the 2,000 feet rule but whether the board, as a continuing entity of government, had engaged in such discriminatory and discretionary application. Rutherford County Beer Board v. Adams, 571 S.W.2d 830, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 652 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute and the ordinance forbidding the location of a beer outlet within 2,000 feet of a church applies when the church in question, although within 2,000 feet of the proposed outlet, is located outside the state of Tennessee.

        Restoration of the validity of a distance ordinance which has been discriminatorily enforced can only be achieved by revocation or other elimination, such as attrition, of the discriminatorily-issued permits and licenses. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).

        Discriminatory enforcement of a beer permit distance ordinance cannot be rectified by post facto amendments. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once discriminatory enforcement of a distance ordinance is established, such ordinance is completely removed as a valid ground for denial of a beer permit. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section gives a county discretion to adopt or not adopt the 2,000 foot prohibition, but once the prohibition is adopted it must be uniformly applied and any discretionary application is invalid. Serv-U-Mart, Inc. v. Sullivan County, 527 S.W.2d 121, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 643 (Tenn. 1975); Seay v. Knox County Quarterly Court, 541 S.W.2d 946, 1976 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was evident from the fact that three other establishments retained their license in violation of the rule that there had been “discretionary application” in its enforcement. Seay v. Knox County Quarterly Court, 541 S.W.2d 946, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 561 (Tenn. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of discriminatory application of the 2,000 foot rule is to completely remove, as a valid ground for denial of a beer permit, proximity, measured in feet, to a school, church or other place of public gathering.

       <p>
        This section concedes to municipalities very wide discretionary powers in matters relating to the sale of intoxicating beverages, including zoning and restriction of areas, hours of opening and closing and similar matters. Howard v. Christmas, 180 Tenn. 519, 176 S.W.2d 821, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 317 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The granting of the privilege of selling intoxicating beverages, including beer, in municipalities by state statutes does not preclude municipalities from enacting all reasonable measures deemed desirable for the protection of the morals of its community, even to the extent of prohibition. Howard v. Christmas, 180 Tenn. 519, 176 S.W.2d 821, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 317 (1944); Gatlinburg Beer Regulation Committee v. Ogle, 185 Tenn. 482, 206 S.W.2d 891, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1947); Ketner v. Clabo, 189 Tenn. 260, 225 S.W.2d 54, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 423 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        In all its pronouncements on this chapter the supreme court has recognized that municipalities have very broad powers in the regulation of the sale of beer. Gatlinburg Beer Regulation Committee v. Ogle, 185 Tenn. 482, 206 S.W.2d 891, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1947); McHugh v. Morristown, 186 Tenn. 175, 208 S.W.2d 1021, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 533 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Municipality is not required to issue a beer permit. Ketner v. Clabo, 189 Tenn. 260, 225 S.W.2d 54, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 423 (1949).
       </p>

        <p>
   Amendment to §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c05s57-5-105" target="_self">57-5-105</a></cite>, giving courts the right to review a municipality's refusal of a permit to sell beer through the statutory writ of certiorari, with trial de novo, does not make it mandatory upon a municipality to grant more permits than the city deems advisable. De Caro v. Collierville, 213 Tenn. 254, 373 S.W.2d 466, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the authority given a municipality by this section, the appropriate board may prescribe such rules and regulations as they think advisable; and the only limitations on the power given is that the board must exercise such power in good faith, not in a discriminatory and arbitrary manner. De Caro v. Collierville, 213 Tenn. 254, 373 S.W.2d 466, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (1963); Case v. Carney, 213 Tenn. 597, 376 S.W.2d 492, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 427 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section regulation and control of sale of beer is made a subject of the police power and absolute discretion is given governing body of municipality to effect such regulation and control. Barnes v. Dayton, 216 Tenn. 400, 392 S.W.2d 813, 1965 Tenn. LEXIS 585 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Municipalities are given absolute discretion in the matter of the regulation and control of beer and thus have the authority to revoke a beer license for sale to minors. Richards v. Lewisburg Alcoholic Beverage Com., 543 S.W.2d 852, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 520 (Tenn. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The city had the right to prohibit the sale of beer near a school or church. Memphis Alcohol Com. v. Randall Memorial Free Will Baptist Church, Inc., 550 S.W.2d 657, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 539 (Tenn. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   Municipalities were not affected by the 1961 amendment to §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c05s57-5-105" target="_self">57-5-105</a></cite> and<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c05s57-5-109" target="_self">57-5-109</a></cite> (now §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c05s57-5-108" target="_self">57-5-108</a></cite>) and thus have the continuing right under this section to regulate the sale of beer to the point of prohibition. Thompson v. Harriman, 568 S.W.2d 92, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Terms such as “school” and “public meeting place” that have established definitions by a combination of statute and case law must be given uniform application by the cities and counties of this state in exercising the powers granted them by the legislature to regulate the sale of beer. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to specifically provide by statute a method of measurement in enforcing beer permit distance ordinances resides in the legislature, not the cities and counties of this state. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A city does not have more power than a county to issue licenses, but has more power to place restrictions upon the issuance of licenses. Watkins v. Naifeh, 635 S.W.2d 104, 1982 Tenn. LEXIS 416 (Tenn. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        This enabling statute has been given the broadest possible construction; nevertheless, the broad grant of power to the city fathers to regulate the sale of beer may not be exercised in a discriminatory or arbitrary manner. Pantry, Inc. v. Pigeon Forge, 681 S.W.2d 23, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 879 (Tenn. 1984); Fritts v. Wallace, 723 S.W.2d 948, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 816 (Tenn. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Municipalities have extensive authority to regulate the sale of beer within their boundaries and this includes the authority to limit the number and location of retail outlets, both for on-premises and off-premises consumption. State ex rel. Amvets Post 27 v. Beer Bd. of Jellico, 717 S.W.2d 878, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 794 (Tenn. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   The state has the power to prohibit certain acts involving exposure of parts of the body and to restrict the area where performers may perform in establishments holding a beer license, under U.S. const., amend. 21, and under New York State Liquor Auth. v. Bellanca, <cite class="us_code">452 U.S. 714</cite>, <cite class="s_court">101 S. Ct. 2599</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">69 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 357, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 119 (1981). PP &amp; C, Inc. v. Metropolitan Beer Permit Bd., 833 S.W.2d 90, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 91 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A metropolitan government need only have a rational basis for its decision to prohibit certain acts in establishments selling beer when the same prohibition does not extend to all public places. PP & C, Inc. v. Metropolitan Beer Permit Bd., 833 S.W.2d 90, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 91 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).

        A beer regulation committee created by town ordinance has the power and right to make reasonable regulations for those to follow who desire a permit to sell beer. Gatlinburg Beer Regulation Committee v. Ogle, 185 Tenn. 482, 206 S.W.2d 891, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying a permit to sell beer to a grocery store, based upon the feeling that the morals and general welfare of the city would best be served by limiting the number of permits granted, the municipal beer board did not act arbitrarily and discriminatorily. De Caro v. Collierville, 213 Tenn. 254, 373 S.W.2d 466, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 485 (1963).

       </h4>
       <p>
        Under this statute a zoning ordinance by the city of Maryville which omitted the location of complainant's business from named streets where beer might be sold was not an unreasonable abridgement of complainant's property rights or an unreasonable discrimination against him but was within the provisions of the statute. Madison v. Maryville, 173 Tenn. 489, 121 S.W.2d 540, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the statute a municipality could properly pass an ordinance making it unlawful to store, wholesale or retail beer within 2,000 feet of any school, church or lodge building, and persons holding licenses who were thereby affected had no vested or property rights under which they would be entitled to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance. Cravens v. Storie, 175 Tenn. 285, 133 S.W.2d 609, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        A city ordinance which prohibited sale of beer was not contrary to the provisions of this chapter regulating beer where city by its charter was authorized to prohibit sale of beer and this chapter authorized municipalities to regulate sale of beer. Grubb v. Morristown, 185 Tenn. 114, 203 S.W.2d 593, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        City ordinance prohibiting sale of beer was not discriminatory and did not violate any civil right. Grubb v. Morristown, 185 Tenn. 114, 203 S.W.2d 593, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        A proposed ordinance prohibiting storage and possession of beer was valid under the general police power of the city as it promoted “public health, morals and safety” of the city. McHugh v. Morristown, 186 Tenn. 175, 208 S.W.2d 1021, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 533 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Town ordinance forbidding sale of beer at any point within 5,000 feet of church or school did not suspend the general law on the ground that less beer would be sold and less revenue earned, since statute authorizing sale of beer is both a revenue and police measure, and, furthermore, ordinance in question was pursuant to general law, as this section authorizes county legislature bodies to forbid sale of beer at any point closer than 2,000 feet to a church or school. Rule v. Etowah, 195 Tenn. 634, 263 S.W.2d 498, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 388 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinance prohibiting sale of beer without permit, making sale for on-premises consumption illegal, prohibiting issuance of permit where beer board was of opinion that beer business would cause traffic congestion or otherwise be hazardous to public health, morals or welfare, limiting package store permits to two, prohibiting sale within certain area of city and regulating hours of sale was constitutional. Barnes v. Dayton, 216 Tenn. 400, 392 S.W.2d 813, 1965 Tenn. LEXIS 585 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section vested city with broad authority to limit the number of beer permits, that authority could be exercised only through the enactment of proper ordinances so providing, and absent such ordinance the denial of an application for a beer permit was arbitrary and capricious. Brooks v. Garner, 566 S.W.2d 531, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 554 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discriminatory enforcement of a beer permit distance ordinance cannot be rectified by post facto amendments. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once discriminatory enforcement of a distance ordinance is established, such ordinance is completely removed as a valid ground for denial of a beer permit. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Restoration of the validity of a distance ordinance which has been discriminatorily enforced can only be achieved by revocation or other elimination, such as attrition, of the discriminatorily-issued permits and licenses. Murfreesboro v. Davis, 569 S.W.2d 805, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 629 (Tenn. 1978).

        Contention that this section amounted to class legislation was without merit as traffic in intoxicating liquors, beer and the like may be prohibited altogether, or regulated and restricted in such manner as the legislature may see fit. McClellan v. State, 199 Tenn. 60, 282 S.W.2d 631, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 428 (1955).

       <p>
        Contention that this section as enacted by the 1943 amendment to Acts 1933, ch. 69, was broader than the caption of the original act was without merit after the section was reenacted by the 1950 Code supplement. McClellan v. State, 199 Tenn. 60, 282 S.W.2d 631, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 428 (1955).

Fentress County Beer Board v. Cravens, 209 Tenn. 679, 356 S.W.2d 260, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1962).

        Court, in reviewing actions of boards as provided by this section, exercises judicial and not administrative functions and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Metropolitan Beer Permit Board v. Elkins, 224 Tenn. 237, 453 S.W.2d 769, 1970 Tenn. LEXIS 321 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was competent for legislature to provide for review of actions of board by statutory writ of certiorari and the statutory writ was in no way in conflict with the constitutional writ authorized by Tenn.

        The revocation of a license issued under these sections is not for punishment, but because by violation of the conditions under which the license was issued the licensee shows that he was not a proper person to hold it, and such a revocation does not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to inflict fines or terms of imprisonment on the person to whom the license has been issued and who has violated the law by its misuse. Henderson v. Grundy County Beer Committee, 176 Tenn. 397, 141 S.W.2d 901, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 130 (1940).
       </p>

        Revocation of a license is not intended as a punishment of the holder but to insure as far as possible the decent and orderly conduct of the establishment. Flowers v. Benton County Beer Board, 202 Tenn. 56, 302 S.W.2d 335, 1957 Tenn. LEXIS 363 (1957).

        The power of a county legislative body or beer committee to revoke a beer permit is incidental to the power to grant a permit. Henderson v. Grundy County Beer Committee, 176 Tenn. 397, 141 S.W.2d 901, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 130 (1940).

        Although the notice of the hearing to determine whether the permit to sell beer should be revoked did not contain the grounds for revocation, this deficiency did not require reversal since the licensee's husband had been arrested for the sale of beer to minors in her store and furthermore the procedural safeguards under the statutory writ of certiorari with a trial de novo all but obliterate the necessity of notice.

        Board did not err in revoking license to sell beer where licensee sold beer at a tavern not erected until two years after application was filed. Tucker v. Carter County Beer Board, 191 Tenn. 210, 232 S.W.2d 38, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 566 (1950).

       </p>
       <p>
        Board was justified in revoking beer license on the ground that holder of license had allowed persons to congregate in beer place after legal hours and there was evidence that there were six persons in the place after closing time and drunks had been removed from place on several occasions. Presson v. Benton County Beer Board, 198 Tenn. 489, 281 S.W.2d 63, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 398 (1955).

       <p>
        Where church was established many years after holder of beer permit was granted such permit, action of beer committee in revoking permit solely because permit holder's place of business was within 2,000 feet of church was arbitrary and unreasonable.

        In proceeding to review action of county beer board for revocation of beer permit the proceeding is under the common-law writ of certiorari and only question before reviewing court is whether the board acted fraudulently, illegally or exceeded its jurisdiction.

        Evidence of matters that arose after the hearing of the board revoking license cannot be considered by the circuit court on review, but only whether the record before the board justified the revocation. Black v. Nashville, 197 Tenn. 544, 276 S.W.2d 718, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 314 (1955).

        Action in chancery court to enjoin city and board from appealing decision of circuit court which restored beer license revoked by board, was a collateral attack on judgment of another court which was improper since the proper method for correcting errors of a court is by appeal.

        A county beer board clearly acted in excess of its authority when it tabled an application for a permit in order to consider building setback regulations, and where counsel for the applicant raised his objection in a timely manner when the board took the setback problem under consideration, the chancellor was correct in granting the writ of certiorari.

       A county can reestablish a beer permit distance rule without revoking a permit to sell beer previously issued to a business that does not meet that rule, and the continued existence of such a “grandfathered” permit will not invalidate the reinstatement of the rule or imposition of a new distance rule, OAG 01-157 (10/25/01).

      <p>
       If a county legislative body had passed a resolution prohibiting the issuance of a beer permit for locations within two thousand feet of schools, churches, or other places of public gathering, and later issued permits in violation of such distance requirement, it could not at a later date readopt such a distance restriction, the effect of which would basically grandfather all such permits without revoking all permits issued in violation of the earlier adopted distance, OAG 04-012 (2/03/04).

          The 1943 amendment made an exception in favor of municipal corporations, conferring power upon them to vary the statutory hours of sale, and this exception precludes any such exception in favor of counties and county beer commissions.

           In the event the ruling of the commissioner is favorable to the claimant, the commissioner shall deliver to the claimant the property so seized. If the ruling is adverse to the claimant, or if a hearing is not applied for in writing within the ten (10) days following notice, and the commissioner determines the products to be salable, the commissioner is authorized to order sale of the property in the manner as herein provided, applying the proceeds from the sale first to the costs incurred in the seizure and sale of such articles and the balance, if any, to the state general fund, to be apportioned as tax under § 57-5-205. In the case of any contraband property seized by any law enforcement officer of any incorporated municipality or of any county and turned over by them to the department for confiscation, there shall be paid to the municipality or to the county served by such officer fifty percent (50%) of the net proceeds thereof. Any such beer, other beverages or vehicles so seized and ordered sold by the commissioner shall be sold at public sale by the department of general services, and the procedure to be followed shall be the same as now authorized by law under § 67-4-1021. It shall be incumbent upon the commissioner to notify a Tennessee distributor handling the same brand(s) of beer and/or other such beverages as that seized of such seizure and impending sale. All confiscated beer, suitable for sale at retail, shall first be offered for sale to the Tennessee wholesaler located nearest the site of the seizure engaged in handling the particular brand of beer involved at the same per case price (state beer barrelage tax included) that the wholesaler would be required to pay for such beer at the brewery. All confiscated beer “suitable for sale at retail” not purchased within ten (10) days by the Tennessee wholesaler, after being notified that such beer had been confiscated and was being offered for sale to such wholesaler, then shall be sold at public sale by the department of general services.

          Every distributor or dealer in beer or other such beverages shall permit the commissioner, or the commissioner's authorized agent or representative, to inspect at any time all products, invoices, books, papers and memoranda as may be deemed necessary by the commissioner in ascertaining whether or not the tax levied under this chapter has been paid, or in determining the amount of such tax due.

All persons failing to permit the examination of such products, invoices, books and other memoranda, including the general books, both operating and proprietary ledgers, etc., or interfering with the orderly inspection or examination thereof, or failing to file such reports as may be required by the commissioner, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

         The provisions of this part in regard to confiscation of vehicles used for transportation of unstamped alcoholic beverages, were enacted as a practical, effective means of preventing and detecting fraudulent use of our highways under the pretense of interstate transportation, and the purpose of the legislature was not to control its distribution in adjoining states.

         Forfeiture or confiscation of the vehicle is not automatically accomplished, nor does it necessarily take place at all, but rather the property confiscated is subject to forfeiture “in the manner herein provided.” Wells v. McCanless, 184 Tenn. 293, 198 S.W.2d 641, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 379 (1947).
        </p>

         A vehicle being used for the transportation of unstamped alcoholic beverages through Tennessee is subject to confiscation notwithstanding the fact that the alcoholic beverages were not for distribution, gift or sale in Tennessee.

         Where person sold unstamped whiskey to officer and officer after arrest of person searched automobile of such person 18½ feet from house, but on another's property, in which the officer found whiskey and confiscated automobile, the search of such automobile was proper. Atkins v. Harris, 202 Tenn. 489, 304 S.W.2d 650, 1957 Tenn. LEXIS 414 (1957).

         Where car was found abandoned at side of road after chase, it was proper for the police officers to inspect and search the car, and liquor found in such car could be used as evidence against it.

         In order to confiscate a vehicle because it is used for transporting or storing intoxicating liquors in violation of law the conditions of the statute must be strictly complied with. Boyd v. Christy, 206 Tenn. 304, 333 S.W.2d 552, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 365 (1960).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (b) of this section does not permit the confiscation of vehicles and other articles merely because found at the place or premises where illegal liquor was stored, but such vehicles and articles of personal property are subject to confiscation only where they are found at such place of illegal storage under circumstances showing that they are being used in furtherance of such illegal operation.

        <p>
         Where no liquor was found in car parked about 50 feet from locked garage in which were found nine 50-gallon barrels of whiskey which could not possibly be hauled or stored in the car, the evidence was insufficient to justify a seizure and confiscation of the car for transporting or storing unstamped alcoholic beverages. Boyd v. Christy, 206 Tenn. 304, 333 S.W.2d 552, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 365 (1960).

        <p>
         Under this section a car is subject to seizure if unstamped liquor is found therein for the purpose of distribution, gift or sale, and the presence of unstamped liquor is prima facie evidence that it is for gift, sale or distribution, but when evidence is offered that the whiskey was not for distribution, gift or sale, the presumption disappears.

         The procedure laid down in this section constitutes the conditions under which the confiscation is accomplished, and the proceeding is conditioned upon compliance with the conditions prescribed. Wells v. McCanless, 184 Tenn. 293, 198 S.W.2d 641, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 379 (1947).

         Seizure of car on charge of use in transporting unstamped liquors did not result in forfeiture where statutory procedure for forfeiture was not followed. Wells v. McCanless, 184 Tenn. 293, 198 S.W.2d 641, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 379 (1947).

        <p>
         Where the commissioner did not comply with the conditions under which alone the confiscation of the petitioner's automobile could be accomplished, in that the petitioner denied the hearing to which the petitioner was entitled prior to a sale, the confiscation of the automobile did not occur and title remained in the petitioner.

         Where sheriff upon seizure of car containing unstamped liquor, failed to issue receipt for property taken to person found in possession and commissioner failed to advertise property taken, and sheriff turned car over to federal authorities who 64 days later turned the car over to the commissioner, the latter was not entitled to confiscate car since sheriff acted for federal authorities and not as agent of commissioner, and statutory procedure required for confiscation had not been followed. Range Pontiac Sales Co. v. Dickinson, 195 Tenn. 228, 258 S.W.2d 770, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 327 (1953).

         Where arrest of defendant was unlawful due to search of automobile without a warrant but defendant made no objection to testimony by state officers, and testified that the defendant transported whiskey in question at time of seizure and that the defendant owned the car in which whiskey was transported, an order confiscating the property by the commissioner was valid.

         The requirement of this section that a person selling a car or otherwise acquiring a claim against it make the specified inquiry to the designated officials before the seller shall be entitled to recover such car where it is seized under the provisions of the statute is mandatory. Dolen v. State, 181 Tenn. 31, 178 S.W.2d 387, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 342 (1944); McQueen v. McCanless, 182 Tenn. 453, 187 S.W.2d 630, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 241 (1945).

         Lienors of automobiles confiscated when the drivers were found to be transporting unstamped liquor were not entitled to repossession of the automobiles where they had failed to make the inquiry of the designated officials required by this section. Dolen v. State, 181 Tenn. 31, 178 S.W.2d 387, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 342 (1944).

         Holder of chattel mortgage on truck confiscated because it was being used for transportation of unstamped liquor was not entitled to recover the truck where the holder only made inquiry of constable and did not inquire of sheriff or other principal law enforcement officer. McQueen v. McCanless, 182 Tenn. 453, 187 S.W.2d 630, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 241 (1945).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not necessary that claimant make inquiry at the offices of each of the law enforcement officials listed in the statute since the listing of such officials is disjunctive rather than conjunctive. General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Atkins, 204 Tenn. 700, 325 S.W.2d 270, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 329 (1959).

         Confiscated automobile was properly restored to purchaser of conditional sales notes and conditional sales contract where purchaser made inquiry of federal alcoholic tax unit and was informed that neither buyer nor her husband had any record of liquor law violations, even though purchaser made no inquiry of other law enforcement agencies listed in the statute. General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Atkins, 204 Tenn. 700, 325 S.W.2d 270, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 329 (1959).

        <p>
         Where automobile was purchased in Kentucky under conditional sales contract by Tennessee residents, and Kentucky statute did not require inquiry as to purchaser's reputation for dealing in contraband liquor, this section would not preclude Kentucky finance company from satisfying its lien where automobile was confiscated in Tennessee for violation of Tennessee liquor laws. Boyd v. Interstate Acceptance Corp., 205 Tenn. 458, 326 S.W.2d 911, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 383 (1959).

         Plainly the prohibition of this section against interference by the courts relates to cases where the liquors or the vehicle have been seized, and no court is to interfere with his jurisdiction in such cases when jurisdiction has attached.

         The sole remedy provision of this section necessarily contemplated only those cases in which the commissioner (now commission) retained possession of the property while right to confiscation was being litigated. Brooks v. McCoy, 192 Tenn. 586, 241 S.W.2d 579, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 305 (1951).

         When the commissioner (now commission) illegally surrenders possession while the cause is pending a hearing on a claimant's petition, it necessarily follows that a replevin suit by the owner of the car against a third person illegally in possession is not an interference with the jurisdiction of the commissioner as he surrendered jurisdiction by surrendering possession before confiscation was complete, and under these circumstances, the exclusive remedy provisions of this section are not applicable.

   Determination that the insurer of a bar was liable under its liquor liability policy for the death of the claimant was appropriate because the allegations were sufficient to given notice that the claimant's wife was claiming that her husband sustained injuries as a result of the selling, serving, or furnishing of any alcoholic beverage. Additionally, the liquor liability policy did not extend only to instances included within the Dram Shop Act (Act), T.C.A. §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c10s57-10-101" target="_self">57-10-101</a></cite> to<cite class="octn"><a href="#t57c10s57-10-102" target="_self">57-10-102</a></cite> because the policy language contained no reference to the Act; moreover, by failing to defend the lawsuit, the insurer was bound by the finding of liability against the bar.
