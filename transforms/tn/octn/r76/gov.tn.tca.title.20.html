       By both statute and judicial interpretation, the person for whose use the suit is brought is the real complainant of record, and, in chancery, is the real complainant in fact, and while technically a suit on any of the bonds mentioned in state for the use of the party aggrieved, nevertheless the practice of suing directly in the name of the real complainant, and not in the name of the state, has long prevailed, and been directly sanctioned by the supreme court of the state.

       A minor, who has not left the father's home, but has remained as a member of the family, and, out of his wages which his father has permitted him to earn and receive, has contributed to the family expenses through voluntary gifts to his mother, but has not paid for meals or lodging as a boarder, and has never been formally set free by his father, is not completely emancipated, so as to bar a suit by the father for loss of his services caused by injury. Memphis Steel Const. Co. v. Lister, 138 Tenn. 307, 197 S.W. 902, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 35, L.R.A. (n.s.) 1918B406 (1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the emancipation of a minor is complete, the father's right to maintain an action for loss of services due to injuries is cut off, the act affecting the entire unspent period of minority and being one that is not revocable at the father's instance. Memphis Steel Const. Co. v. Lister, 138 Tenn. 307, 197 S.W. 902, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 35, L.R.A. (n.s.) 1918B406 (1917).

       A mother of a married infant son has no right to bring action to recover damages for his wrongful death, since the right to bring such action is in the widow of decedent as his representative, where decedent was not at the time of the fatal accident and death a member of his mother's family. McWhorter v. Gibson, 19 Tenn. App. 152, 84 S.W.2d 108, 1935 Tenn. App. LEXIS 27 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1935).

      <p>
       Where an accident occurred in Alabama, resulting in the death of a 19 year old husband, it was presumed in absence of a showing to the contrary that the Alabama law was the same as Tennessee law and decedent's mother is not entitled to sue, in Tennessee, for damages for the death of her such infant married son in Tennessee, but decedent's wife has the right to sue to recover damages for his death.

       Upon a proper construction of this section, the recovery of either parent entitled to sue for an injury to a minor child is limited to the expenses and the actual loss of services resulting from an injury to the minor child, not resulting in his death. Tennessee Cent. R.R. v. Doak, 115 Tenn. 720, 92 S.W. 853, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (1905).

      <p>
       The mother's suit as administratrix of her deceased minor son to recover damages for his wrongful death is a suit in the right of the deceased himself, and, in such suit, an amendment seeking to recover damages for the loss of the services of the deceased during his minority is wholly unauthorized. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Leazer, 119 Tenn. 1, 107 S.W. 684, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the parent may not be able to show by exact calculation the amount of damages resulting from the loss of services of the minor child, the suit of the parent may be maintained, and a recovery, if not excessive, will be allowed to stand. Blackwell v. Memphis S. R. Co., 124 Tenn. 516, 137 S.W. 486, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1911).

       Trial court erred by denying the minor's motion to amend the complaint under Tenn. R. Civ.

        1. Nature and Effect of Statute.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The statute altered the common law rule so that an obligee may now sue the surviving obligors without the necessity of joining the representatives of a deceased obligor in the action, and if one of the defendants die pending the suit his death may be suggested and the caused proceeded with against the survivors. Claiborne v. Goodloe, 3 Tenn. 391, 1 Cooke, 1813 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1813).
      </p>
      <p>
       All joint obligations and promises are made joint and several, and a note joint in its terms is a joint and several obligation, and separate and several suits can be maintained against the makers thereof. Judgment may be rendered against a surety alone. Trustees of McMinn Academy Trustees v. Reneau, 32 Tenn. 94, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1852); Hawkins v. Humble, 45 Tenn. 531, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1868).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the statute makes obligations joint and several so that all parties liable in such obligations are not now in many cases necessary parties, yet they are none the less proper parties. Craig v. McKnight, 108 Tenn. 690, 69 S.W. 322, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1902).

        2. Declaration.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A declaration against the defendants summoned, without noticing those not summoned, is an informal dismissal as to them, and not a discontinuance as to those summoned and declared against. Pollard v. Huston, 75 Tenn. 689, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 171 (1881).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The common obligors on several different bonds may all be sued in one action, though there are others on the different bonds and not on all the bonds, who are not sued, for the bonds sued on are to be regarded as the bonds of the defendants alone. Trustees of McMinn Academy Trustees v. Reneau, 32 Tenn. 94, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1852).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bond of indemnity to secure the obligees “against all claims or suits at law, or both,” is a joint and several obligation, and protects the obligees against suits and judgments for mechanic's lien on the property embraced in the contemplation of the bond. Wilson v. Davidson, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 536 (1877).

       Where a note was executed by two joint makers, and the consideration failed so that there could be no recovery on the note, after which one of the makers compromised the matter with the payee by the entry of a credit on the note, there could be no recovery against the other maker for the balance, where he was not a party to such compromise agreement, which was made without his knowledge or consent.

       A resident, as one of the makers of a note, could be sued by summons in one court, and a nonresident, as a comaker of the same note, at the same time, be proceeded against by attachment and publication in another court; and the attachment was not abatable, though the suit by service of process was still pending.

      <p>
       The liability of partners in joint obligations is both joint and several. Doggrell v. Great Southern Box Co., 206 F.2d 671, 1953 U.S. App. LEXIS 2794 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1953), vacated, Doggrell v. Southern Box Co., 208 F.2d 310, 1953 U.S. App. LEXIS 3054 (6th Cir. 1953).

        1. Nature of Statute.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section relates alone to procedure. Jarnigen v. Stratton, 95 Tenn. 619, 32 S.W. 625, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 137, <cite class="lra">30 L.R.A. 495</cite> (1895).

        2. Joint Obligation — Effect of Misconstruction.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The legal effect of a joint promise, by the makers of a note, in clear and unambiguous terms, to pay, in solido, the full amount of the note, could not be modified by a mistaken belief of the holders and makers that each maker is liable only for a proportional part of the full amount. Sully v. Campbell, 99 Tenn. 434, 42 S.W. 15, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 49, <cite class="lra">43 L.R.A. 161</cite> (1897).

        3. Joint Obligors — Suit and Judgment Against Part.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Suit and judgment against part of the joint obligors or partners is no merger of the obligation, and is no bar to a suit subsequently brought against the remaining obligors or partners, where there has been no satisfaction. Lowry v. Hardwick, 23 Tenn. 188, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1843); Link v. Allen, 48 Tenn. 318, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1870); Sully v. Campbell, 99 Tenn. 434, 42 S.W. 15, 1897 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       A suit against partners may be dismissed as to some and prosecuted against the others. Link v. Allen, 48 Tenn. 318, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1870); Sully v. Campbell, 99 Tenn. 434, 42 S.W. 15, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 49, <cite class="lra">43 L.R.A. 161</cite> (1897).

        4. Notes — Misjoinder of Defendants.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The maker and endorser of a promissory note cannot be sued with a guarantor whose guarantee was on a separate paper, and who was not a party to the note. This rule is based upon the fact that there was no joint liability created by the guaranty, and the suit was a palpable misjoinder of parties. Eakin & Co. v. Burger, 33 Tenn. 417, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1853).

        5. Partnerships.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       If one of two partners brings a suit upon a partnership demand, the defendant may take advantage of it at the trial, under the general issue. Coffee v. Eastland, 3 Tenn. 158, 1 Cooke, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1812).
      </p>
      <p>
       Payee of note executed by partnership could sue individual member without naming other members. Hyman Gratz & Co. v. Stump, 3 Tenn. 493, 1 Cooke, 1814 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1814).
      </p>
      <p>
       If one sued on a partnership demand failed to disclose the names of the other partners by a plea in abatement, judgment might be had against him alone as if the demand were single. Coffee v. Eastland, 3 Tenn. 158, 1 Cooke, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1812); Southern Ry. v. McNabb, 130 Tenn. 197, 169 S.W. 757, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 16, 1915B L.R.A. (n.s.) 761 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action upon a partnership's contract all partners at the time it was made should be joined as plaintiffs, even after dissolution. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Davis, 21 Tenn. App. 663, 114 S.W.2d 830, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       A dormant partner may or may not be joined in suit by partnership and a failure to join him as plaintiff is no ground for abatement, nonsuit or writ of error, such partners being proper but not necessary parties plaintiff. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Davis, 21 Tenn. App. 663, 114 S.W.2d 830, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a contract is made in the name of one partner but for the benefit of all, all should join in a suit thereon. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Davis, 21 Tenn. App. 663, 114 S.W.2d 830, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the partnership occupies, substantially, the position of an undisclosed principal, the action may be by that partner in whose name the contract was made alone, or by all. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Davis, 21 Tenn. App. 663, 114 S.W.2d 830, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a contract is made with one partner in his individual capacity, he must sue alone, although he may, in fact, have been acting for the benefit of his firm. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Davis, 21 Tenn. App. 663, 114 S.W.2d 830, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action on a contract of carriage one who had bought several cows in the shipment under an agreement to show profits equally, was a dormant partner, as the contract was in the name of the other and active partner, and he need not be joined as party plaintiff. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Davis, 21 Tenn. App. 663, 114 S.W.2d 830, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 67 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).

       The statute did not alter or change general rule that individual creditors were entitled to priority from the individual effects of the debtors, and the partnership creditors from the effects of the firm of which he is a member.

       Separate or several judgments nisi may be taken and prosecuted to final judgments against the principal and sureties upon a joint and several recognizance, entered into by a prisoner and his sureties for his appearance at a designated time. Brewer v. State, 74 Tenn. 198, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 232 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper for complainant to bring his suit against the surety alone, without joining the principal, or against any one or more of the parties bound either as principal or sureties. Brannon v. Wright, 113 Tenn. 692, 84 S.W. 612, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       A recognizance, with sureties, for the appearance of a defendant in a felony case, is a joint and several obligation, and a writ of scire facias thereon may issue against the sureties alone, without the principal, and is not, for that reason, subject to a motion to quash the writ. State v. Frankgos, 114 Tenn. 76, 85 S.W. 79, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1904).

       A judgment by motion against a constable and his sureties, upon notice against the constable alone, and a judgment against the personal representative of a surety dying after the motion against the constable and his sureties, is valid without scire facias to revive the motion against such personal representative. Hopson v. Hoge & Lester, 16 Tenn. 153, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 63 (1835).

       In an action against the sheriff and his sureties on his official bond, the dismissal of the suit by the plaintiff as to one of the sureties did not affect his right of recovery against the other defendants.

       Judgment, without satisfaction, against one of three joint makers of a note, taken for only one-third of the amount, upon the mistaken belief that he was not liable for more, though effectual to protect such maker from suit for the balance of the note, did not protect his comakers from suit for the full amount of the note.

       The intervention of new parties as defendants is allowed in equity proceedings or suits in chancery, as well as in actions at law. Hill v. Bowers, 51 Tenn. 272, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 161 (1871); Stretch v. Stretch, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 140 (1874); Speak v. Ransom, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 210 (1875).

       An intervening petition filed in an action at law in the United States district court for the use of a certain other company named therein, was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under the conformity act.

      <p>
       Where a person intervenes as a party defendant, claiming an interest in the property, he must make an issue as to the title or interest, or he cannot have his alleged rights adjudicated, and the only judgment that can be rendered against him in such case will be a judgment for costs. Wilson v. Eifler, 47 Tenn. 31, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1869).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for permission to intervene as a defendant should clearly show the interest of the petitioner in the property, and where the petition states any matter outside of the record, or operates to suspend the proceeding, it should be verified by affidavit. Hunt v. Wing, 57 Tenn. 139, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petitioners merely alleged that they had “equities” in property in litigation which they “believed” belonged to defendant they were not entitled to intervene. Stretch v. Stretch, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 140 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       To enable one to intervene under this section, he must show himself “interested in the subject matter of the suit” and must have an interest in the property itself, a title to it, a lien on it, or a right to its possession, and without such an interest in the property, he cannot come in under this statute. Marlin v. Merrill, 25 Tenn. App. 328, 156 S.W.2d 814, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941); Hamilton Nat'l Bank v. Woods, 34 Tenn. App. 360, 238 S.W.2d 109, 1948 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       That one as a creditor might have a right to attach the property, or to reduce his debt to judgment and have execution levied on the property, is not enough to entitle him to intervene under this statute. Marlin v. Merrill, 25 Tenn. App. 328, 156 S.W.2d 814, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941); Hamilton Nat'l Bank v. Woods, 34 Tenn. App. 360, 238 S.W.2d 109, 1948 Tenn.

      <p>
       Attorney, who was not a party to case and had no interest in case, could not intervene in case because of imputations of fraud against her in the case. Barnes v. Kyle, 202 Tenn. 529, 306 S.W.2d 1, 1957 Tenn. LEXIS 436 (1957).

       Ordinarily, money unearmarked, or otherwise distinctive, would not constitute “property” within the meaning of this section, but, under certain circumstances, where funds derive from a particular transaction and the judgment of the court is invoked as to whether they are subject to garnishment at the instance of a judgment creditor, they are deemed then to be of such character as to permit intervention by an adverse claimant, not a party to the proceeding, demonstrating an interest therein.

     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1a">
       In civil actions where comparative fault is or becomes an issue, if a defendant named in an original complaint initiating a suit filed within the applicable statute of limitations, or named in an amended complaint filed within the applicable statute of limitations, alleges in an answer or amended answer to the original or amended complaint that a person not a party to the suit caused or contributed to the injury or damage for which the plaintiff seeks recovery, and if the plaintiff's cause or causes of action against that person would be barred by any applicable statute of limitations but for the operation of this section, the plaintiff may, within ninety (90) days of the filing of the first answer or first amended answer alleging that person's fault, either:
       <ol>
        <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1a1">
         Amend the complaint to add the person as a defendant pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15 and cause process to be issued for that person; or
        </li>
        <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1a2">
         Institute a separate action against that person by filing a summons and complaint. If the plaintiff elects to proceed under this section by filing a separate action, the complaint so filed shall not be considered an original complaint initiating the suit or an amended complaint for purposes of this subsection (a).
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1b">
       A cause of action brought within ninety (90) days pursuant to subsection (a) shall not be barred by any statute of limitations. This section shall not extend any applicable statute of repose, nor shall this section permit the plaintiff to maintain an action against a person when such an action is barred by an applicable statute of repose.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1c">
       This section shall neither shorten nor lengthen the applicable statute of limitations for any cause of action, other than as provided in subsection (a).
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1d">
       Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to any civil action commenced pursuant to § 28-1-105, except an action originally commenced in general sessions court and subsequently recommenced in circuit or chancery court.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c01s20-1-119ol1e">
       This section shall not limit the right of any defendant to allege in an answer or amended answer that a person not a party to the suit caused or contributed to the injury for which the plaintiff seeks recovery.

       In a personal injury action, where T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> was enacted and effective prior to the running of the general statute of limitations as to certain third-party defendants, the section applied to extend the statute until after 90 days had elapsed from filing the answer alleging the complicity of such defendants in plaintiff's injuries. Graves v. Grady's Inc., 906 S.W.2d 463, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995), appeal denied, — S.W.2d —, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 550 (Tenn. Sept. 18, 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants in a suit for personal injuries based on allegations of negligence and strict liability in tort could not assert as an affirmative defense that plaintiff's employer caused or contributed to plaintiff's injuries and damages, notwithstanding that the injuries were sustained in the course and scope of plaintiff's employment. Ridings v. Ralph M. Parsons Co., 914 S.W.2d 79, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (Tenn. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff filed a negligence action against a restaurant for injuries sustained when a stool collapsed, the actions for strict liability and negligence against the manufacturer and the seller of the stool which were brought more than six years from the date of the injury were barred by the statute of limitations; the enactment of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> after the date of plaintiff's original complaint did not revive the plaintiff's right to assert such claims. Owens v. Truckstops of Am., 915 S.W.2d 420, 1996 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (Tenn. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> can not be used to extend the period in which to file suit against a governmental entity under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c20s29-20-305" target="_blank">29-20-305</a></cite>. The 12 month period in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.29.html#t29c20s29-20-305" target="_blank">29-20-305</a></cite> is a condition precedent to a right of action. Daniel ex rel. Daniel v. Hardin County Gen. Hosp., 971 S.W.2d 21, 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 920 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997), superseded by statute as stated in, Cunningham v. Williamson County Hosp. Dist., — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 645 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with the construction that T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> should be construed liberally, an added defendant's status as a party should be determined, not when the original defendant names the added defendant as an additional comparative tortfeasor in its answer or amended answer, but rather when the plaintiff either seeks to amend its complaint to name the additional comparative tortfeasor as an additional defendant or to file a separate complaint against the additional comparative tortfeasor. Townes v. Sunbeam Oster Co., 50 S.W.3d 446, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 68 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> gives an additional 90 days to file suit against a potential nonparty tortfeasor whenever an answer gives notice of the nonparty's identity and alleges facts that reasonably support a conclusion that the nonparty caused or contributed to an injury, and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> applies whether the nonparty is alleged to be partially responsible or totally responsible for the injuries; therefore, summary judgment was inappropriately granted to the state in a case where a county's answer in a personal injury case relating to the placement of a stop alleged that the state was responsible for the maintenance of the area. Austin v. State, 222 S.W.3d 354, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 434 (Tenn. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> was not applicable in the case against the officer defendants because the officer defendants were not identified in the corporation's answer alleging comparative fault in keeping with Tennessee state law, and the corporation's general identification of “law enforcement” in its answer was too vague to indicate any specific individuals or enable plaintiffs to serve anyone without additional information. Woodward v. City of Gallatin, — F. Supp. 2d —,  2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105568 (M.D. Tenn. July 30, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Argument that T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> should not have applied because the officer defendants were already parties to the suit as John Does failed because John Does were consistently recognized as separate parties from subsequently charged parties intended to replace the John Does. Woodward v. City of Gallatin, — F. Supp. 2d —,  2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105568 (M.D. Tenn. July 30, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 20-1-119 is not a statute of limitations. The phrase “applicable statute of limitations” used in the body of the statute does not refer to the ninety-day period, but refers only to the statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiff's cause of action. Mills v. Fulmarque, Inc., 360 S.W.3d 362, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (Tenn. Feb. 24, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 20-1-119 provides a ninety-day window in which a plaintiff may name a new nonparty as a defendant only if the defendant alleging comparative fault against the new nonparty was sued within the statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiff's cause of action. Mills v. Fulmarque, Inc., 360 S.W.3d 362, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (Tenn. Feb. 24, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Applicable statute of limitations” does not include the ninety-day period and Tenn. Ann. Code § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> does not afford successive ninety-day windows during which a plaintiff may file an amended complaint naming a nonparty defendant as a comparative tort-feasor. Mills v. Fulmarque, Inc., 360 S.W.3d 362, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (Tenn. Feb. 24, 2012).

       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> says that the defendant alleging comparative fault against the nonparty must have been sued within the statute of limitations. Mills v. Fulmarque, Inc., 360 S.W.3d 362, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (Tenn. Feb. 24, 2012).

       Court of appeals erred in affirming an order granting fraternity members'  motion to dismiss vehicle owners'  complaint on the ground that it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_blank">28-3-104</a></cite>, because “a person not a party to the suit,” for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite>, included any defendant previously dismissed pursuant to a written, non-final order under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 54.02; a named defendant ceases to be a “party to the suit,” for purposes of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite>, when the trial court issues an order, whether final or interlocutory, dismissing that defendant.

       Arguments are unconvincing that the statute exists to remedy unfairness and construing the statute a certain way disregards its limited purpose, as accepting such arguments would require the court to read a requirement into the statute that is simply not there.

       Although a literal reading of Tenn. Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> suggests that only a person or entity whose negligent conduct caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injury in a cause in fact sense can be named as a defendant under the statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> should not be construed so narrowly. This statute was enacted in response to the Tennessee supreme court's adoption of comparative fault, and the concepts of fairness and efficiency form the basis of such a system. As such, Tenn. Code Ann. § 20-1-119 contemplates naming vicariously liable nonparties as defendants. Browder v. Morris, 975 S.W.2d 308, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 463 (Tenn. Special Workers' Comp. App. Panel 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff in an automobile accident case was permitted to amend the complaint after the expiration of the limitations period and after the defendant filed an answer naming the driver's employer as an unnamed defendant, to assert a vicarious liability claim against the driver's employer. Browder v. Morris, 975 S.W.2d 308, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 463 (Tenn. Special Workers' Comp. App. Panel 1998).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In a personal injury action, dismissal of plaintiff's third-party claim as time barred was proper even though the defendant did not disclose the identity of the third person in its answer asserting a comparative fault defense; plaintiff had adequate opportunity to discover the identity of the third party in order to amend the complaint within 90 days of the defendant's answer. Soper v. Wal-Mart Stores, 923 F. Supp. 1032, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6145 (M.D. Tenn. 1996).

       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> does not apply to a plaintiff who had knowledge that a third party may be at fault for the complained of injuries long before the defendant's answer to the complaint. Whittlesey v. Cole, 142 F.3d 340, 1998 FED App. 120P, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 7552 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1998).

       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> contemplates that the plaintiff will actually know the identity of the alleged individual or entity to be joined. Brown v. Wal-Mart Discount Cities, 12 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (Tenn. 2000).

       Defendant may not attribute fault to a nonparty who is not identified sufficiently to allow the plaintiff to plead and serve process on such person pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite>, even if the defendant establishes the nonparty's existence by clear and convincing evidence. Brown v. Wal-Mart Discount Cities, 12 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (Tenn. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       To allow a defendant to attribute fault to an unidentified nonparty would not only diminish a defendant's incentive to identify additional tortfeasors, but also would effectively impose a burden on the plaintiff to “defend” the unidentified nonparty. Brown v. Wal-Mart Discount Cities, 12 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (Tenn. 2000).

       A plaintiff's knowledge of the existence of other persons who might be liable for the plaintiff's injuries is irrelevant. Townes v. Sunbeam Oster Co., 50 S.W.3d 446, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 68 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sixth Circuit rejected the notion that the statute applies to any tortfeasor identified in the defendant's answer, regardless of whether that tortfeasor was known or unknown to the plaintiff before the statute of limitations expired, and the Sixth Circuit's view is incorrect. Becker v. Ford Motor Co., 431 S.W.3d 588, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 191 (Tenn. Mar. 7, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Having determined that the interpretation of the statute in Townes v. Sunbeam Oster Co. is controlling authority for all purposes, the Tennessee Supreme Court answers the certified question as follows: a plaintiff may rely on the 90-day savings provision in order to add a previously known potential nonparty tortfeasor to an existing lawsuit even when the plaintiff knew the identity of the potential tortfeasor at the time of the filing of the plaintiff's original complaint but chose not to sue the potential tortfeasor. Becker v. Ford Motor Co., 431 S.W.3d 588, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 191 (Tenn. Mar. 7, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff's ability to utilize the statute to amend its complaint to assert a claim against a non-party against whom a defendant has asserted a comparative fault claim or to file a separate new complaint against such a non-party does not depend on whether the non-party was either known or unknown to the plaintiff when its original complaint was filed. Becker v. Ford Motor Co., 431 S.W.3d 588, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 191 (Tenn. Mar. 7, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of the statute is not restricted to tortfeasors who were unknown to the plaintiff when its original complaint was filed; therefore, the statute permits a plaintiff to file an amended complaint against the tortfeasor named by the defendant within 90 days after the filing of the answer or amended answer in which the defendant first asserts a comparative fault claim against the tortfeasor. Becker v. Ford Motor Co., 431 S.W.3d 588, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 191 (Tenn. Mar. 7, 2014).

      <p>
       Trial court properly dismissed a patient's medical malpractice action as time barred because medical malpractice actions were subject to a one-year statute of limitations, the patient's amended complaint was filed more than one year after the alleged negligent medical treatment, although a hospital's original answer did not name specific physicians or parties who treated the patient, it was sufficient to put the patient on notice that a nonparty caused or contributed to the injuries alleged.

       Where separate independent negligent acts of more than one tortfeasor combine to cause single, indivisible injury, all tortfeasors must be joined in same action unless joinder is specifically prohibited by law. Samuelson v. McMurtry, 962 S.W.2d 473, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. 1998).
      </p>

       Trial court properly granted defendants'  motions for summary judgment and to dismiss because the original statute of limitations, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_blank">28-3-104</a></cite>, had expired, and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite> could not be utilized extend the limitations period against defendants; because the trial court failed to direct the entry of a final judgment when it granted defendants'  motions as to plaintiffs'  first amended complaint, the action did not terminate as to defendants, and since no final order was entered against defendants, they remained parties to when plaintiffs sought to assert claims against them in their second amended complaint.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mere filing of a motion for an interlocutory appeal by vehicle owners of the dismissal of their first amended complaint before filing their second amended complaint did not somehow nullify the trial court's orders dismissing fraternity members because for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c01s20-1-119" target="_self">20-1-119</a></cite>, the members were not parties to the suit.

       </p>
       <p>
        The privilege of issuing a counterpart summons to a county other than the county of suit must be based upon a proper joinder of defendants who are (1) jointly liable, or (2) severally liable upon the same instrument or judgment, and may not be based upon a misjoinder of parties. Rooney v. Callins, 62 Tenn. App. 105, 459 S.W.2d 430, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 255 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).

        The statute is imperative in its terms and only authorizes issuance of counterpart when suit has been instituted against a real, and not nominal, defendant. Yancey v. Marriott, Frisby & Co., 33 Tenn. 28, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1853).
       </p>
       <p>
        In transitory actions it is the service of the writ or summons in the county where the suit is issued which gives the court jurisdiction of the person. It is a good plea in abatement by the defendants by counterpart that the other defendant has no interest in the cause of action, and was fraudulently and solely made a defendant in order to draw the cause of action within the jurisdiction of the court of the plaintiff's county. Yancey v. Marriott, Frisby & Co., 33 Tenn. 28, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1853); Achy v. Holland, 76 Tenn. 510, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party served in a county other than the one of suit, there being no service on another defendant there resident, may raise the lack of jurisdiction of his person by plea in abatement. Citizens' Bank & Trust Co. Bayles, 153 Tenn. 40, 281 S.W. 932, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party against whom the law affords no cause of action is not a material defendant. Western Auto. Casualty Co. v. Burnell, 17 Tenn. App. 687, 71 S.W.2d 474, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the defendant residing in the county where the action is commenced is not a material defendant, then the court in that county where the action is commenced is without jurisdiction over another defendant brought in by counterpart process. Isbell v. Strider, 192 Tenn. 685, 241 S.W.2d 828, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 316 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        A real, bona fide defendant must be duly served in the county where the action is commenced. Rooney v. Callins, 62 Tenn. App. 105, 459 S.W.2d 430, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 255 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a transitory action is filed in a county other than the one where the cause of action arose and the service of original process is on a party that is not a real and material defendant, venue does not lie in the county in which the action was commenced. The court does not acquire jurisdiction over the person of defendants summoned by counterpart process in the face of a motion to dismiss the action for lack of venue. Romines v. K & S Engineering & Contracting Co., 556 S.W.2d 85, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 610 (Tenn. 1977).

        Where summons for two defendants was issued to sheriff of Wilson County and duly served in that county upon one of the defendants, and counterpart summons was issued to Washington County and served there upon other defendant, this was prima facie sufficient to give circuit court of Wilson County jurisdiction over both defendants.

        A counterpart warrant issued to another county, without showing service on the resident defendant, is informal, but the judgment will be valid, and its execution will not be enjoined at the instance of the nonresident defendants brought in by the counterpart process.

        It is sufficient authority to issue a counterpart process to other counties, that the original process has been served on a material defendant found temporarily in the county where the suit is instituted, if he was in such county when the suit was instituted.

        In a creditor's action in attachment against his debtor and an attachment defendant who filed a cross bill as an interpleader, making various other persons defendants as having claimed an interest in the attached fund and paying the fund into court, the jurisdiction of the interpleader lies in the county of a defendant's residence, the debtor and other defendants to be served by counterpart summons in the county of their residences. John Weis, Inc. v. Reed, 22 Tenn. App. 90, 118 S.W.2d 677, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 9 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).

       </h4>
       <p>
        Before summons will be issued to another county, the court will look through the form to the substance of the transaction, to see that the party is a material defendant, and that a judgment is sought against him in good faith. Chickasaw Wood Products Co. v. Lane, 22 Tenn. App. 596, 125 S.W.2d 164, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The true test for determining whether summons may issue to another county is whether the defendant served in the county where the suit is brought is a bona fide defendant to the action and whether his interest in the result of the action is in any manner adverse to that of the plaintiff with respect to the cause of action against the other defendants. Chickasaw Wood Products Co. v. Lane, 22 Tenn. App. 596, 125 S.W.2d 164, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938); Moore v. Gore, 191 Tenn. 14, 231 S.W.2d 361, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 541 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the name of resident defendant's attorney, appears on the back of plaintiff's declaration and on the back of the summons as attorney for the plaintiff, is insufficient evidence to establish collusion. Chickasaw Wood Products Co. v. Lane, 22 Tenn. App. 596, 125 S.W.2d 164, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 61 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate test in determining the validity of counterpart service under this section is the good faith of the plaintiff in joining in his suit a resident defendant having a real and antagonistic interest in the subject matter of the suit. Taylor v. McCool, 183 Tenn. 1, 189 S.W.2d 817, 1945 Tenn. LEXIS 267 (1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party sued by original process need not necessarily be shown to be liable, but he must be sued in good faith, and a plea to the effect that such a party is sued solely to defeat one jurisdiction of its right, and confer it on another, is sufficient to abate the action if clearly sustained by proof. Moore v. Gore, 191 Tenn. 14, 231 S.W.2d 361, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 541 (1950).

        Where, in such case, before a trial, the plaintiff dismisses his suit as against the original resident defendant, it is a matter of abatement, and may be taken advantage of, though occurring after a plea in bar, by a plea in abatement, but not by motion to dismiss. Yancey v. Marriott, Frisby & Co., 33 Tenn. 28, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1853); Turley v. Hornsby, 71 Tenn. 264, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1879); Achy v. Holland, 76 Tenn. 510, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1881).

        If action is dismissed as to sole defendant located in county where suit is filed the court loses jurisdiction of proceeding as to defendants located outside county. Isbell v. Strider, 192 Tenn. 685, 241 S.W.2d 828, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 316 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff's action against a resident defendant cannot survive motions made preliminary to trial, the resident defendant is not a real and material defendant for the purpose of locating venue or the acquisition of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants by counterpart process.

        Under the previous statutes, there was an evil practice of endorsing bills or notes to some one where it was desired to bring the suit, convenient to the holder, and by the use of the counterpart against the maker to draw him to that jurisdiction, which in litigated cases was oppressive, and this statute was passed to remedy this situation.

         This statute compiled is an enlargement, and not a limitation, of the preexisting law as to service of process against corporations, and does not, by implication, repeal or modify the preexisting law on that subject; and, therefore, does not apply to a nonresident corporation having a local office and resident agent in the state and already subject to suit and service of process under the preexisting law, but only to such foreign corporations as engage in business in the state, without such office or agent.

        <p>
         The term or phrase “doing business” does not have and cannot have a uniform and unvarying meaning, but is governed largely by the connection and in view of the object of the statute. There is no room for speculation as to the sense in which the terms “doing business in this state” are used in the statute; this section defines those terms. State v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co., 106 Tenn. 282, 61 S.W. 75, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 163 (1901); Atlantic C. L. R. Co. v. Richardson, 121 Tenn. 448, 117 S.W. 496, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1908).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to subject a foreign corporation to a suit in this state, the foreign corporation must either be engaged in business in this state, or have an office or agents in this state who are the agents in the sense that they are operating and conducting the business of the foreign corporation in this state. Denson v. Webb, 23 Tenn. App. 599, 136 S.W.2d 59, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 92 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).

        <p>
         Where controlling stipulation of facts was not sufficient to establish whether there was a contract for personal services in aid of one of foreign corporation's brokers within the county, determination could not be made as to whether alleged contract related to any transactions had in whole or part within the state. Tucker v. International Salt Co., 209 Tenn. 95, 349 S.W.2d 541, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 351 (1961).

         Charges in complaint of alleged violation of the Securities Exchange Act merit no consideration on appeal, having been given none by either the parties or the judge in the district court. Smartt v. Coca-Cola Bottling Corp., 318 F.2d 447, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4940 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors to be considered in determining whether or not a foreign corporation has so activated itself in the state as to be subject to jurisdiction of the state's courts are: (1) The nature and character of the business; (2) The number and type of activities within the forum; (3) Whether such activities give rise to a cause of action; (4) Whether or not the forum has some special interest in granting relief; and (5) The relative convenience of the parties.

         As a general proposition, a corporation cannot be sued in any state other than that of its origin, unless it is doing business in such other state, and no state has the power to authorize suits against foreign corporations, or the service of process upon them, unless they are doing business within the state. Banks Grocery Co. v. Kelley-Clarke Co., 146 Tenn. 579, 243 S.W. 879, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1922).

         A corporation which has no facilities within Tennessee and has not designated an agent on whom process against it may be served will be deemed to have constituted the secretary of state as its agent for such service if it has made use of the privilege to do business within Tennessee after proper domestication; however, any such transactions complained of must have arisen within this state, and attendant circumstances must have localized the defendant's activities and evidenced its presence in the state.

         In wrongful death action where defendant was Delaware corporation doing business in Tennessee but with main place of business elsewhere and accident causing death occurred in Kentucky and plaintiff had service of process on statutory agent and on person in charge of defendant's local business office, defendant's motion to dismiss on ground that this section limited service of process to transactions arising within state was denied as this was merely a procedural limitation, and this section and Tenn. R. Civ. P. 4.04(4) are procedural alternatives. Gallaher v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 367 F. Supp. 1063, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10476 (E.D. Tenn. 1973).

         As applied to a nonresident association, this section does not infringe upon the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. 14. McDaniel v. Textile Workers Union, 36 Tenn. App. 236, 254 S.W.2d 1, 1952 Tenn. App. LEXIS 110 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         The original act did not violate Tenn. Const. art. II, § 17, providing that an act must not include more than one subject, that subject to be embraced in the title. McDaniel v. Textile Workers Union, 36 Tenn. App. 236, 254 S.W.2d 1, 1952 Tenn. App. LEXIS 110 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a diversity action by alleged fund beneficiaries and coal producer seeking refund of money allegedly illegally collected by a trust doing business in Tennessee, service under the Tennessee substituted service statute upon trustees of trust created by the trust indenture contained in the national bituminous coal company agreement did not violate the due process and full faith and credit clauses of the United States Constitution. Rittenberry v. Lewis, 222 F. Supp. 717, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7196 (E.D. Tenn. 1963), aff'd, 333 F.2d 573, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4991 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not violate U.S. Const. amend. 14 by not requiring, before process is issued, a showing that the defendant has the requisite “minimal contacts” with the state that would authorize the state to exercise jurisdiction over it since the defendant may challenge the sufficiency of the process and the existence of the minimal contacts required by the U.S. Const. amend. 14 and can receive a determination thereon prior to subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of the court. Jersey Farms Milk Service, Inc. v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters, etc., 297 F. Supp. 1098, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9545 (M.D. Tenn. 1969).

        <p>
         Since the purpose of this section, as indicated by the title to the original act, is to regulate the business of unincorporated associations within the state, the provisions for service of process are to be construed as applying only to actions growing out of the conduct of such business within the state. McDaniel v. Textile Workers Union, 36 Tenn. App. 236, 254 S.W.2d 1, 1952 Tenn. App. LEXIS 110 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is only when unincorporated associations are doing business in Tennessee that this section can apply. Spencer Kellogg & Sons, Inc. v. Lobban, 204 Tenn. 79, 315 S.W.2d 514, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 248 (1958).
        </p>
        <p>
         Activity of the trustees, both in the collection and payment of money in Tennessee under the national bituminous coal wage agreement, constituted “minimum contact” to make the trust subject to substituted service of process under Tennessee statutes in suits by pension claimants and by coal producers seeking refund of moneys allegedly illegally collected by the trust. Rittenberry v. Lewis, 222 F. Supp. 717, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7196 (E.D. Tenn. 1963), aff'd, 333 F.2d 573, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4991 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         As amended, this section provides for service of process on “nonresident trusts” and a literal reading would permit the trust entity to be sued as such; however, since the better rule is to require service upon the trustees in suits against a trust, plaintiff who sought such service will be allowed to amend its complaint so as to name the trustees as defendants and secure service accordingly, unless stipulation is made as to service. Rittenberry v. Lewis, 222 F. Supp. 717, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7196 (E.D. Tenn. 1963), aff'd, 333 F.2d 573, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4991 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the national bituminous coal wage agreement, the trust fund had numerous beneficiaries in Tennessee, resorted to court action in Tennessee courts, maintained an area medical office in Knoxville, and sent representatives and auditors to visit applicants and check employers' records; and these facts satisfy the test of doing business in Tennessee within the “substituted service” statute. Rittenberry v. Lewis, 222 F. Supp. 717, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7196 (E.D. Tenn. 1963), aff'd, 333 F.2d 573, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4991 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite this Tennessee service of process statute, which permits service on nonresident trusts, neither foreign nor “resident” trusts are suable as entities, trustees being the proper parties. Coverdell v. Mid-South Farm Equipment Asso., 335 F.2d 9, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4878 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         While it is necessary that an unincorporated association meet three requirements before being amenable to process under this section, e.g., the association must have done business in the state, the cause of action must have arisen out of such business and the association must have failed to appoint an agent for service of process, these requirements are not prerequisites to the application of the section and the plaintiff need not affirmatively establish the existence of these requirements before the statute can be invoked. Jersey Farms Milk Service, Inc. v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters, etc., 297 F. Supp. 1098, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9545 (M.D. Tenn. 1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal rules of civil procedure authorize service of summons on an unincorporated association in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is held (Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(3), (7)); but the capacity of an unincorporated association to sue or be sued in its common name, for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States is determined by the federal rules of civil procedure, regardless of state law (Fed. R. Civ. P. 17B). Jersey Farms Milk Service, Inc. v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters, etc., 297 F. Supp. 1098, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9545 (M.D. Tenn. 1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not require that service of process on a duly appointed resident agent of an insurance association be limited to a cause of action arising within the state. Beautytuft, Inc. v. Factory Ins. Asso., 48 F.R.D. 15, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12775 (D. Tenn. 1969), aff'd, 431 F.2d 1122, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7477 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         The limitation that the cause of action must arise within the state need not be read into this statute. Beautytuft, Inc. v. Factory Ins. Asso., 431 F.2d 1122, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7477 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1970).

         This section was enacted to protect citizens of Tennessee against unincorporated associations of the kind covered by the statute. Spencer Kellogg & Sons, Inc. v. Lobban, 204 Tenn. 79, 315 S.W.2d 514, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 248 (1958).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although under the general rule of the law of trusts the administration of a trust of movables should be supervised by the courts of the state in which the trust is located, one purpose of the 1963 amendment to this section is to render nonresident trusts doing business in Tennessee subject to service of process in the courts of this state. Rittenberry v. Lewis, 222 F. Supp. 717, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7196 (E.D. Tenn. 1963), aff'd, 333 F.2d 573, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4991 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         The 1963 statutory amendment to this section contemplated and was sufficient to accomplish the purpose of regulating the doing of business in Tennessee by nonresident trusts by providing for substituted personal service upon the trustees of the trust fund through the secretary of state, although it literally provided for service upon “nonresident trusts” rather than trustees. Rittenberry v. Lewis, 222 F. Supp. 717, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7196 (E.D. Tenn. 1963), aff'd, 333 F.2d 573, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4991 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1964).

The agency shall continue so long after the expiration of such time as may be necessary to enable the secretary of state to complete the service of process, sued out prior to the expiration of the time and forwarded to the defendant with reasonable dispatch.

         The secretary of state shall keep a docket in which the secretary of state enters the style of the cause, the date of issuance of such process, the date of its receipt by the secretary of state and the date on which it was forwarded by the secretary of state to the person named as defendant in the cause.

         The purpose of the statute is to facilitate the enforcement of civil remedies by those injured in their person or property by the negligent or wanton operation of motor vehicles upon the highways. Ellis v. Georgia Marble Co., 191 Tenn. 229, 232 S.W.2d 45, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 569 (1950).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section is for the benefit of residents of Tennessee and not for the benefit of nonresidents. Bertrand v. Wilds, 198 Tenn. 543, 281 S.W.2d 390, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1955).
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of this section is to better enable enforcement in Tennessee courts of civil remedies available against those liable by reason of negligent operation of a motor vehicle over the Tennessee highways. Leggett v. Crossnoe, 206 Tenn. 700, 336 S.W.2d 1, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 400 (1960); Anderson v. Outland, 210 Tenn. 526, 360 S.W.2d 44, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 314 (1962).
        </p>
        <p>
         The statute was enacted for the benefit of persons injured within the state rather than for the benefit of nonresident motorists causing such injuries. Anderson v. Outland, 210 Tenn. 526, 360 S.W.2d 44, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 314 (1962).
        </p>
        <p>
         The general purpose of the nonresident substituted service of process statute of Tennessee is to subject nonresident users of the state's highways to the state's judicial process in actions arising out of accidents occurring on such highways. Williams v. Kitchin, 316 F.2d 310, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5569 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         The object of nonresident motorist statutes is to provide a method of notice reasonably calculated to afford parties interested in the proceeding an opportunity to appear and be heard. Massengill v. Campbell, 391 F.2d 233, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 7918 (5th Cir. Tex. 1968).

         This statute must be given a strict construction. Ellis v. Georgia Marble Co., 191 Tenn. 229, 232 S.W.2d 45, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 569 (1950).
        </p>
        <p>
         This statute is in derogation of the common law and is strictly construed. Tabor v. Mason Dixon Lines, Inc., 196 Tenn. 198, 264 S.W.2d 821, 1953 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1953).
        </p>
        <p>
         Rule that statute, being in derogation of common law, is to be strictly construed only applies where the statute is ambiguous or open to more than one construction and will not apply where the terms of the statute are clear and unambiguous. Anderson v. Outland, 210 Tenn. 526, 360 S.W.2d 44, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 314 (1962); Williams v. Kitchin, 316 F.2d 310, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5569 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         The nonresident substituted service of process statute of Tennessee must be given a reasonable construction, and one which is in accord with its purpose. Williams v. Kitchin, 316 F.2d 310, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5569 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         The nonresident substituted service of process statute of Tennessee was not intended to cover only “those nonresidents who rent or otherwise obtain the bailment of an automobile licensed in this state but have no other right of ownership.” Williams v. Kitchin, 316 F.2d 310, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5569 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section is not a limitation statute but an appointing statute and the secretary's agency is both created and limited by the statute. Thomas v. Anderson, 222 Tenn. 204, 435 S.W.2d 109, 1968 Tenn. LEXIS 425 (1968); Speight v. Miller, 223 Tenn. 259, 443 S.W.2d 657, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1969).

         “Involved” as here used means something connected with the accident, and if a nonresident has an accident as a result of using our highways, then these nonresidents consent that the secretary of this state is their agent to accept service of process for them for accidents or injuries growing out of using the highways.

        </p>
        <p>
         This section permitting service on secretary of state did not apply where plaintiff was injured while unloading marble on premises of consignee since vehicle involved had reached its destination and accident was not due to travel on the highway but to negligent loading of marble. Ellis v. Georgia Marble Co., 191 Tenn. 229, 232 S.W.2d 45, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 569 (1950).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section applies not only to vehicles upon public highways but also to vehicles on private property. Bertrand v. Wilds, 198 Tenn. 543, 281 S.W.2d 390, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1955); Dixie Feed & Seed Co. v. Byrd, 52 Tenn. App. 619, 376 S.W.2d 745, 1963 Tenn. App. LEXIS 119 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         Accident within grounds of veterans hospital occurred on “highway” so that service on secretary of state for nonresidents was valid. Bertrand v. Wilds, 198 Tenn. 543, 281 S.W.2d 390, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 404 (1955).

         Where plaintiff was injured while unloading cargo of trailer after tractor-trailer had traveled over Tennessee highways and such injury allegedly occurred as the result of defective condition of trailer whereby plaintiff caught his foot in hole of trailer and a tank which was part of the cargo rolled over him, the defective condition of the trailer did not result from use of the highways and service was not authorized under this section. Acuff v. Service Welding & Machine Co., 141 F. Supp. 294, 1956 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3275 (D. Tenn. 1956).

         Service of process on the secretary of state is sufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations, provided the plaintiff uses or has used due diligence to ascertain the whereabouts of the defendant and to serve the requisite notice to make service consummate.

        <p>
         This section validly makes the use of the highways of the state by a nonresident motorist an appointment of the secretary of state as agent to receive process, and the service of that process within the authorized period satisfies the requirement of the statute.

Speight v. Miller, 223 Tenn. 259, 443 S.W.2d 657, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee Nonresident Motorist Statute is not a limitation statute but rather a process statute which both creates and limits the agency of the secretary of state so that his agency to accept service of process begins on the date of the accident and extends for one year in cases of personal injury and three years in cases of damage to personal property. Speight v. Miller, 223 Tenn. 259, 443 S.W.2d 657, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         When the relationship expired, it was not recreated, or revived by the amendment which was not expressly retroactive. Henderson v. Ford, 488 S.W.2d 720, 1972 Tenn. LEXIS 320 (Tenn. 1972), overruled in part, Saylors v. Riggsbee, 544 S.W.2d 609, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 517 (Tenn. 1976).

        <p>
         Where suit was pending when the statute was amended to authorize service of process on the secretary of state for so long as the action is not barred by the statute of limitations, the former requirement that process be served on the secretary of state within one year of the date of the accident was inapplicable. Saylors v. Riggsbee, 544 S.W.2d 609, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 517 (Tenn. 1976).

         In a personal injury action arising from an automobile accident, even though plaintiff was unaware of the fact that defendant was, or had become, a nonresident, where plaintiff had not used due diligence in attempting to locate and serve defendant, the plaintiff failed to satisfy the prerequisites necessary to toll the statute of limitations.

         Service of process, under this section, on defendant, a resident of Texas, with respect to suit for damages arising out of automobile accident in Tennessee, was adequate where registered letter sent by Tennessee secretary of state to defendant was picked up at post office by defendant's fourteen-year-old son and defendant received actual notice from son of pendency of Tennessee proceedings. Massengill v. Campbell, 391 F.2d 233, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 7918 (5th Cir. Tex. 1968).

         The only “service of process” necessary is that on the secretary of state and notice to the defendant although vital, is a separate matter. Vance v. Blegan, 225 Tenn. 282, 466 S.W.2d 223, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1971).

         This section only requires that the summons be “lodged with” and not in a technical sense “addressed to” the secretary of state. Vance v. Blegan, 225 Tenn. 282, 466 S.W.2d 223, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1971).

         Under provision that agency of the secretary of state to accept substituted service of process shall continue for one year from the date of any accident, where suit was not filed until more than a year after the accident upon which it was based, the service on the secretary of state was not sufficient to bring defendants into federal court under rule permitting service of process according to law of state wherein the action is brought.

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         The plaintiff has a duty to furnish secretary of state with defendant's address with due diligence and the policy set out in § 28-105 (repealed), which requires suit to be reinstituted within one year after summons is returned unexecuted so that address should be furnished within one year of last unsuccessful effort to give notice. Vance v. Blegan, 225 Tenn. 282, 466 S.W.2d 223, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where plaintiff furnished secretary of state with defendant's correct address within one year of the last successful attempt to give notice, fourth “alias summons” within such period served as satisfactory exercise of plaintiff's duty to provide with due diligence a correct address. Vance v. Blegan, 225 Tenn. 282, 466 S.W.2d 223, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though “alias” and “pluries” summons are without effect since the first summons is accepted as service, in absence of other statutory procedure such practice serves the purpose of providing the secretary of state with information and indicates plaintiff's diligence or lack of it where the first effort to provide defendant's address is unsuccessful. Vance v. Blegan, 225 Tenn. 282, 466 S.W.2d 223, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 301 (1971).

         This section is constitutional. Darby v. Superior Supply Co., 224 Tenn. 540, 458 S.W.2d 423, 1970 Tenn. LEXIS 355 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a foreign corporation negotiated a demise charter agreement for a vessel owned by a Tennessee corporation, but never physically present in Tennessee, the contract being negotiated solely by telephone calls and correspondence and no representative of the foreign corporation ever entered Tennessee, it was held that, in a suit by the Tennessee corporation under the charter agreement, service of process on the foreign corporation pursuant to this section met the procedural due process of law requirements of the U. S. Const. amend. 14 under the established criteria that the foreign corporation: (1) Purposefully availed itself of the privilege of acting in Tennessee, or causing a consequence in Tennessee; (2) The cause of action arose from the foreign corporation's activities in Tennessee; and (3) the acts of, or consequences caused by, the foreign corporation had a sufficiently substantial connection with Tennessee to make the exercise of jurisdiction over it, under the Tennessee “long arm” statute, reasonable. American Marine & Machinery Co. v. Consumers' Gas Co., 379 F. Supp. 82, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11851 (M.D. Tenn. 1973), aff'd, 495 F.2d 1373 (6th Cir. 1974); Inter-City Prods. Corp v. Willey, 149 F.R.D. 563, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14851 (M.D. Tenn. 1993); Southland Express v. Scrap Metal Buyers, 895 S.W.2d 335, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 509 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where promissory notes bore the notation “Nashville, Tenn.” in their headings and specifically stated on their face that they were payable in Nashville, but were executed and guaranteed outside Tennessee, service of process on the nonresident makers and guarantors under the “long arm statute” in a suit by a holder in due course did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and was not a denial of procedural due process of law under U. S. Const., amend. 14, § 1. Third Nat'l Bank v. Hardi--Gardens Supply of Ill., Inc., 380 F. Supp. 930, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7626 (M.D. Tenn. 1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under federal constitutional requirements, jurisdiction over a foreign corporation may be sustained only if the corporation has certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and there is no invariable rule for determining whether sufficient minimum contacts exist. Ladd v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 456 F. Supp. 422, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15743 (S.D.N.Y. 1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         A court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident complies with this section and with due process where the nonresident has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of acting or causing a consequence in Tennessee where under ordinary circumstances the cause of action arose from the defendant's activities in the state and where the action or the consequences caused by the defendant have a substantial enough connection with Tennessee to make its exercise of jurisdiction reasonable. Carborundum Co., Pollution Control Div. v. Bay Fabricators, Inc., 461 F. Supp. 437, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14735 (E.D. Tenn. 1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         Federal court avoided construing the constitutional limits of “long arm” jurisdiction by transferring an action pursuant to <cite class="us_code">28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)</cite>. Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Michigan Sugar Co., 463 F. Supp. 14, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19158 (E.D. Tenn. 1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section confers jurisdiction to the full extent allowable under the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. 14. Hi Fi Corner, Inc. v. Inflight Cinema International, Inc., 505 F. Supp. 12, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15874 (M.D. Tenn. 1980); Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. v. Moore, 645 S.W.2d 242, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 603 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tennessee long-arm statute extends the jurisdiction of Tennessee courts to the full extent of due process. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Mayberry, 789 F. Supp. 901, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5648 (E.D. Tenn. 1992); Inter-City Prods. Corp v. Willey, 149 F.R.D. 563, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14851 (M.D. Tenn. 1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         When a state's long arm statute authorizes the assertion of personal jurisdiction to the limits of federal due process, as does T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02s20-2-214" target="_self">20-2-214</a></cite>, the issue becomes simply whether the trial court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant meets due process requirements. Manufacturers Consolidation Serv., Inc. v. Rodell, 42 S.W.3d 846, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 148 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).

Agarita Music, 182 F. Supp. 2d 653, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1775 (M.D. Tenn. 2002).

        <p>
         The modern approach to in personam jurisdiction is based on the protection the due process clause provides to an individual's liberty interest in having fair warning that a particular activity may subject him to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign. S & S Screw Machine Co. v. Cosa Corp., 647 F. Supp. 600, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18965 (M.D. Tenn. 1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         The due process clause requires fair warning that a particular activity may subject a defendant to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign. United Agric. Servs., Inc. v. Scherer, 17 S.W.3d 252, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 613 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Employee's consent to the choice of law provisions did not amount to consent to personal jurisdiction in Tennessee, and the provisions did not provide fair warning that the employee should anticipate being haled into a Tennessee court; the employee's activities were directed only at Texas residents, and the only activity directed at any Tennessee resident consisted of communication with other employees. Accredo Health v. Patterson, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 499 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Exercise of jurisdiction over a Texas energy company was fair and reasonable because the energy company did not make the courts aware of any substantive social policies of Texas that would be affected by a Tennessee court's exercise of jurisdiction. Crouch Ry. Consulting, LLC v. LS Energy Fabrication, LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 212 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2019), aff'd, Crouch Ry. Consulting, LLC v.

         A Wisconsin corporation which negotiated a contract with a Tennessee corporation through an agent in Tennessee “transacted business within the state” sufficiently to give Tennessee courts jurisdiction of a suit by the Tennessee corporation for breach of such contract under service of process obtained pursuant to this act. Temco, Inc. v. General Screw Products, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 793, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7977 (M.D. Tenn. 1966).

         A nonresident corporation which licensed a Tennessee manufacturer whose only factory was in Tennessee to manufacture on a royalty basis products for which the nonresident held patents did business in Tennessee as the term is used in this section so as to make this act applicable to an action involving such license even though the contract was executed in New York.

         Tennessee courts are without jurisdiction where, with respect to a suit for fraud in the sale of stock, it appears that all meetings and negotiations prior to the actual sale took place outside Tennessee and where the corporation involved was not a Tennessee corporation and did not have real property in the state and where the seller of the stock was not a resident of Tennessee.

         The facts that defendant advertised his plane in a magazine circulated in the state, called plaintiff in the state and sent pictures to plaintiff in the state does not establish a sufficient basis for in personam jurisdiction against the defendant with respect to suit for damages resulting from the crash of the plane in Tennessee after its purchase by plaintiff.

         Where a foreign corporation was the sole importer of a particular make of motorcycle for distribution throughout the United States and one of these cycles was sold in Tennessee by an independent distributor, the importing corporation neither directly distributing motorcycles in nor doing business in Tennessee, it was held that the Tennessee long arm statute, § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02s20-2-214" target="_self">20-2-214</a></cite> extends to the limits of the due process clause of the U. S. Const. amend. 14, and that, in a suit by an injured cyclist for injuries sustained in Tennessee due to a defective motorcycle imported by the foreign corporation, the corporation, by having set in motion in another state events likely to result in injury to a person and property in Tennessee, subjected itself to in personam jurisdiction and service of process under the Tennessee long arm statute.

         In a diversity suit between Tennessee residents and an Australian airline to recover for financial loss and emotional distress allegedly arising out of the actions of the airline's agents outside the United States, the federal court sitting in Tennessee could exercise in personam jurisdiction over the airline through the use of the long arm statute where the quantity and contacts of the airline with Tennessee, the nature and quality of the contacts and their connection with the cause of action were sufficient to meet the “minimum contacts” test.

         Tennessee may not constitutionally acquire personal jurisdiction over a party without that party's having had certain minimal contacts with the state; however, the causing of a consequence in the forum state by the defendant can satisfy the requirements of the minimum contacts test. Where a corporation causes to be set in motion events in one state that are likely to and do result in injury to person and property in another state, the corporation is amenable to service of process pursuant to the long arm statute of the state wherein injury occurs.

         Personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants was properly exercised where their activities, many of which occurred in Tennessee, consisted of a deliberate course of conduct directed specifically toward a Tennessee resident by which the defendants sought and achieved a continuing business relationship with that resident.

         When a corporation purposefully availed itself of profit making activity by promoting the sale of its products through unsolicited advertisements to potential Tennessee purchasers and the cause of action arose from these activities, there was sufficient connection with the state to compel the corporation to come to Tennessee to defend against such cause of action.

         When the officers of a defendant corporation may have communicated by telephone and through the mails but were never physically present in Tennessee engaging in activities from which the cause of action arose, there was insufficient contact with the state to obtain personal jurisdiction over the individual officers under this statute.

         The factors used in weighing minimum contacts are quantity, quality and nature, the source and connection of the cause of action with those contacts, interest of the forum state, and convenience, but each and every factor is not required to be present for minimum contacts to be found to exist; rather, a weighing of these factors must lead the court to conclude that the exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

         Exercise of personal jurisdiction over Montana common carrier was proper, where, by seeking and obtaining authorization to conduct business on the interstate and highways of Tennessee and by appointing an agent for the service of process in Tennessee, carrier purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Tennessee and established minimum contacts with Tennessee.

         The general formulation of the minimum contacts rule is that a nonresident defendant must have “minimum contacts” with Tennessee such that exercising jurisdiction would not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Frumkin v.

         Even a single act by defendant directed toward Tennessee that gives rise to a cause of action can support a finding of minimum contacts sufficient to exercise personal jurisdiction without offending due process.

         The acts of making phone calls and sending facsimiles into the forum, standing alone, may be sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the foreign defendant where the phone calls and faxes form the bases for the action.

         The absence of physical contacts will not defeat in personam jurisdiction where a commercial actor purposefully directs his activities toward citizens of the forum state and litigation results from injuries arising out of or relating to those activities. In such a case, the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. Masada Inv. Corp. v.

         Under the Mahasco  test the plaintiffs must show that the following elements have been satisfied as to each defendant before the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over them: First, the defendant must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state. Second, the cause of action must arise from the defendant's activities there. Finally, the acts of the defendant or consequences caused by the defendant must have a substantial enough connection with the forum state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant reasonable. Cummins v. K-Mart, Inc., 635 F. Supp. 122, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26834 (E.D. Tenn. 1986).

        <p>
         The court found sufficient minimum contacts under the three part Mahasco  test to justify in personam jurisdiction where the Virginia corporation sold a participating interest in loans to a Tennessee corporation by telephone and completed the balance of the transaction by mail without a Virginia corporation representative going to Tennessee or vice versa. First Federal Sav. Bank v. Jefferson Sav. & Loan Asso., 640 F. Supp. 47, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29431 (E.D. Tenn. 1986).

        <p>
         Under the Masada  test the three primary factors to be considered in determining whether the requisite minimum contacts are present are: (1) The quantity of the contacts; (2) their nature and quality; and (3) the source and connection of the cause of action with those contacts. Plus two lesser factors to be considered (1) the interest of the forum state; and (2) the convenience of the parties. Cummins v. K-Mart, Inc., 635 F. Supp. 122, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26834 (E.D.

         A foreign insurer qualified to do business in the state, doing business in the state, and served with process at its Tennessee office, had sufficient minimum contacts with the state to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in a case that did not arise in Tennessee, and that had no connection to the insurer's state contacts.

         Where defendant engaged in a business transaction with plaintiffs that went on over a substantial period of time, the defendant established a relationship with plaintiffs from which the defendant hoped to profit financially and then defrauded plaintiffs, altering the amount of money to be sent to them in Tennessee, the facts were sufficient to make it reasonable for Tennessee to exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant. Neal v. Janssen, 270 F.3d 328, 2001 FED App. 379P, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 22695 (6th Cir. Tenn. 2001).

         Dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was denied because defendants had made a purposeful choice to enter into a business relationship with plaintiff, a Tennessee corporation, signed multiple contracts to that end, the business relationship was mutually beneficial to plaintiff and defendants, and it was foreseeable that economic consequences would arise in Tennessee out of the business transaction.

         Chancery court erred in finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant tobacco product manufacturer because the manufacturer intentionally used a distribution system with the desired result of selling its product in all 50 states, including Tennessee, so as to support a finding that the manufacturer had minimum contacts with the State necessary to invoke the exercise of personal jurisdiction.

        <p>
         Manufacturer's awareness of the distribution system, through which it receives economic and legal benefits, justifies subjecting the manufacturer to the jurisdiction of every forum within its distributors'  market area; accordingly, a manufacturer that intentionally seeks out a distribution system, with the goal of national distribution, should reasonably expect that its products could be sold throughout the 50 states and that it could be subject to the jurisdiction of every state. This does not completely eradicate a foreign manufacturer's ability to insulate itself from personal jurisdiction in the state of Tennessee, however; if the foreign manufacturer attempts to preclude the distribution and sale of its products in the forum state, it may avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of that state. State v. NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading Co., — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 354 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 28, 2011), rehearing denied, State v. NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading Co., — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn.

         Plaintiffs failed to establish that ASCAP, a performance rights organization, operated in Tennessee as a subsidiary or local representative of defendant music publishing company because ASCAP provided only licensing services to the music publishing company, and presumably its activities in this forum were the same for all of its affiliates; in order to assert an agency relationship from which jurisdiction could be imputed, plaintiffs would have had to show that ASCAP's activities were the same as the music publishing company's would be if the publishing company had a Tennessee office — i.e., ASCAP would be performing the functions of a music publishing company in Tennessee.

         Without a showing of any additional conduct directed towards the state, mere generalized exploitation of a copyright in the stream of commerce does not amount to purposeful availment; to find otherwise would mean that a copyright infringement defendant would be subject to personal jurisdiction in any forum in which a copy of the allegedly infringing work was ultimately sold by others without the defendant taking any further acts directed at that forum.

         Tennessee trial court could not exercise general personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state hospital under the Tennessee long-arm statute because the fact that the hospital was a subsidiary of a Tennessee corporation did not establish minimum contacts with Tennessee; reliance on a declaration in an annual report that listed the hospital's principal office address as a post office box in Nashville, Tennessee was also insufficient, as was the contention that the officers and directors were in Tennessee, because these facts without more did not establish systematic and continuous contacts with Tennessee.

         It is apparent from the explicit language of subdivision (a)(7) and from reference to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02s20-2-219" target="_self">20-2-219</a></cite> which states that the long-arm statute is remedial in nature and is to be liberally construed, that the scope of the statute fully extends to the bounds imposed by the due process clause of the U.S. Const. amend. 14.

         Plaintiff mother, resident in Tennessee, who sought to modify New Mexico judgment granting child support could not use the Long Arm Statutes to obtain service on and bring defendant father within the jurisdiction of the Tennessee courts where father had had absolutely no contact with the state of Tennessee.

        <p>
         In determining the outer limits of personal jurisdiction based on a single act, the defendant must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state, the cause of action must arise from the defendant's activities there, and the acts of the defendant or consequences caused by the defendant must have a substantial enough connection with the forum to make the exercise of jurisdiction reasonable. Milan Express, Inc. v. Missie, Inc., 575 F. Supp. 931, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11902 (W.D. Tenn. 1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         In determining whether the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction, courts may also consider the quality and quantity of the defendant's contacts with the forum, the interest of the forum state, the convenience of the parties and the foreseeability that the nonresident defendant might have to defend in the forum state. Milan Express, Inc. v. Missie, Inc., 575 F. Supp. 931, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11902 (W.D. Tenn. 1983).

         Trial court erred in dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction a Tennessee civil engineering company's action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment against a Texas energy company because the energy company purposefully availed itself of conducting business in the state; the contract identified the civil engineering company as a Tennessee company, the energy company knew it was engaging a Tennessee company, and the civil engineering company did all of the work in Tennessee.

        </p>
        <p>
         Because a Tennessee civil engineering company's action stemmed directly from a Texas energy company's alleged breach of the contract, the energy company's failure to pay the contract price, its contacts with Tennessee were sufficient for specific personal jurisdiction in Tennessee; the energy company purposefully targeted Tennessee when it entered into a business transaction with a Tennessee company for a customized, specialized service to be performed in Tennessee.

        <p>
         In a breach of contract case, a Tennessee court could exercise specific personal jurisdiction over the Texas corporation because, after evaluating the Texas corporation's contacts with Tennessee related to the contract that formed the basis for the Tennessee company's suit, the circumstances exhibited intentional or purposeful acts on the part of the Texas corporation; the Texas corporation's contacts were substantial enough as it voluntarily elected to contract with the Tennessee company, and the Texas corporation knew that the contractual work would occur primarily in Tennessee; and the Texas corporation did not carry its burden of establishing that the exercise of personal jurisdiction in Tennessee would be unreasonable or unfair.

P. 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of specific personal jurisdiction an action by a Tennessee corporation alleging violation of Tennessee's Trade Secrets Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c25s47-25-1701" target="_blank">47-25-1701</a></cite>, and common law; the officers'  activities did not meet the requirements of Tennessee's long-arm statute, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02s20-2-214" target="_self">20-2-214</a></cite>, and the officers did not deliberately affiliate themselves with Tennessee notwithstanding the existence of a license agreement, which contained a Tennessee choice-of-law provision, between the North Carolina and Tennessee corporations.

         Specific personal jurisdiction over the corporation's officer was lacking because: (1) the plaintiffs had not shown that the officer purposely availed himself of the privilege of doing business in Tennessee; (2) the plaintiffs had not shown that the officer's participation in the parties'  negotiations created the quality of contacts with Tennessee required to support personal jurisdiction; (3) the plaintiffs failed to show that the terms of the contract or the future consequences of the contract in any way required the officer to perform duties or carry out activities in Tennessee; and (4) the plaintiffs had not carried their burden to show that the officer had minimum contacts with Tennessee in the course of performing the contract.

        </p>
        <p>
         Jurisdiction over the individual officers of a corporation cannot be predicated merely upon jurisdiction over the corporation; instead, the court must make an independent determination about whether it can exercise specific personal jurisdiction over an officer or agent named as a party, and the fact that the officer or agent acts in an official capacity, and not a purely personal capacity, is not dispositive of the jurisdictional issue. Therefore, the court had to separately analyze the factors to consider whether it had specific personal jurisdiction over the corporation and its officers. Noval Int'l Res., LLC v. Andec, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 2d 804, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85713 (W.D. Tenn. June 20, 2012).

         While a general posting on the Internet is not sufficient to establish minimum contacts, courts may find personal jurisdiction appropriate where there is something more to indicate that the defendant purposefully directed activities to the forum state.

         Where nonresident conspirators purposefully directed their activities toward Tennessee and should reasonably have anticipated being haled into court in Tennessee, due process concerns did not preclude the trial court from exercising personal jurisdiction over defendants.

This theory holds that an out-of-state defendant involved in a conspiracy who lacks sufficient “minimum contacts” with the forum state may nevertheless be subject to jurisdiction because of a coconspirator's contacts with the forum.

         Where a seller allegedly misrepresented the condition of a car sold over the internet, personal jurisdiction existed over the seller in the Tennessee buyer's suit because: (1) The seller knowingly interacted with a Tennessee resident; (2) The breach of contract claim arose from the seller's act of cashing the buyer's check; and (3) The misrepresentation and fraud claims stemmed from the seller's acts of calling into Tennessee and representing the car was something it was not.

         Trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over out-of-state ratings agencies regarding allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation made by a bank in Tennessee because the bank failed to demonstrate contacts between the ratings agencies and the State of Tennessee with reasonable particularity sufficient to establish a prima facie case of general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction in Tennessee, when the rating agencies rated investment products that were sold in all fifty states and purchased by the bank.

         Manufacturer's awareness of the distribution system, through which it receives economic and legal benefits, justifies subjecting the manufacturer to the jurisdiction of every forum within its distributors'  market area; accordingly, a manufacturer that intentionally seeks out a distribution system, with the goal of national distribution, should reasonably expect that its products could be sold throughout the 50 states and that it could be subject to the jurisdiction of every state. This does not completely eradicate a foreign manufacturer's ability to insulate itself from personal jurisdiction in the state of Tennessee, however; if the foreign manufacturer attempts to preclude the distribution and sale of its products in the forum state, it may avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of that state.

         Trial court erred in dismissing for lack of personal jurisdiction a Tennessee civil engineering company's action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment against a Texas energy company because the energy company purposefully availed itself of conducting business in the state; the contract identified the civil engineering company as a Tennessee company, the energy company knew it was engaging a Tennessee company, and the civil engineering company did all of the work in Tennessee.

         Because a Tennessee civil engineering company's action stemmed directly from a Texas energy company's alleged breach of the contract, the energy company's failure to pay the contract price, its contacts with Tennessee were sufficient for specific personal jurisdiction in Tennessee; the energy company purposefully targeted Tennessee when it entered into a business transaction with a Tennessee company for a customized, specialized service to be performed in Tennessee.

         1. Purpose.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The purpose of this statute was to localize transitory actions. Haynes v. Woods, 151 Tenn. 163, 268 S.W. 632, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1925), superseded by statute as stated in, Five Star Express v. Davis, 866 S.W.2d 944, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 413 (Tenn. 1993); Tims v. Carter, 192 Tenn. 386, 241 S.W.2d 501, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 417 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute was designed to prevent a proceeding whereby a plaintiff would be permitted to catch his neighbor away from home, and the home of his witnesses, and surprise him with a suit which, however able he may be to resist at home, he is wholly unable to do so among strangers. Tims v. Carter, 192 Tenn. 386, 241 S.W.2d 501, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 417 (1951).
       </p>

         2. Construction.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        This section is in derogation of the common law, and will not be given a strained construction. Carlisle v. Cowan, 85 Tenn. 165, 2 S.W. 26, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff, in an action for personal and property damages, caused by collision between an automobile and a freight train, was a resident of Houston County, where the collision occurred, and the defendant was a foreign railroad corporation which had an agent in Houston County on which service of process could be had, the venue of the action was properly in Houston County and not in Davidson County, the place of bringing the suit on the contention that the main operations of the railroad were in Davidson County. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Hooper, 52 Tenn. App. 436, 375 S.W.2d 868, 1963 Tenn. App. LEXIS 104 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1963), questioned, Bryant v. Central Motor Express, Inc., 218 Tenn. 542, 404 S.W.2d 513, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 587 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section residence of plaintiff refers to residence at the time suit is brought rather than residence at the time of occurrence of events giving rise to the action. Northcott v. Holloway, 225 Tenn. 141, 464 S.W.2d 551, 1971 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (1971).

        The language of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c04s20-4-101ol1b" target="_self">20-4-101(b)</a></cite> is mandatory and has been consistently recognized as such. Mills v. Wong, 39 S.W.3d 188, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 626 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly found that T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c04s20-4-101ol1b" target="_self">20-4-101(b)</a></cite> does not supersede the venue options afforded to homeowners in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.47.html#t47c18s47-18-109ol1a2" target="_blank">47-18-109(a)(2)</a></cite> for cases brought under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act; this special venue provision for consumer protection actions is irreconcilable with Tennessee's general venue provision and is thus presumed to be an exception to the general venue provision. Netherland v. Hunter, 133 S.W.3d 614, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 730 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 314 (Tenn. Apr. 5, 2004).

       <p>
        This statute applies to suits in chancery as well as at law, and is not made inapplicable to chancery suits by the use of the word “action” instead of the word “suit.” Childress v. Perkins, 3 Tenn. 87, 1 Cooke, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1812); Parkes v. Parkes, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 647 (1878); State ex rel. Logan v. Graper, 155 Tenn. 565, 4 S.W.2d 955, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1927).

        In transitory actions the nonresident defendant is for venue purposes, to be treated as a resident of the county of the plaintiff, and it follows that the plaintiff may bring suit against the nonresident in the county in which the plaintiff resides.

        In actions for misconduct of deputies, the common-law rule fixing venue exclusively in the situs of the defendant county applies instead of the general venue provisions of this section. O'Neal v. De Kalb County, 531 S.W.2d 296, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 550 (Tenn. 1975).

        Generally, the court in which a principal action is brought, being a proper court in which to bring that action, has jurisdiction and may determine ancillary or incidental proceedings, notwithstanding that the venue of an action as to such latter matters would be, under other circumstances, in another county.

        In a family's medical malpractice suit against a doctor, his employer, and a hospital, as the family and the employer were in the same county (the hospital was not), and the cause of action arose out of medical treatment provided in that county, transfer of venue to that county under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c04s20-4-101ol1b" target="_self">20-4-101(b)</a></cite> was proper; since the entire case could have been brought in that county initially, transfer there pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.16.html#t16c01s16-1-116" target="_blank">16-1-116</a></cite> was permissible.

        Actions against municipal corporations for personal injuries are inherently local, and must be brought in the county in which such corporations have their existence and location, and the form of process used to institute suit cannot change the nature of the action. Nashville v. Webb, 114 Tenn. 432, 85 S.W. 404, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1905), superseded by statute as stated in, Five Star Express v. Davis, 866 S.W.2d 944, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 413 (Tenn. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A true statement of the test between a local and a transitory action is whether the injury is done to a subject matter which, in its nature, could not arise beyond the locality of its situation, in contradistinction to the subject causing the injury, the typical illustration of a local action being an injury to real estate, and of a transitory action being an injury to the person. Mattix v. Swepston, 127 Tenn. 693, 155 S.W. 928, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 13 (1913); Burger v. Parker, 154 Tenn. 279, 290 S.W. 22, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 124 (1926).

        The right of suit in all transitory actions follows, but does not precede, the person of the defendant, and his temporary presence in the county, though not as a resident, gives the courts of such county jurisdiction of transitory actions against him, where process is served on him while he is present therein, but jurisdiction is not acquired where suit is brought against one not a resident of the county, who, at the time of its institution, was not actually within the county where the suit was instituted. If the suit be brought before such defendant comes within the jurisdiction of the court, and process be served upon him after he comes within such jurisdiction, the suit may be abated on plea of defendant. Childress v. Perkins, 3 Tenn. 87, 1 Cooke, 1812 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1812); Carlisle v. Cowan, 85 Tenn. 165, 2 S.W. 26, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1886); Nashville v.

        Where a nonresident defendant in a suit to recover on a promissory note was out of the state when the bill was filed, the court acquired no jurisdiction by the subsequent service on the defendant, within the county, of an alias subpoena.

        When the plaintiff and a material defendant or defendants reside in the same county, this county being the county where the cause of action accrued, the county of the residences of these parties should be the county of action for venue purposes, and under such circumstances when there are any residents of the state who live in another county and are proper defendants they may be brought into the county of residence of the plaintiff and the defendants by counterpart summons for purpose of suit.

        Because the parties resided in Campbell County and the alleged actions underlying plaintiff's claims purportedly occurred in Campbell County, the statute localized venue in Campbell County alone, and the trial court did not err in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this action; however, as the trial court did not adjudicate the case on the merits, it should not have dismissed the case with prejudice.

        An action against a city to recover damages for injury to land situated in another county, caused by the city taking, under the power of eminent domain, water which would otherwise flow through the land, can be brought only in the county where the city is located, and the rule that an action for injuries to land is local, being based on only technical reasons or private convenience, must yield to the rule that a city can be sued only in the county where it is located, since the latter rule is based upon public policy.

        The 1971 amendment to this action which permits transitory actions to be maintained in county where cause of action arose or where defendant resides or is found is remedial and can be applied retrospectively and allows a worker's compensation case to be brought in county where cause of action arose although the plant had since closed, no agent of employer remained in county and the cause of action arose before effective date of amendment.

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        A local action cannot be turned into a transitory action, or one in effect transitory, by the device of uniting another person in the action and by serving process on that person in the county in which it is desired to begin the litigation, and then by issuing a counterpart writ to another county against a defendant who could not otherwise be affected, save by an action brought in the latter county, for actions are either transitory or local, and their nature cannot be changed by the forms of process used to institute them. Nashville v. Webb, 114 Tenn. 432, 85 S.W. 404, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1905), superseded by statute as stated in, Five Star Express v. Davis, 866 S.W.2d 944, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 413 (Tenn. 1993).

         2. Mode of Pleading in Abatement.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        A plea in abatement, for want of jurisdiction of the person of the defendant because the original writ was served in one county upon a nonresident of the state and the counterpart upon the pleading defendant in another county where he resided, must be pleaded in person; but if the plea purport to be in person, it will be so taken although verified and signed by attorney. Shelby v. Johnson & Burk, 26 Tenn. 503, 1847 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1847); Bank of Tennessee v. Anderson, McDermot & Cobb, 35 Tenn. 669, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1856); Turley v. Hornsby, 71 Tenn. 264, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1879).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        In action to confirm an exchange of realty belonging to minor, failure to plead in abatement to the jurisdiction did not waive question of jurisdiction. Smartt v. Smartt, 1 Tenn. App. 68, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 12 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        When plaintiff files suit, he waives any right to dispute venue. Corby v. Matthews, 541 S.W.2d 789, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 558 (Tenn. 1976).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Where an action was brought in a county where none of the defendants resided, the return of the sheriff made on the summons that they were not to be found in his county implied that they were residents of such county, but the falsity of such return may be shown under the plea in abatement by the defendants, where an alias summons was issued upon such return and served on one of the defendants happening to be in the county, and thereupon a counterpart summons was issued to another county and served upon the other defendants. Carlisle v. Cowan, 85 Tenn. 165, 2 S.W. 26, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1886).

       <p>
        Limiting the venue of divorce suit does not affect jurisdiction of the subject matter, but confers a waivable personal privilege. Brown v. Brown, 155 Tenn. 530, 296 S.W. 356, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action for divorce brought in court having jurisdiction of that subject matter, but not in proper county, may be concluded in such court if jurisdiction as to person is waived. Brown v. Brown, 155 Tenn. 530, 296 S.W. 356, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1927).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The courts of a county have no jurisdiction of local actions brought in wrong county, and consent itself cannot give jurisdiction. Nashville v. Webb, 114 Tenn. 432, 85 S.W. 404, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1905), superseded by statute as stated in, Five Star Express v. Davis, 866 S.W.2d 944, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 413 (Tenn. 1993).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        If both parties reside in the same county, a transitory action must be brought there and tried in courts convenient to litigants and witnesses, otherwise it follows defendant and does not precede him. Haynes v. Woods, 151 Tenn. 163, 268 S.W. 632, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1925), superseded by statute as stated in, Five Star Express v. Davis, 866 S.W.2d 944, 1993 Tenn. LEXIS 413 (Tenn. 1993).

        Persons jointly liable but living in different counties may be sued in one action. Yancey v. Marriott, Frisby & Co., 33 Tenn. 28, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1853); Turley v. Hornsby, 71 Tenn. 264, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1879).

        Court has power to adjudge costs even though a plea in abatement as to venue is sustained. Brown v. Brown, 155 Tenn. 530, 296 S.W. 356, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1927).

         The change of venue is not a matter of arbitrary discretion, resting upon some uncontrollable whim, caprice, or possible bias of the judge. It is a judicial act to be performed in the mode prescribed by law. Weakley v. Pearce, 52 Tenn. 401, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 275 (1871); Sells v. King, 58 Tenn. 397, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 275 (1872).

         Ordinarily there is no particular set time that a petition for a change of venue should be filed. It should though, be filed at the first opportunity after knowledge of the facts upon which the petition is based come to those filing such petition. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co. v. Oakley, 193 Tenn. 638, 249 S.W.2d 880, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 334 (1952).

         Where gas company had obtained at least two continuances after bringing condemnation suit for easement of right-of-way, and filed petition for change of venue on same day that jury was summoned for trial, it was within discretion of trial judge to deny petition in view of fact that grounds therefor were known to petitioners many weeks before date of filing. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co. v. Oakley, 193 Tenn. 638, 249 S.W.2d 880, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 334 (1952).

         Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiff's motion to change venue in a civil rights action against the county, its officials, and its deputies because as to pre-trial publicity there was no evidence in the record other than the bare and conclusory few statements in plaintiff's affidavit, there was no other testimony by any other witness nor proof regarding threats, demonstrations, or other hostility towards a party, the trial court was careful and thorough in its attempts to insure that no member of the venire or jury was unduly biased by pre-trial knowledge or conceptions about the case, and 12 years elapsed between the incident and the trial.

         The correct practice is to hear the witnesses for and against the change of venue, in open court, or to cause their depositions to be taken as in other cases, and affidavits in opposition to a change of venue may be received under very special circumstances. Weakley v. Pearce, 52 Tenn. 401, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 275 (1871); Conley v. Mason, 2 Shan. 626 (1874).

         The better practice in all such cases would be to set out all the evidence in a formal bill of exceptions, so that the action of the circuit court may, in a proper case, be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

         It is error to refuse to hear evidence that one of the compurgators was interested in the cause, and, therefore, not such witness as the statute requires. The compurgators may be shown to be interested by counter affidavits, by their examination upon oath in open court, or by the examination of other witnesses. It is not the meaning of the statute that the compurgators may swear to their own respectability and disinterestedness, and that no evidence shall be heard on the other side. Weakley v.

         There can be no valid objection to the affidavit of an agent or attorney in support of the application, where it is supported by the affidavits of the three respectable and disinterested persons.

         A change of venue is properly made where the only objection to the validity thereof is based upon the ground that the compurgators, by whose oath the application is verified and supported, are agents and employees of the party applying for the change, where they are shown to be respectable, and there is nothing to show that they are interested in the result of the cause. Conk v. N. & C.R.R., 1 Shannon's Cases 409 (1875).

         The change of venue is not a matter of arbitrary discretion resting upon some uncontrollable whim, caprice or possible bias of the judge but is a judicial act to be performed in the mode presented by law and in no other mode. Weakley v. Pearce, 52 Tenn. 401, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 275 (1871).

         Where gas company has obtained at least two continuances after bringing condemnation suit for easement of right-of-way, and filed petition for change of venue on same day that jury was summoned for trial, it was within discretion of trial judge to deny petition in view of fact that grounds therefor were known to petitioners many weeks before date of filing.

         In the change of venue, the provisions of the order of the court must be strictly followed, in order to confer jurisdiction upon the intended court; and where the order of the change of venue directed the transcript of the record to be sent to the court to which the cause was removed, at least 15 days before the sitting of the next term of that court, such order must be complied with, to confer jurisdiction upon that court.

         Where the order changing the venue was void, and the judgment is reversed for that reason, the Supreme Court may remand the case to the court of the original venue, with directions to the court to which the venue was attempted to be changed to transmit or return all the original papers and orders made in the cause to the court of the original venue.

         The record should show that the statute in regard to the change of venue has been strictly complied with. It should show not only by whom the change of venue is asked for, and that the application is supported by at least three respectable and disinterested persons, but that, in the opinion of the court, the cause for the change is good, and the truth of the allegation made is evident, and that the change of venue is ordered because it appears to the court that the party applying for the change cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the county where the cause is then pending.

         The fair interpretation of this statute is, that the venue should only be changed to a county out of the circuit, where such county is the nearest free from like exceptions. If the nearest county should be in the circuit, but should not be free from like exceptions, then the venue might be changed to a county out of the circuit, not subject to like exceptions. If none of the adjoining counties are shown to be subject to like exceptions, then it is the imperative duty of the judge to send the cause to the nearest county. Coover v. Davenport, 48 Tenn. 368, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 71, 2 Am. Rep. 706 (1870).
        </p>
        <p>
         The nearest county is the one whose county seat or courthouse is nearest to the county from which the venue is proposed to be changed; and the circuit judge should take judicial notice of what county is thus the nearest. Coover v. Davenport, 48 Tenn. 368, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 71, 2 Am. Rep. 706 (1870).
        </p>
        <p>
         Upon a change of venue, the law requires that the cause shall be transferred to the nearest adjoining county. The transfer is, of course, to a court of the same character and jurisdiction as the court in which the suit is pending. If there be two courts in the nearest county answering the description, it must necessarily be left to the judge to direct to which court the transfer shall be made; and his action cannot be revised by the supreme court, in the absence of anything showing an abuse of his discretion. Greer v. Whitfield, 72 Tenn. 85, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1879).

       Two terms after death of a party an action can be abated, but if procedure is not followed the action can be revived by a bill of revivor. Cobb v. Conway, 1 Tenn. 294, 1808 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1808).
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit which has abated by the death of either party, may be revived by or against the heirs, personal representatives or assigns who may be legally entitled to decedent's place in the subject matter of the litigation. Burnett v. Layman, 130 Tenn. 423, 171 S.W. 76, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       In suit by conservator to have certain deeds of a decedent declared invalid, where plaintiff died prior to submission of case to jury it was error for the trial court to proceed with the submission of the case to the jury without revivor in the name of the proper party complainants and in withholding from the jury the information of the plaintiff's death, however such error was not reversible where no assignment of error was made to this action of the court. Holmes v. Dorris, 55 Tenn. App. 279, 399 S.W.2d 512, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in action brought by conservator, court erred in submitting case to jury after receiving word that complainant had died, the action of the chancellor in reviving the cause in the name of the proper parties complainant after the verdict of the jury was received but before a decree was entered cured all defects resulting from the failure of the chancellor to require the cause to be revived before the submission of the case to the jury. Holmes v. Dorris, 55 Tenn. App. 279, 399 S.W.2d 512, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).

      <p>
       Where, in action by conservator of plaintiff to have deeds executed by a deceased declared invalid, the plaintiff died prior to the submission of the case to the jury, defendant was not entitled to a mistrial, but only to have the proceedings suspended until the cause was revived in the name of the proper parties. Holmes v. Dorris, 55 Tenn. App. 279, 399 S.W.2d 512, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).

       Suits commenced, with a single exception (that of actions for wrongs affecting the plaintiff's character), shall not abate or discontinue upon the death of either party, but may be revived. Churchwell v. Bank of East Tennessee, 48 Tenn. 780, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 147 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       The tendency has been, by decision and by statute, to limit and circumscribe the effect of the rule that actions abate by the death of the parties thereto; and there is no case to be found within the last two centuries in which the scope of this rule has been extended or broadened. Harris v. Nashville Trust Co., 128 Tenn. 573, 162 S.W. 584, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 72, 49 L.R.A. (n.s.) 897 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether there is survival depends upon the substance, not form, of the action. Bowman v. Hart, 161 Tenn. 402, 33 S.W.2d 58, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       In suit by conservator to have certain deeds of a decedent declared invalid, where plaintiff died prior to submission of case to jury it was error for the trial court to proceed with the submission of the case to the jury without revivor in the name of the proper party complainants and in withholding from the jury the information of the plaintiff's death, however such error was not reversible where no assignment of error was made to this action of the court. Holmes v. Dorris, 55 Tenn. App. 279, 399 S.W.2d 512, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in action brought by conservator, court erred in submitting case to jury after receiving word that complainant had died, the action of the chancellor in reviving the cause in the name of the proper parties complainant after the verdict of the jury was received but before a decree was entered cured all defects resulting from the failure of the chancellor to require the cause to be revived before the submission of the case to the jury. Holmes v. Dorris, 55 Tenn. App. 279, 399 S.W.2d 512, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 168 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
      </p>

       Trial court erred in not allowing both of the estate representatives' claims for personal injuries and wrongful death to go to the jury, with the understanding that the representatives were not to have double recovery for the same damages, and to rule otherwise would have given no force and effect to the plain language of Tenn.

       When a trial court held that the decedent's claims passed automatically on the decedent's death from unrelated causes after the commencement of a medical malpractice action to the surviving spouse without need to substitute parties, remand was necessary because the court erroneously ruled—as the co-executors of the estate were the appropriate parties to revive the action—and was to determine whether the response to the health care providers'  motion to dismiss was to be construed as a motion for enlargement of time to substitute parties.

       Where the plaintiff recovers a judgment against the defendant in an action for “wrongs affecting the character of the plaintiff,” from which judgment the defendant appeals, in the nature of a writ of error, and, pending the appeal, either dies, a revivor of the appeal may be had in favor of or against the personal representative of the deceased party, as the case may be. This is allowed on the principle that the recovery of a judgment merges the tort, which was the foundation of the action, into the judgment, and it thus becomes a debt, and that the appeal in the nature of a writ of error merely suspends, and does not vacate or annul, the judgment.

       The defendant's death, pending his appeal from a judgment against him in an action for breach of promise to marry, operates to abate the action where the judgment is subsequently reversed, and the cause remanded.

       The enactment of this section in no way created any new and independent cause of action; it merely preserved the cause of action that belonged to the person before the one who caused the injury died. Goins v. Coulter, 185 Tenn. 346, 206 S.W.2d 379, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 338 (1947).

       Right of action for damages for seduction and breach of promise of marriage against the heirs and administrator of the alleged seducer who died a few months before the action was begun is saved by this section notwithstanding the provisions of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-102" target="_self">20-5-102</a></cite> providing for abatement of actions already commenced, which affect the character of the plaintiff, upon the death of either party.

       In a personal injury action filed by plaintiff injured party against a deceased driver, a trial court properly denied plaintiff's Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03 motion to amend to add the personal representative as a defendant and dismissed the action because plaintiff failed to name the personal representative as a defendant before the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations, as required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-103" target="_self">20-5-103</a></cite>. Vaughn v. Morton, 371 S.W.3d 116, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 201 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 435 (Tenn. June 19, 2012).

      <p>
       Trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's personal injury lawsuit and denied plaintiff's relief based on excusable neglect; plaintiff filed suit against the former personal representative of defendant, after the estate was opened, administered, and closed. The trial court found that the original lawsuit, while timely filed, was a nullity because the estate had been closed. The failure to strictly follow the statute by naming the personal representative was fatal to the survivability of the action. Algee v. Craig, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 137 (Tenn. Ct.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying victims'  petition to intervene in an estate's wrongful death action against a city because filing of an intervening complaint was not a substitute for a properly filed tort action directly against the estate under the Survival Statute; because the victims did not follow the statute's procedure, they had no claim against the decedent's estate for the damages he allegedly caused prior to his death.

       Trial court did not err in granting an uninsured motorist carrier summary judgment because an insured's claim against it was barred; because a driver, the alleged tortfeasor, died prior to the filing of the complaint, in order to comply with the Survival Statute, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-103ol1a" target="_self">20-5-103(a)</a></cite>, the insured was required to serve the driver's personal representative with process prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-104ol1a1" target="_blank">28-3-104(a)(1)</a></cite>, but the insured failed to submit any evidence showing that an estate was ever established for the grinder.

Golde, 80 Tenn. 267, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (1883); McDonald v. Nashville, 114 Tenn. 540, 86 S.W. 317, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1904).

      <p>
       A revivor against an heir, even a minor, is not subject to be declared void in a collateral attack, because it fails to show that no one would administer. At most, this is only an error that might be corrected upon a direct review. Edgington v. Jamison, 70 Tenn. 569, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 198 (1879); Preston v. Golde, 80 Tenn. 267, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the suit is by the vendee for the rescission of a contract for the sale and purchase of land, and for the recovery of the purchase money paid and the heirs answer without objection for want of revivor against the personal representative of the deceased defendant vendor, the heirs do not thereby waive the want of suggestion that no one could be procured to administer. Preston v. Golde, 80 Tenn. 267, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       The suggestion and assumption of record that no one could be procured to administer, as prerequisite to the issuance of a scire facias to revive against the heirs in order to obtain a judgment against them on account of lands descended or personalty received from their ancestor, cannot be waived by a minor heir, nor by his guardian ad litem. Preston v. Golde, 80 Tenn. 267, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit for damages for personal injuries, brought by the injured party, cannot be revived in the name of his heirs at law or next of kin, unless it is shown that no person will administer on the estate of deceased plaintiff.

       The nonresident heirs of the deceased appellate in an action of replevin, who was the defendant below, and who died pending the appeal in the supreme court, may revive the suit in their names if no person will administer on the estate in this state, although an administration was granted in the state of the appellant's domicile.

       Ordering a scire facias, at the same time the suit is revived in favor of the heirs of the deceased plaintiff, will not vitiate the order of revivor. Boyd v. Titzer, 46 Tenn. 568, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (1869).
      </p>
      <p>
       A revivor may be made against nonresidents by bill of revivor stating the matters required to be stated in the scire facies, when that remedy is used, and by publication.

       Where persons claiming to be the proper representatives of deceased parties present themselves and move to revive, in favor of themselves, a pending cause, even in the supreme court, the opposing litigant may resist the revivor upon any sufficient ground, such as that they are not the heirs or all the heirs; and so, where it is sought to revive a pending suit against the heirs of a deceased party, such heirs may resist the revivor upon any sufficient ground, and the court must, in acting on the motion to revive, pass upon and decide these questions. Upon issue joined on the plea as to heirship, the proof may be made in open court, or by depositions taken upon notice, or before the clerk upon a reference to him for the purpose; and the latter, being the most convenient mode, has been adopted in practice. Mayfield v. Stephenson, 65 Tenn. 397, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 372 (1873); Berrigan v. Fleming, 70 Tenn. 271, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1879); Campbell v. Hubbard, 79 Tenn. 6, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1883); Allen v.

      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a good plea to the motion to revive a suit in the name of the heirs of a deceased plaintiff (all nonresidents) that the deceased had made a will in the state of his domicile, which had been probated under the laws of that state. Campbell v. Hubbard, 79 Tenn. 6, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1883).

       After the revivor, the judgment cannot be rendered for or against the heirs personally, but must be in their representative character. The execution on the judgment will issue against them, to be levied of the goods and chattels of the deceased in their possession, subject to execution. If there be no such goods and chattels, then to be levied on the lands and tenements of the deceased descended to the heirs. Brown v. L. Rocco & Co., 56 Tenn. 187, 1872 Tenn.

       Where the order awarding the issuance of the writ of scire facias against the administrator and heirs of a deceased defendant names all of them, except one heir, and the writ issued was actually served upon the administrator and all the heirs, naming them, the revivor was held to be valid, although the true given name of the heir whose name was entirely omitted in the court's minute order was not stated in the return, but another given name was stated.

       If a party die pending the suit in the appellate court, and no one will administer on his estate, it may be revived by scire facias against his heirs and judgment entered for or against them in their representative capacity. Brown v. L. Rocco & Co., 56 Tenn. 187, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 124 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a chancery case, an appeal, when perfected, vacates the decree of the chancery court, and if a party dies pending the appeal, the suit, not the decree, may be revived in the appellate court. Ransom v. Carlisle, 8 Tenn. App. 448, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 160 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       When a trial court held that the decedent's claims passed automatically on the decedent's death from unrelated causes after the commencement of a medical malpractice action to the surviving spouse without need to substitute parties, remand was necessary because the court erroneously ruled—as the co-executors of the estate were the appropriate parties to revive the action—and was to determine whether the response to the health care providers'  motion to dismiss was to be construed as a motion for enlargement of time to substitute parties.

      <p>
       All of the wrongful death statutes must be construed with reference to one another. Foster v. Jeffers, 813 S.W.2d 449, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Mar. 18, 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (Tenn. May 6, 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of recovery in a wrongful death case is strictly a creation of statute. Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in not allowing both of the estate representatives' claims for personal injuries and wrongful death to go to the jury, with the understanding that the representatives were not to have double recovery for the same damages, and to rule otherwise would have given no force and effect to the plain language of Tenn. Civ. Proc. Rule 8 and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-102" target="_self">20-5-102</a></cite>; under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-113" target="_self">20-5-113</a></cite>, the representatives were not able to recover pain and suffering damages under their wrongful death claim under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-106" target="_self">20-5-106</a></cite> and also under their personal injury claim, but this did not require that the personal injury claim be dismissed because the jury could have found that the nursing home injured the decedent but did not ultimately cause the decedent's death. Rolen v. Wood Presbyterian Home, Inc., 174 S.W.3d 158, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 278 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 974 (Tenn. Oct. 24, 2005).

       This statute is largely a counterpart of the first and second sections of what is familiarly known as Lord Campbell's Act, passed by the British Parliament in the year 1846 (Stat. 9 and 10 Vic., ch. 93, §§ 1, 2), and is very similar to statutes subsequently enacted by many of the American states.

       This statute does not copy the English act, but gives larger damages in that it gives damages for the injuries suffered by the deceased, in addition to the pecuniary loss of the persons entitled to the recovery, which latter alone is recoverable under the English act.

       In a wrongful death action by the father who survived the deceased mother, and the mother's unborn child, it was clear that a viable fetus “resided wherever its mother resided,” and therefore, the family exclusion provision in the policy was applicable, the insurer was not required to provide coverage for bodily injury to fetus, and the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of father, was reversed.

      <p>
       The right of action of the deceased for personal injuries wrongfully inflicted causing his death is kept alive and preserved by statute, for the benefit of his widow, children or next of kin, and a suit commenced by decedent while in life may be prosecuted to judgment for the same purpose; but no new or independent cause of action is created in favor of such parties.

       Where death resulted other than from the acts of the defendant, and where no action was instituted before death, a cause of action for pain and suffering did not survive the death of the victim. Stewart v. Crook Sanatorium, 17 Tenn. App. 589, 69 S.W.2d 259, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

       Amended declaration in death action based on law of foreign state did not change cause of action merely because amended complaint cited particular foreign statutes upon which plaintiff relied to sustain cause of action which original declaration did not cite.

       This section creates no new cause of action, but merely preserves from abatement or extinguishment the right of action which a person dying from the wrongful act of another would have had against the wrongdoer, had death not ensued. Wilson v. Massengill, 124 F.2d 666, 1942 U.S. App. LEXIS 4550 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1942), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">316 U.S. 686</cite>, <cite class="s_court">62 S.

       Where death resulted from brain tumor and testimony of family physician that tumor may have been aggravated by electric shock received on defendant's car was purely speculative and testimony by experts in the field of neurosurgery testified that the cause of the particular tumor was unknown, it was proper for the court to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant on the ground that death of deceased was not caused by the electric shock. Gipson v. Memphis S. R. Co., 51 Tenn. App. 31, 364 S.W.2d 110, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).

      <p>
       In wrongful death action complaint which alleged that deceased, the alleged paramour of defendant, had been under domination and control of defendant and that he had sadistically treated her to the extent that she committed suicide was not sufficient to state a cause of action since complaint alleged an efficient, intervening and unforeseen cause.

       The language of the Tennessee Wrongful Death Statute is sufficiently broad to embrace an action where death has resulted from breach of an implied statutory warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code.

       Surviving spouse never had an individual claim to assert because the wrongful death claims he asserted against a hospital were brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the decedent; the decedent's children did not have a separate claim but one indivisible cause of action existed, the cause of action the decedent would have had against the wrongdoer, and thus, the decedent's survivors were only permitted to assert the cause of action in a representative capacity on the decedent's behalf.

       In an action by an administrator under this section, where the summons was silent as to beneficiaries, and the declaration stated that the action was for the benefit of the brothers of deceased, and a plea in abatement questioned the right of the brothers to be beneficiaries, and plaintiff asked leave to amend the declaration by striking out the words concerning beneficiaries and by stating that the action was for the benefit of the parents of deceased, and this application for leave to amend was made after the expiration of the statute of limitations, and the court refused to permit the amendment and dismissed the action, it was held that the issuance of the summons was the commencement of the action and the proposed amendment was not inconsistent with the summons and would not have been the commencement of a new cause of action after the expiration of the statute of limitations, and that the court erred in refusing to permit the amendment and in dismissing the action.

       In action by father as next of kin for wrongful death of minor son father could amend complaint so as to include mother of deceased as party plaintiff and amendment would relate back to time of filing original action, since cause of action would not be changed by adding party plaintiff; and this was so even though suit by mother would have been barred by statute of limitations.

       In a wrongful death action, where married deceased's parents had brought the action but the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the right of action, if any, passed to deceased's husband rather than to her parents, it was proper to allow substitution of deceased's husband as plaintiff in the action under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 17.01, even though the statute of limitations of one year had run prior to the filing of the motion for substitution, since the husband was the real party in interest and he made his application for substitution within a reasonable time after objection was made by defendants to the status of the original plaintiffs as real parties in interest.

Lowe v. Collins, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 608 (1912).

       Where persons perish in the same disaster, there is no presumption of survivorship resting upon considerations of age, sex, strength, corpulency, or activity, and, in the absence of evidence from which survivorship can be determined, it will be presumed, for the purpose of settling rights and succession to property, and for determining who are entitled to the damages for the wrongful deaths of such persons, that all persons perishing in such disaster died at the same moment. Walton & Co. v. Burchel, 121 Tenn. 715, 121 S.W. 391, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 34, 130 Am. St. Rep. 788 (1907).

       Where a minor son perished at the same time with his father in a common disaster caused by the defendant's negligence, and left no widow and children, but left his mother, brothers, and sisters surviving him as his next of kin, the right of action for his wrongful death survived and passed to his personal representative for them. Walton & Co. v. Burchel, 121 Tenn. 715, 121 S.W. 391, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 34, 130 Am. St. Rep. 788 (1907).

       Recovery in favor of widow for wrongful death of her husband is not affected or defeated by her divorce bill, for the suit, though in the name of the administrator, is the action of the husband brought by his administrator to recover the pecuniary value of his life, although the widow is the beneficiary of the suit, her husband having no children.

       A parent has no right to sue individually for damages for injuries sustained by his minor daughter who has been wrongfully killed, though he is the sole beneficiary. But in suit erroneously begun by him, the summons is effective to bring defendant before the court; and, though administrator is not substituted until over a year after the injuries, the action is not barred. Whitson v. Tennessee C. R. Co., 163 Tenn. 35, 40 S.W.2d 396, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 136 (1931) (decided prior to 1932 Code).

       Recovery by father as administrator and beneficiary for wrongful death of his minor son bars subsequent action for loss of services and for expenses in a suit brought by him individually for loss of services, loss of time and expenses between the date of the injury and the death of the son, for it was incumbent upon him to bring forward, in his first suit, all the damages recoverable in such cases, because he was the sole beneficiary thereof. Tennessee Coal, Iron & R.R. v. Watts, 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 347 (1909); Chess-Wymond Co. v. Davis, 4 Tenn. Civ. App. (4 Higgins) 197 (1913).

       The next of kin for whose benefit the right of action survives are the real plaintiffs, and the administrator, though made a party plaintiff by the statute, is nevertheless a mere trustee and a nominal party.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the cause of action for decedent's death arose in Mississippi, the fact that suit was brought in Tennessee by decedent's mother, instead of by his administrator, was immaterial, since under the Tennessee law, an administrator's relation to the beneficiaries is that of trustee only. Strait v. Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co., 209 F. 157, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1765, 49 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1068 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1913).

      <p>
       The attempted compromise settlement for the wrongful death of minor child by the administrator of child's estate was inoperative against the child's legal father who resided outside the state, and the trial court properly permitted the father to intervene in the suit within 30 days from the entering of the consent decree and properly granted a new trial. Cummins v. Woody, 177 Tenn. 636, 152 S.W.2d 246, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1941).
      </p>

       An action by a father and son to recover for the death of their wife and mother was not barred by a compromise settlement made by the administrator of the wife's estate where it was shown that neither the father nor son received any part of the compromise settlement.

       An automobile insurer properly paid the limits of its liability under its policy's uninsured motorist coverage to the spouse of the insured who was killed in an automobile accident, without notifying any other potential beneficiary that settlement with the spouse had been effected.

       The recovery for the wrongful death of deceased should not be appropriated to the payment of his debts as it is not an asset of his estate. Cunningham v. Hutcherson, 14 Tenn. App. 173, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 25 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).

       Where joint tort-feasors are responsible for a wrongful death, the sum received by administrator from one under a covenant not to sue is not a satisfaction and does not reduce the amount recoverable against the other.

      </p>
      <p>
       The recovery is to be determined by a consideration of the life expectancy of the decedent, his age, condition of health, capacity for labor, and for earning money through skill in any art, trade, profession, occupation or business, and his personal habits as to sobriety and industry. Memphis S. R. Co. v. Cooper, 203 Tenn. 425, 313 S.W.2d 444, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 321 (1958).

       Proceeds of an action for wrongful death are personalty and the court will look to statutes on distribution of personalty as a guide. Dilworth v. Tisdale Transfer & Storage Co., 209 Tenn. 449, 354 S.W.2d 261, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 376 (1962).

       The administrator of a decedent's estate is the real party in interest, as state statute authorizes him to prosecute an action for wrongful death in his own name and must be considered as such for determination of diversity of citizenship.

       There was material evidence that the injuries the decedent suffered did not ultimately cause the decedent's death, and thus the court affirmed the judgment for the nursing home on estate representatives' wrongful death claim under T.C.A. 20-5-106.

       Government was properly granted summary judgment in the plaintiff’s wrongful death action brought under Tennessee law, as authorized by the Federal Tort Claims Act, arising out of the shooting death of her husband because an objectively reasonable officer armed with the agent’s knowledge and in the agent's position would have had probable cause to believe that the decedent, who was in an enclosed space holding a gun and refusing to submit to the officers’ show of force but, instead, began withdrawing the gun from its holster, posed the threat of serious physical harm to officers, and because the agent’s actions were reasonable, the agent was not negligent under Tennessee law.

       When a trial court held that the decedent's claims passed automatically on the decedent's death from unrelated causes after the commencement of a medical malpractice action to the surviving spouse without need to substitute parties, remand was necessary because the court erroneously ruled—as the co-executors of the estate were the appropriate parties to revive the action—and was to determine whether the response to the health care providers'  motion to dismiss was to be construed as a motion for enlargement of time to substitute parties.

       All of the wrongful death statutes must be construed with reference to one another. Foster v. Jeffers, 813 S.W.2d 449, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Mar. 18, 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (Tenn. May 6, 1991).

       <span class="boldspan">
        2. Widow's Right of Action.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The widow's right of action is superior to that of the administrator, and he cannot sue until the widow waives her right of action. Koontz v. Fleming, 17 Tenn. App. 1, 65 S.W.2d 821, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite surviving spouse's priority to assert a wrongful death action, the surviving spouse and the decedent's children stand on equal footing with respect to each other; therefore, the common fund doctrine is applicable and entitles a trial court to award the surviving spouse's attorney, but not the children's attorney, contingency fees from the settlement proceeds. Kline ex rel. Kline v. Eyrich, 69 S.W.3d 197, 2002 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (Tenn. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the statute allows the surviving spouse or next of kin to “institute” the wrongful death action on behalf of the decedent, the statute does not authorize the individual to practice law while doing so. Beard v. Branson, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 233 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2016), rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 287 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2016), rev'd, 528 S.W.3d 487, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 540 (Tenn. Aug. 30, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a surviving spouse's pro se wrongful death complaint asserted claims on behalf of another individual and was not signed by a licensed attorney, the filing of that complaint was a nullity; the surviving spouse was not a licensed attorney and could not file a valid complaint that asserted claims on behalf of another individual without it being signed by a licensed attorney, and since the complaint was a nullity and had no legal effect, it did not operate to toll the statute of limitations. Beard v. Branson, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 233 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2016), rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 287 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2016), rev'd, 528 S.W.3d 487, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 540 (Tenn. Aug. 30, 2017).

       The widow is not entitled to the whole fund received by her as administratrix, but it goes to her and the children in equal parts. Throgmorton v. Oliver, 144 Tenn. 282, 230 S.W. 967, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Widow, recovering, is a trustee, and the trust is enforceable in action at law upon implied contract, which action is subject to the statute of limitations. Powell v. Blake, 161 Tenn. 516, 33 S.W.2d 78, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1930).

       Failure to bring suit until seven months after the decedent's death when § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_blank">28-3-104</a></cite> allowed 12 months was not such delay as to constitute a waiver of her right of action by the widow. Koontz v. Fleming, 17 Tenn. App. 1, 65 S.W.2d 821, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       The alleged tort-feasor in a wrongful death action by the administrator is competent to raise the question of the widow's superior right of action. Koontz v. Fleming, 17 Tenn. App. 1, 65 S.W.2d 821, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       The widow may waive her right of action by allowing the administrator's suit to stand without objection. Koontz v. Fleming, 17 Tenn. App. 1, 65 S.W.2d 821, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 44 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

       Fact that administratrix was not widow of decedent as alleged was immaterial since recovery is held for real beneficiaries. Memphis S. R. Co. v. Cooper, 203 Tenn. 425, 313 S.W.2d 444, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 321 (1958).

      <p>
       Administrator's motion to intervene pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Martin v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 231 F.R.D. 532, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29566 (W.D. Tenn. 2005).

       The father of a decedent leaving no widow or children, as administrator of his estate, is entitled to recover the damages for the wrongful death of his intestate, caused by the defendant's negligence, although there may be beneficiaries other than the father, for the administrator recovers as trustee for the real beneficiaries under the statute, and must account to them, whoever they may be, for the proceeds of the judgment. Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Brown, 125 Tenn. 351, 143 S.W. 1129, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1911).

       The mother and sister of a 13 year old decedent are the beneficiaries of a judgment recovered, by his administrator, for his death. Anderson v. Memphis S. R. Co., 143 Tenn. 216, 227 S.W. 39, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrator, recovering for wrongful death, is not the express trustee for a child. Jackson v. Dobbs, 154 Tenn. 602, 290 S.W. 402, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 158 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attempted compromise settlement for the wrongful death of minor child by the administrator of child's estate was inoperative against the child's legal father who resided outside the state, and the trial court properly permitted the father to intervene in the suit within 30 days from the entering of the consent decree and properly granted a new trial. Cummins v. Woody, 177 Tenn. 636, 152 S.W.2d 246, 1940 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The one who sues as administrator and recovers damages for the wrongful death of the decedent holds the recovery as trustee for the real beneficiaries under the statute and must account to them, whoever they may be, for the proceeds of the judgment. Memphis S. R. Co. v. Cooper, 203 Tenn. 425, 313 S.W.2d 444, 1958 Tenn. LEXIS 321 (1958).

       Surviving spouse never had an individual claim to assert because the wrongful death claims he asserted against a hospital were brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the decedent; the decedent's children did not have a separate claim but one indivisible cause of action existed, the cause of action the decedent would have had against the wrongdoer, and thus, the decedent's survivors were only permitted to assert the cause of action in a representative capacity on the decedent's behalf.

       All of the wrongful death statutes must be construed with reference to one another. Foster v. Jeffers, 813 S.W.2d 449, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Mar. 18, 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (Tenn. May 6, 1991).

       An action for personal injuries commenced by the injured party does not abate by his death resulting from such injuries, but may be prosecuted to final judgment, in his name, without revivor, for the use of the widow and children or next of kin. Chambers v. Porter, 45 Tenn. 273, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1868); Fowlkes v. Nashville & D. R. Co., 56 Tenn. 829, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1872); Webb v.

      <p>
       Where injured person's suit proceeds without revivor after death, to justify a recovery, it must be shown that plaintiff died of the injury for which his suit was brought, and that he left a widow or next of kin. Daniel v. East Tennessee Coal Co., 105 Tenn. 470, 58 S.W. 859, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1900); Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999); Memphis St. Ry. v. Prince, 2 Tenn. Civ. App. (2 Higgins) 688 (1912).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff dies from cause other than the injury sued for, and without widow or next of kin, the action cannot be prosecuted without revivor, and it seems that such action may be revived in the name of the personal representative, and prosecuted for the benefit of the plaintiff's estate, after his death. Daniel v. East Tennessee Coal Co., 105 Tenn. 470, 58 S.W. 859, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1900); McDonald v. Nashville, 114 Tenn. 540, 86 S.W. 317, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1904); Memphis St. Ry. v. Prince, 2 Tenn. Civ. App. (2 Higgins) 688 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       Revivor of deceased plaintiff's suit is not authorized where either of the elements of death from wrongful act or existence of designated beneficiary are wanting. Stewart v. Crook Sanatorium, 17 Tenn. App. 589, 69 S.W.2d 259, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The suit for personal injuries cannot be revived in the name of the heirs at law or next of kin of the deceased plaintiff, unless it is shown that no one will administer on the estate of the deceased. McDonald v. Nashville, 114 Tenn. 540, 86 S.W. 317, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the injured party brought suit for personal injuries, and thereafter died from other supervening causes, the suit may be revived by the personal representative, during the trial and after a motion to dismiss the suit. Memphis St. Ry. v. Prince, 2 Tenn. Civ. App. (2 Higgins) 688 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       An action for malpractice does not abate upon the plaintiff's death resulting from a cause other than such malpractice of the defendant; and the action may be revived in the name of the plaintiff's personal representative, but not in the name of his widow or next of kin. Burnett v. Layman, 130 Tenn. 423, 171 S.W. 76, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1914); Burnett v. Layman, 133 Tenn. 323, 181 S.W. 157, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1915).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where no suit was brought in decedent's lifetime, an action to recover damages for the use of the widow and minor children of decedent must be predicated upon the injuries sustained, which caused the death, and cannot be based upon physical pain and suffering of decedent caused by a trip to a hospital for the insane, in an ambulance, on being refused treatment at defendant's hospital. Stewart v. Crook Sanatorium, 17 Tenn. App. 589, 69 S.W.2d 259, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       If deceased received injuries at the hands of a wrongdoer, but which injuries did not produce death, and for which suit was not brought while living, the action could not survive in favor of the personal representative or of the widow and minor children. Stewart v. Crook Sanatorium, 17 Tenn. App. 589, 69 S.W.2d 259, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

       Where the injured person in his lifetime compromised and settled his right of action, nothing will, upon his death, pass to his personal representative or beneficiaries under the statute, though his death results from such injuries. Trafford v. Adams Express Co., 76 Tenn. 96, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1881); Brown v. Chattanooga E. R. Co., 101 Tenn. 252, 47 S.W. 415, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 58, 70 Am. St. Rep. 666 (1898).

       Where the injured person in his lifetime assigned the expected recovery for his personal injuries, the recovery obtained will inure to the benefit of the assignee, and nothing will pass upon his death to his personal representative or the beneficiaries under the statute. Trafford v. Adams Express Co., 76 Tenn. 96, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1881) (dictum).

       From a judgment abating an action for personal injuries on account of the plaintiff's death, and appeal or writ of error will lie, without revivor, in the name of the deceased plaintiff, upon a bond bearing his name, executed after his death. Daniel v. East Tennessee Coal Co., 105 Tenn. 470, 58 S.W. 859, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit brought by the injured party may be abated at the third or any subsequent term of the court after the suggestion and proof or admission of the death of the plaintiff, where it is not affirmatively shown that the plaintiff died of the injuries for which he sued. McDonald v. Nashville, 114 Tenn. 540, 86 S.W. 317, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1904).

      <p>
       The suit of a husband for personal injuries wrongfully inflicted, upon his death, becomes the suit of his widow to all intents and purposes, without revivor; and upon dismissal of such suit, upon a ground not concluding the right of action, a new suit may be commenced by her within one year thereafter. Stuber v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 113 Tenn. 305, 87 S.W. 411, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1904).

      <p>
       In an action for personal injuries prosecuted after the plaintiff's death resulting from such injuries, a form of verdict and judgment thereon, naming the widow and children as the beneficiaries, and pronouncing judgment in their favor in the name of the deceased plaintiff, is stated as made in the lower court, and seems to be approved by the Supreme Court. Chambers v. Porter, 45 Tenn. 273, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1868).

       The expenses incurred by a widow in supporting her children cannot be charged against their interest in the recovery obtained by the widow for the wrongful death of her husband. Throgmorton v. Oliver, 144 Tenn. 282, 230 S.W. 967, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Damages recovered for a husband's death are not assets of his estate, proper; nor are same subject to widow's yearly allowance, nor for funeral expenses. Throgmorton v. Oliver, 144 Tenn. 282, 230 S.W. 967, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1921); Powell v. Blake, 161 Tenn. 516, 33 S.W.2d 78, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1930); Cunningham v. Hutcherson, 14 Tenn.

       The fund recoverable for a wrongful death does not occupy the same status as the proceeds of a life insurance policy payable to the assured, which he may dispose of while he lives; but it passes by operation of the statutes, and according to their provisions. Haynes v. Walker, 111 Tenn. 106, 76 S.W. 902, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The recovery for a wrongful death cannot pass under the will of the deceased. Haynes v. Walker, 111 Tenn. 106, 76 S.W. 902, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the recovery of damages goes to the children of the decedent, the children of a deceased child of the decedent will take the share that their parent would have taken if alive. Haynes v. Walker, 111 Tenn. 106, 76 S.W. 902, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any recovery passes immediately to the statutory beneficiaries free from all claims of decedent's creditors. Whitson v. Tennessee C. R. Co., 163 Tenn. 35, 40 S.W.2d 396, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 136 (1931).

      <p>
       Where the father and mother of a child were divorced and the exclusive custody of such child awarded to the mother the mother was entitled to the proceeds of a recovery for the wrongful death of such child to the exclusion of the father since such proceeds follow the usual course for the distribution of personalty and under the provisions of § 31-201 (repealed) the mother is entitled to distribution of the personal estate of the child to the exclusion of the father under the above circumstances. Black v. Roberts, 172 Tenn. 20, 108 S.W.2d 1097, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       The recovery from the wrongful death of a child while not an asset of her estate in the sense that it was liable for her debts or could pass under her will or in other respects be treated as a legal asset nevertheless is to be distributed as surplus personal property. Black v. Roberts, 172 Tenn. 20, 108 S.W.2d 1097, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1937).
      </p>

       Recovery for wrongful death when realized becomes personal property and follows the distribution as such. Anderson v. Anderson, 211 Tenn. 566, 366 S.W.2d 755, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 381 (1963).
      </p>

       Father who had abandoned minor child prior to death of child was entitled to share in proceeds of recovery for wrongful death of child. Anderson v. Anderson, 211 Tenn. 566, 366 S.W.2d 755, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 381 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Divorce decree committed custody of child to mother to the exclusion of father within the meaning of § 31-201(4) (since repealed) so as to entitle mother to entirety of proceeds from recovery for wrongful death of such child where decree committed custody of such child with visitation rights to father. Damron v. Damron, 212 Tenn. 14, 367 S.W.2d 476, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 394 (1963).

      <p>
       The father and mother are the next of kin of their deceased child and share equally in the distribution of proceeds of a wrongful death action, and mother is a necessary party plaintiff. Jamison v. Memphis Transit Management Co., 381 F.2d 670, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5416 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1967).

       A fund received by a widow, as administratrix for the wrongful death of her husband, is not subject to her year's support, for only the assets of a deceased husband going into the hands of his personal representative and subject to the payment of debts is subject to be appropriated to the year's support of the widow. Throgmorton v. Oliver, 144 Tenn. 282, 230 S.W. 967, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1921); Powell v. Blake, 161 Tenn. 516, 33 S.W.2d 78, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1930).

       The widow is not entitled to the whole of the fund received by her as administratrix for the wrongful death of her husband, but such fund goes to her and the children in equal parts.

       Action by a child for his distributable share brought against widow who received entire recovery must be brought within six years after he attains his majority, the widow not being an express trustee. Jackson v. Dobbs, 154 Tenn. 602, 290 S.W. 402, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 158 (1926).

       Loss of consortium may be considered when calculating the pecuniary value of a deceased's life, and such losses are not limited to spousal claims but also necessarily encompass a child's loss, whether minor or adult.

       Loss of consortium consists of several elements, encompassing not only tangible services provided by a family member, but also intangible benefits each family member receives from the continued existence of other family members, including attention, guidance, care, protection, training, companionship, cooperation, affection, love and in the case of a spouse, sexual relations.

       While husband as administrator was neither a proper nor necessary party with husband individually in action for death of wife it was harmless error where same issues would have been made. Morrow v. Drumwright, 202 Tenn. 307, 304 S.W.2d 313, 1957 Tenn. LEXIS 392 (1957).
      </p>

       Administrator of deceased married woman's estate has legal capacity to maintain wrongful death action on behalf of estate of decedent and may do so without joining with him the party for whose benefit the action is brought under Tennessee law and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), 17(a), and 21. Lamar v. Stowers, 52 F.R.D. 490, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12339 (D. Tenn. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Surviving husband was a proper plaintiff in wrongful death action since the right of action is given first to the surviving spouse. Cline v. Richards, 455 F. Supp. 42, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14404 (E.D. Tenn. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a wrongful death action, where married deceased's parents had brought the action but the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the right of action, if any, passed to deceased's husband rather than to her parents, it was proper to allow substitution of deceased's husband as plaintiff in the action under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 17.01, even though the statute of limitations of one year had run prior to the filing of the motion for substitution, since the husband was the real party in interest and he made his application for substitution within a reasonable time after objection was made by defendants to the status of the original plaintiffs as real parties in interest. Chapman v. King, 572 S.W.2d 925, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 666 (Tenn. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to bring an action for damages for the wrongful death of the deceased married woman belongs to her husband, and not her parents. Chapman v. King, 572 S.W.2d 925, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 666 (Tenn. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two actions were filed for one death under this section they should have been consolidated and the proper plaintiff determined before proceeding to summary judgment which resulted from the confusion of the two actions. Matthews v. Mitchell, 705 S.W.2d 657, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3423 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The substitution of the administrator for an improper plaintiff was not error although the rightful party had a superior claim but did not object to the substitution. Matthews v. Mitchell, 705 S.W.2d 657, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3423 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in dismissing a daughter's wrongful death action against a decedent's husband on the ground that the husband, as the surviving spouse, was granted priority to prosecute the action because the husband's conduct was alleged to have caused the decedent's death, making him a potential wrongdoer; the husband had an inherent conflict, but his complaint did not name himself as a defendant nor include the allegation that he was a wrongdoer. Nelson v. Myres, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 29 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 18, 2017), rev'd, 545 S.W.3d 428, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Mar. 5, 2018).

       A surviving spouse, who knows that he has a right of action for wrongful death, waives his right when he fails to maintain control over it by either effecting a compromise or bringing the action to trial. Foster v. Jeffers, 813 S.W.2d 449, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Mar. 18, 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (Tenn. May 6, 1991).

       Where surviving spouse knowingly waived his right of action for wrongful death, he also waived his right to collect any proceeds from the wrongful death action. Foster v. Jeffers, 813 S.W.2d 449, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (Tenn. Mar. 18, 1991), appeal denied, 1991 Tenn. LEXIS 183 (Tenn. May 6, 1991).

       In a case where the surviving spouse has knowingly waived his right to bring a wrongful death action and there are no surviving children of the deceased, the right of action as well as the right to collect the proceeds therefrom pass to the next of kin.

       The statute embraced in this section is almost a literal transcript of the rule for the measurement of damages laid down in the case of Nashville & C. R. Co. v. Prince, 49 Tenn. 580, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1871); Railroad v. Wyrick, 99 Tenn. 500, 42 S.W. 434, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1897); Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The great fluctuation of judicial opinion as to what were the true elements of damage for the wrongful death of a person no doubt led to the passage of this section. Lougue v. Memphis & C. R. Co., 91 Tenn. 458, 19 S.W. 430 (1892); Chattanooga E. R. Co. v. Johnson, 97 Tenn. 667, 37 S.W. 558 (1896); Railroad v. Wyrick, 99 Tenn. 500, 42 S.W. 434, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute created no new, additional, or independent cause of action, but enlarged and regulated the measure of damages. Lougue v. Memphis & C. R. Co., 91 Tenn. 458, 19 S.W. 430 (1892); Whaley v. Catlett, 103 Tenn. 347, 53 S.W. 131, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1899); Elliott v. Felton, 119 F. 270, 1902 U.S. App. LEXIS 4665 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1902); Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999); Stuber v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 113 Tenn. 305, 87 S.W. 411, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1904); St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Leazer, 119 Tenn. 1, 107 S.W. 684, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1908).

       Provisions of Worker's Compensation Law for benefits to dependents held inapplicable to action for wrongful death of one not an employee. Potts v. Leigh, 15 Tenn. App. 1, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite allowance of certain damages to the beneficiaries, this statute creates no new right of action in the beneficiaries but preserves only the right of action of the deceased. Jones v. Black, 539 S.W.2d 123, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 572 (Tenn. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of damages is primarily a question for the jury and their verdict is entitled to great weight on appeal when the trial court has approved it, if there is no claim that the verdict is corrupt or dishonest. Strother v. Lane, 554 S.W.2d 631, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 266 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).

       The Tennessee wrongful death statutes, § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-106" target="_self">20-5-106</a></cite> and this section, are of the survival type, which simply preserve any action which the decedent would have had. Milligan v. American Hoist &amp; Derrick Co., 622 F. Supp. 56, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16397 (W.D. Tenn. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of this section does not in any way lead to the conclusion that a plaintiff's post-judgment death converts a personal injury action into a wrongful death action. Davis v. Jellico Community Hosp., Inc., 912 F.2d 129, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 14589 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1990).

       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-113" target="_self">20-5-113</a></cite> gives rise to a single cause of action vested in the representative of the decedent, under which two types of damages may be recovered: 1) Actual damages to the deceased, which include pain and suffering, medical expenses and funeral costs; and 2) Pecuniary value of the life of the deceased, based on life expectancy, age, condition of health and strength, capacity for labor and for earning money, and personal habits as to sobriety and industry. Alexander v. Beale St. Blues Co., 108 F. Supp. 2d 934, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22251 (W.D. Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrongful death beneficiaries'  claims against a nursing home arising from the death of a resident were subject to an arbitration agreement between the resident and the home; the wrongful death claim belonged to the resident's estate and not to the beneficiaries, so the beneficiaries were required to seek their damages in the arbitral forum agreed to by the estate. Wood v. Greenfield Assisted Living of Memphis, LLC, — F. Supp. 2d —, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179186 (W.D. Tenn. June 22, 2015).

      <p>
       The measure of damages for the wrongful killing of a person is actual compensation in all cases where the nature of the case admits of the application of the rule; and in cases involving mental and physical suffering that do not admit of being brought to an actual standard of value, some reasonable proportion between the circumstances attending the injury and the damages allowed should be observed by the jury. Louisville, N. & G. S. R.R. Co. v. Fleming, 82 Tenn. 128, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The pecuniary value of the life is its value to deceased's estate. The amount representing this value represents also the loss which the beneficiary has suffered, because he is entitled to the money as the substitute for the life of the deceased. Potts v. Leigh, 15 Tenn. App. 1, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Damages embracing pecuniary value of life of deceased are to be determined upon consideration of life expectancy of deceased, his age, condition of health and strength, his capacity if any for labor and earning money through skill in any art, trade, profession, occupation or business and his personal habits as to sobriety and industry. Interstate Life & Acci. Co. v. Cox, 55 Tenn. App. 40, 396 S.W.2d 80, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 238 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965); Southern R. Co. v. Sloan, 56 Tenn. App. 380, 407 S.W.2d 205, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 232 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965); Hensley v. Harbin, 782 S.W.2d 480, 1989 Tenn. App. LEXIS 304 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989); Thrailkill v. Patterson, 879 S.W.2d 836, 1994 Tenn. LEXIS 196 (Tenn. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In wrongful death action trial court should have instructed jury that for purpose of determining pecuniary value of decedent's life they should take into consideration the life expectancy of decedent, his age, the condition of his health, his strength, his capacity for work and earning money, his personal habits for sobriety and industry, all of these things to be modified by the fact that expectancy of life is at most a probability based upon experience and also modified by the fact that earnings of the same individual are not always the same and uniform. Newman v. Simmons, 62 Tenn. App. 610, 466 S.W.2d 506, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the elements of damage in wrongful death action is pecuniary value of life of decedent on the day he died. Newman v. Simmons, 62 Tenn. App. 610, 466 S.W.2d 506, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The pecuniary value of decedent's life under this section is the same as its value to his estate. Newman v. Simmons, 62 Tenn. App. 610, 466 S.W.2d 506, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sexual conduct of the deceased's mother who brought the wrongful death action had nothing to do with the deceased's capacity for work and personal habits. Tutor v. Bingham, 545 S.W.2d 944, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 262 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a party is in a weakened condition at the time of the injury is not a causal defense available to the defendant in a wrongful death action. Such condition may be material to the issue of life expectancy, but is not evidence as to the cause of the injury. Fuller v. Speight, 571 S.W.2d 840, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 302 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of commission of a crime by decedent is competent on the question of pecuniary value of decedent's life, and the court erred in excluding such testimony in this case. Hensley v. Harbin, 782 S.W.2d 480, 1989 Tenn. App. LEXIS 304 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1989).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In an action for the wrongful death of a person, the damages, recoverable in the one and same action, consist of two classes: the first class consists of damages purely for the injury to the deceased himself, and embraces damages for the mental and physical suffering, loss of time, and necessary expenses resulting to the deceased from personal injury; and the second class consists of the incidental damages suffered by the widow, children, or next of kin, from the death, and embraces the pecuniary value of the life of the deceased, to be determined upon the consideration of his expectancy of life, his age, condition of health and strength, his capacity of labor; and for earning money through skill in any art, trade, profession, occupation, or business, and his personal habits as to sobriety and industry; all modified, however, by the fact that the expectancy of life is at most only a probability, based upon experience, and also by the fact that the earnings of the same individual are not always uniform. Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999); Knoxville Ry. & Light Co. v. Davis, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 522 (1912); Potts v. Leigh, 15 Tenn. App. 1, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is but one cause of action embracing the first and second classes of damages contemplated by this section, namely, the action of the deceased, although the recovery may include damages sustained by persons to whom the statute gives the recovery. Potts v. Leigh, 15 Tenn. App. 1, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two doctors'  post-2001 failure to diagnose the decedent's prostate cancer, which allegedly led to the decedent's increased pain and suffering, did not entitle the decedent's children to damages for pain and suffering irrespective of their success as T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-113" target="_self">20-5-113</a></cite> set forth two classifications of damages available in successful wrongful death claims. Givens v. Josovitz, 343 S.W.3d 76, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 705 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2010), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2011 Tenn. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. Apr. 14, 2011).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Damages for the mental and physical suffering of the deceased are recoverable by those in whose favor the right of action survives. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Stacker, 86 Tenn. 343, 6 S.W. 737, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 52, 6 Am. St. Rep. 840 (1887); Railroad v. Wyrick, 99 Tenn. 500, 42 S.W. 434, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1897); Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Beneficiaries may recover for deceased's mental and physical suffering, though the declaration did not cover pain and suffering. Brown v. Ellison, 12 Tenn. App. 27, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 209 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in not allowing both of the estate representatives' claims for personal injuries and wrongful death to go to the jury, with the understanding that the representatives were not to have double recovery for the same damages, and to rule otherwise would have given no force and effect to the plain language of Tenn. Civ. Proc. Rule 8 and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-102" target="_self">20-5-102</a></cite>; under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-113" target="_self">20-5-113</a></cite>, the representatives were not able to recover pain and suffering damages under their wrongful death claim under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c05s20-5-106" target="_self">20-5-106</a></cite> and also under their personal injury claim, but this did not require that the personal injury claim be dismissed because the jury could have found that the nursing home injured the decedent but did not ultimately cause the decedent's death. Rolen v. Wood Presbyterian Home, Inc., 174 S.W.3d 158, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 278 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 974 (Tenn. Oct. 24, 2005).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The action for a wrongful death lies whether the death is instantaneous and simultaneous with the injuries, or occurs after an interval. Nashville & C. R. Co. v. Prince, 49 Tenn. 580, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1871); Fowlkes v. Nashville & D. R. Co., 56 Tenn. 829, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1872); Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Conner, 61 Tenn. 382, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 385 (1872); Trafford v. Adams Express Co., 76 Tenn. 96, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1881); Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the death is instantaneous, there can be no compensation for mental and physical suffering of the deceased. Nashville &amp; C. R. Co. v. Prince, 49 Tenn. 580, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1871); Nashville &amp; C.R.R. v. Smith, 53 Tenn. 174, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 339 (Tenn. Sep. 30, 1871); Trafford v. Adams Express Co., 76 Tenn. 96, 1881 Tenn.

       The question whether the injured person suffered mental or physical pain, where death was instantaneous, is a question for the jury. Western & A. R. Co. v. Roberson, 61 F. 592, 1894 U.S. App. LEXIS 2210 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1894).

       The incidental damages suffered by the next of kin are such as the deceased himself could have recovered had he been permanently disabled for life, and were himself prosecuting the suit. This measure of damages represents the pecuniary value of the life of the deceased, which the beneficiaries under the statute are entitled to recover as the pecuniary damages sustained by them. To allow them to recover both what the decedent might have recovered himself for permanent disability for life and what they have sustained as pecuniary damages consequent upon the death is to allow duplicate damages for the one life. There is no warrant for the allowance of duplicate damages. Davidson Benedict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1903), overruled, Jordan v.

       In actions for personal injuries resulting in death, the measure of damages is actual compensation where the nature of the case admits of the application of the rule; but in cases where the elements of malice, gross negligence, willfulness, wantonness, or cruelty enter into the wrong done, the interest of society and that of the aggrieved party are blended, and the jury in such cases may, in its discretion, award exemplary, vindictive, or punitive damages.

       The allowance of exemplary damages, when warranted by the pleadings and the proof, is left to the sound discretion of the jury; and an instruction in such case that such damages must or should be assessed, or that it is not only the jury's right, but its duty, to do so, is erroneous.

An instruction to the jury that age, earning capacity, and character of citizenship of the deceased should be looked to in fixing damages was erroneous in the absence of proof on the subject. Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Dial, 16 Tenn. App. 646, 65 S.W.2d 610, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

       Where error in jury instructions results in damages being awarded on behalf of decedent without evidence being adduced as to pecuniary value of that life, the award will not be overturned where there is ample evidence at trial of other grounds for jury's verdict.

       In an action for the wrongful death of a wife, an instruction, “If you find in favor of the plaintiff, it will be your duty to fix the amount of his recovery. The measure of the recovery would be reasonable compensation for the life of the deceased. In determining that, take into consideration her age, the state of her health, her expectancy of life, of a person of her state of health and age, and let your verdict be for reasonable compensation,” was held not to be prejudicially erroneous against the defendant, although the trial court should have charged the jury that the measure of damages was the pecuniary value of the life of the deceased, and not any sentimental value which the jury might place on the deceased's life, and, further, in arriving at the value of the life, it should be taken into consideration that at best the duration of life is uncertain. Hines v. Partridge, 144 Tenn. 219, 231 S.W. 16, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       In death action it was error to charge the jury that it might look to the age of deceased and his earning capacity where there was no evidence as to his earning capacity, state of health, life expectancy, or amount of wages earned. Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Dial, 16 Tenn. App. 646, 65 S.W.2d 610, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alleged error of trial court in action for death of 5½ year old boy in charging that loss of services during the child's minority was an element to consider in arriving at damages was not prejudicial where the amount of the award was $5,000 and the child was physically and mentally normal as the value of the life of such child was not less than that amount regardless of the alleged erroneous charge. Bradshaw v. Holt, 200 Tenn. 249, 292 S.W.2d 30, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 403 (1956).

      <p>
       Instructions in wrongful death action that jury could consider circumstances and condition of decedent's wife, the services he would have performed for his wife, the portion of his earnings he would have in the future applied to care and support of his wife and the life expectancy of his wife constituted reversible error. Newman v. Simmons, 62 Tenn. App. 610, 466 S.W.2d 506, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 289 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).

       Wife's administrator may not maintain action for wrongful death of wife as result of unlawful assault of her husband. There is no new cause of action created, and deceased had none. Wilson v. Barton, 153 Tenn. 250, 283 S.W. 71, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1926); Tobin v. Gelrich, 162 Tenn. 96, 34 S.W.2d 1058, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1931), overruled in part, Davis v.

      </p>
      <p>
       If there are no children or descendants of children, the surviving husband alone, to the exclusion of the wife' next of kin, is entitled to the recovery, although the action must be by an administrator. Potts v. Leigh, 15 Tenn. App. 1, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).

       It is not material that the deceased wife and her husband had been estranged and lived apart, since it does not affect the pecuniary value of the wife's life. Potts v. Leigh, 15 Tenn. App. 1, — S.W.2d —, 1931 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1931).

       Wrongful Death Act does not provide for recovery for grief or loss of consortium by the decedent's children. Still v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., 755 S.W.2d 807, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 315 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988), questioned, Taylor v. Beard, 104 S.W.3d 507, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 165 (2003).

       Depending on the facts of the relationship, a parent may recover loss of consortium damages as an element of the pecuniary value of the child's life. Alexander v. Beale St. Blues Co., 108 F. Supp. 2d 934, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22251 (W.D. Tenn. 1999).

       Loss of consortium may be considered when calculating the pecuniary value of a deceased's life. Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Loss of consortium consists of several elements, encompassing not only tangible services provided by a family member, but also intangible benefits each family member receives from the continued existence of other family members, including attention, guidance, care, protection, training, companionship, cooperation, affection, love and in the case of a spouse, sexual relations. Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The holding in Jordan v. Baptist Three Rivers Hosp., 984 S.W.2d 593, 1999 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (Tenn. 1999) that loss of consortium may be considered when calculating the pecuniary value of a deceased's life and that such claims may encompass a child's loss, applies retroactively to: (1) All cases tried or retried after the date of the Jordan decision; and (2) All cases pending on appeal in which the issue decided in Jordan was raised at an appropriate time. Hill v. City of Germantown, 31 S.W.3d 234, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 587 (Tenn. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on a decedent's parents' claim for loss of filial consortium in a wrongful death action; a new trial was necessary only as to consortium damages as it was clear that the jury's damages award was limited to the decedent's pain and suffering. Rothstein v. Orange Grove Ctr., 60 S.W.3d 807, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 808 (Tenn. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the term “pecuniary value” includes consortium-like damages, children of the deceased were not limited in their recovery to medical and funeral expenses and loss of earning capacity; their award could include incidental damages, including loss of consortium, and therefore, the court's award of $300,000 to the decedent's children was not excessive. Knowles v. State, 49 S.W.3d 330, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 120 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 549 (Tenn. July 2, 2001).

       Loss of consortium may be considered when calculating the pecuniary value of a deceased's life, and such losses are not limited to spousal claims but also necessarily encompass a child's loss, whether minor or adult.

      </p>

       The age of the child does not, in and of itself, preclude consideration of parental consortium damages, and the adult child inquiry shall take into consideration factors such as closeness of the relationship and dependence (i.e., of a handicapped adult child, assistance with day care, etc.).

       Decedent's children did not have a separate claim but one indivisible cause of action existed, the cause of action the decedent would have had, absent death, against the wrongdoer; therefore, the decedent's survivors were only permitted to assert the cause of action in a representative capacity on the decedent's behalf. Beard v. Branson, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 233 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2016), rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 287 (Tenn. Ct.

       In suit by conservator to have certain deeds of a decedent declared invalid, where plaintiff died prior to submission of case to jury it was error for the trial court to proceed with the submission of the case to the jury without revivor in the name of the proper party complainants and in withholding from the jury the information of the plaintiff's death, however such error was not reversible where no assignment of error was made to this action of the court.

       Where, in action brought by conservator, court erred in submitting case to jury after receiving word that complainant had died, the action of the chancellor in reviving the cause in the name of the proper parties complainant after the verdict of the jury was received but before a decree was entered cured all defects resulting from the failure of the chancellor to require the cause to be revived before the submission of the case to the jury.

       The beneficiaries of a fund assigned by a corporation, afterwards becoming dissolved by expiration of its charter, may in chancery enforce their rights, on the principle that the death of the nominal plaintiff suing for the use of another will not abate the latter's suit. Ingraham v. Terry, 30 Tenn. 572, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1851); State v. Bank of Tennessee, 62 Tenn. 395, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1874); Kyle v. Ewing, 73 Tenn. 580, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 187 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the express provision of the statute, upon the death of the nominal plaintiff, the suit may be prosecuted without revivor, as if death had not happened; and there could be no good reason why the same rule should not apply where the nominal plaintiff is a corporation, and becomes defunct pending the action. Kyle v. Ewing, 73 Tenn. 580, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 187 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though corporation ceased to exist before action was brought the unnecessary use of the name of the defunct corporation may be rejected as surplusage. Kyle v. Ewing, 73 Tenn. 580, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 187 (1880).

         Where appellees' three prior suits were all based on the inter vivos actions which decedent took with regard to her property, but the present claim, to the contrary, was founded on her testamentary actions, these claims were distinct and separate both in character and in time and were to be governed not by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01(2) but by this section. Wright v. Wright, 832 S.W.2d 542, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 748 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991).

         In this breach of a commercial lease agreement case, the dispositive issue was whether the landlord was entitled to recover damages, not whether it could bring a successive action on the same contract or transaction when a new cause of action arose; as the jury found that the landlord did not suffer any damages, whether the landlord was entitled to an instruction on successive actions was moot. Even if the trial court erred by excluding the instruction, it was harmless because it resulted in no prejudice. Bop, LLC v. Plastic Surgery of Nashville, P.C., — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn.

         Where church executed series of notes secured by deed of trust and also by guaranty of individual church members to repurchase notes on default, holders of unmatured notes were not necessary parties to suit by holders of matured notes to enforce guaranty against such individual church members since the holders of unmatured notes did not have the right under the acceleration clause contained in the deed of trust to declare their notes matured and consequently full relief could be granted holders of matured notes without prejudicing rights of holders of unmatured notes who under this section would have a right to maintain an action for breach of covenant to repurchase if and when their notes should be in default.

       Given the length of time the proceeding had been pending, the fact that trial had already been continued once, the fact that Husband was aware of the consequences of not retaining counsel (i.e., that he would represent himself), the fact that the husband was not guaranteed the assistance of counsel in the instant civil proceeding, and the lack of any attestations to the court of the husband's diligence in attempting to locate new counsel, no abuse of discretion was discerned in the trial court's decision to proceed with trial despite the withdrawal of the husband's counsel, especially when no motion or request for a continuance was actually made.

      <p>
       The granting or refusing of continuances, both in criminal and civil cases, and in the chancery and circuit courts, rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion which the appellate or Supreme Court will not readily revise or interfere with, except in a clear case of great abuse of the discretion. Hammonds v. Kemer, 4 Tenn. 145, 1816 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1816); Cornwell v. State, 8 Tenn. 147, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1827); Rhea v. State, 18 Tenn. 258, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1837); Goodman v.

      <p>
       Under the practice existing prior to the adoption of this section, the reception of an answer, after a bill had been taken pro confesso, and the giving of further delay for the hearing, were discretionary and allowable upon good cause shown, and the court could allow the one and refuse the other. Scales v. Nichols, 4 Tenn. 228, 4 Tenn. 229, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1817).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court will interfere with the exercise of judicial discretion by the inferior court, when it is not properly employed, and when, without interference, injustice will be done. Cheek v. Merchants Nat'l Bank, 56 Tenn. 489, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 165 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuances rest in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and that discretion should always be exercised so as to secure as speedy a settlement of the litigation as may be consistent with the orderly and correct disposition of business and administration of justice; and no continuance ought to be allowed unless it be made clearly to appear to the court that it is necessary for the attainment of justice. Fox v. State, 111 Tenn. 154, 76 S.W. 815, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1903); Stockley v. Cissna, 119 Tenn. 135, 104 S.W. 792, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1907).

       There is no error in refusing to continue the hearing or argument on a motion for a new trial, upon the application of the defendants in a capital case, without affidavit showing cause, and there is no error in refusing an hour's time to prepare such affidavit, unless some good ground is stated for so long a time. Barnard v. State, 88 Tenn. 183, 12 S.W. 431, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1889).
      </p>
      <p>
       An application for a continuance by the defendant in a criminal case is properly disallowed, when not supported by an affidavit. Mitchell v. State, 92 Tenn. 668, 23 S.W. 68, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant, when the cause was called for trial, asked for a continuance because no issue had been taken on his plea of the statute of limitations, it was not error for the court to direct a formal joinder of issue upon the plea, which was done, and to refuse a continuance without affidavit showing cause, especially where it does not appear, either by affidavit for a continuance or for a new trial, that any injury resulted from the court's action. Morgan v. Duffy, 94 Tenn. 686, 30 S.W. 735, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1895).

       The absence of the defendant in a civil suit, on account of sickness, is a ground for a continuance, where it appears from the affidavit of his attorney that he is a material witness for his own defense, and it is not necessary that he be subpoenaed as a witness. Douglass v. Blakemore, 59 Tenn. 564, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no error in refusing the defendant, in a felony case, a continuance upon affidavit for the absence of witnesses whose testimony he desired, when he does not deny his guilt or indicate any defense to the charge, either in his affidavit or upon the trial. Crane v. State, 94 Tenn. 86, 28 S.W. 317, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1894); Fox v. State, 111 Tenn. 154, 76 S.W. 815, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       An application for continuance of a murder case is properly denied, although at a special term, where the affidavit fails to disclose the facts that the absent witness is expected to prove. Leach v. State, 99 Tenn. 584, 42 S.W. 195, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       An affidavit in support of an application for a continuance on account of absent witnesses, whether offered at the first or a subsequent trial term, should be special and state the names and residences of the witnesses, and the facts expected to be proved by each of them, in addition to the usual requisites of such affidavits, so that the court may judge whether the evidence desired is relevant, competent, and material. Fox v. State, 111 Tenn. 154, 76 S.W. 815, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1903); Shoun v. State, 111 Tenn. 166, 78 S.W. 91, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a continuance was sought on the ground of absence of a witness, but according to the affidavit his testimony would only have been cumulative, the court was justified in refusing the continuance. Franer v. English, 8 Tenn. App. 121, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 117 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       Where the court properly refused to grant a second continuance, on account of the absence of a certain witness, neither the party applying therefor, nor his counsel, could prevent a trial of the case by withdrawing from the courtroom and refusing to introduce any testimony.

       Where attorney in criminal case for defendant asked continuance, and, same being refused, withdrew from the case and the court appointed another who proceeded to trial without asking for continuance, there was no error in not granting a continuance.

       The court may call the docket on the first day of the term for the disposal of unlitigated and undefended causes, and the exercise of such discretion and practice cannot be assigned as error in the supreme court. Chrisman v. Curle, 18 Tenn. 488, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 63 (1837); Lynn v. Polk, 76 Tenn. 328, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1881).

       Where, at the instance of the plaintiff, time to file declaration was granted until the second term, such term is the return term, and not the trial term, as to defendant, and there cannot be a trial at that term, without his consent.

       A special term of the circuit court, held between the appearance term of a cause and the next regular term, is not the trial term thereof; and a verdict and judgment rendered at such special term, without consent, is reversible error, for which a new trial will be granted.

       A general continuance, or a continuance to the next term, makes the cause triable at an intervening special term; but this result may be obviated by a special continuance to the regular term. Hall v. Mount, Hall & Co., 43 Tenn. 73, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1866).

       While this provision is not imperative, but leaves the judge to exercise a proper discretion, yet it is so far obligatory that an arbitrary departure from it resulting in the defeat of justice is error. Memphis & O. R. R. Co. v. Dowd, 56 Tenn. 179, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 123 (1872).

          This section requires opening statements to be made prior to the presentation of any evidence. The failure of the defendant to request the opportunity to make an opening statement prior to the presentation of the state's first witness waived any right to make such statement. State v.

          The court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow defendant to reserve his opening statement until the beginning of the defense's proof. State v. Harris, 839 S.W.2d 54, 1992 Tenn.

          A criminal defendant has no right to make an opening statement at any other time except prior to the presentation of any evidence in the case. State v. Harris, 839 S.W.2d 54, 1992 Tenn.

          Because opening statements are not evidence, the trial court did not err in holding that under this section a defendant has no right to reserve his opening statement until the close of the state's evidence.

          Defendant's contention that the trial court improperly restricted his opening statement, was meritless, for the defendant's attorney injected argument into the opening statement, and while the trial court's interruption may have been premature, defense counsel was allowed to make his point.

          No error in the State's opening statements regarding the video evidence and the identity of defendant as the seller of the drugs affected the outcome of the trial to defendant's prejudice because the jury was able to view the video, which delivered a clear view of the offender, to determine the issue of identity; the prosecution presented a witness who was familiar with defendant and who identified him as the lone person in the vehicle used in the drug transaction; and defendant was in possession of over $300 in cash and digital scales with cocaine residue.

         <p>
          Opening statement and the closing argument were improper because they were calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury and that the prosecutor referred to or argued facts “outside the record,” some of which were not “matters of common public knowledge”; the “safer streets” argument made by the prosecution strayed too far from the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.

           Where plaintiff obtained a judgment against two defendants, one of whom was not served with process, the judgment was void as to such defendant and might be considered as an automatic or informal dismissal as to such defendant.

           The reversal and remandment by the federal appellate court to the lower federal court, with directions “to grant a new trial, to sustain the plea of the statute of limitations to the declaration as amended, and to enter judgment for the defendant,” does not make a new trial compulsory, but the plaintiff may, after the mandate has been received, and orders made thereon as directed, take a voluntary nonsuit.

           The common law courts of this state do not have jurisdiction, like courts of equity, to enter decrees dismissing actions “without prejudice” to plaintiff's right to sue defendant again on the same cause or “with prejudice” to such right and the decisive test as to whether or not plaintiff can bring his action again is whether or not such dismissal was on the merits. Long v. Kirby-Smith, 40 Tenn. App. 446, 292 S.W.2d 216, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 155 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956), superseded by statute as stated in, Lovelace v. State, — S.W.2d —, 1989 Tenn. Crim.

           Circuit court could order a dismissal upon motion for a nonsuit but could not decree a dismissal with prejudice under such circumstances and words “with full prejudice” contained in such an order were mere surplusage. Long v. Kirby-Smith, 40 Tenn. App. 446, 292 S.W.2d 216, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 155 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956), superseded by statute as stated in, Lovelace v. State, — S.W.2d —, 1989 Tenn. Crim.

           Where in action for personal injuries plaintiff executed a covenant not to sue as to all but one of the joint tort-feasors against whom he had brought suit and thereafter counsel for plaintiff and for those defendants with whom the covenants had been executed entered a consent order without knowledge of plaintiff purporting to dismiss the suit “with full prejudice” as to the aforementioned defendants, such order did not operate to release or discharge the remaining tort-feasor but only meant dismissal with the full prejudice as provided in such covenants.

           On the trial of all civil cases, it is the duty of the judge before whom the civil case is tried, at the request of either party, plaintiff or defendant, to reduce every word of the judge's charge to the jury to writing before it is delivered to the jury, and all subsequent instructions that may be asked for by the jury, or that may be given by the judge, shall, in like manner, be reduced to writing before being delivered to the jury.

            This statute is mandatory, and the court's failure to comply strictly with the request for a written charge constitutes reversible error, although it does not appear that any exception was taken on that account in the lower court, or that any injury thereby resulted.

            There is nothing in this section which requires the trial judge to sign the written charge which he reads to the jury, nor to physically deliver such written charge to the jury to be taken into the jury room with them; the strict requirements of this section having been fully met when the trial judge reduces every word of his charge to the jury to writing, reads that written charge to them, and does not deliver one word of his charge to them orally.

            This section and former statute relating to charges in civil and criminal cases were separate and distinct acts; and the positive requirement of the statute relating to criminal cases that that the jury shall take the charge out with them upon their retirement could not be read into the statute relating to civil cases by judicial interpretation when that provision does not appear in the statute relating to civil cases.

            There is nothing in this section requiring the court to permit the jury to have physical possession of the written charge and former statute requiring the written charge to be delivered to the jury in felony cases in no way amended or restricted the provisions of this section.

           <p>
            Privilege of jury to decline finding any other than a general verdict is not restrained by this statute. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
           </p>
           <p>
            A jury may return a general verdict at the same time it responds to interrogatories submitted by the court, and if the findings on the interrogatories are insufficient to warrant a judgment, the court may act upon the general verdict and deal with it as if there had been no findings on the interrogatories. Lenoir Car Works v. Littleton, 41 Tenn. App. 323, 293 S.W.2d 585, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 171 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
           </p>
           <p>
            In negligence case where jury rendered general verdict in favor of plaintiff, court held that this section has been applied in diversity cases where a general verdict was rendered on basis of at least one properly submitted issue which was supported by substantial evidence even though other claims may have been improperly submitted. Watts v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 491 F.2d 601, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10179 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1974).

           <p>
            Where there are several issues, they must all be found by the jury before judgment can be pronounced, though the response need not be in technical or specific terms. Kennel v. Muncey, 7 Tenn. 273, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1823); Carter v. Graves, 17 Tenn. 446 (1836); Crutcher v. Williams, 23 Tenn. 345, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 109 (1842); Kirkpatrick v. S. W. R.

           <p>
            Sections 20-9-502 and 20-9-503 must be read in pari materia and are not applicable in favor of a defendant whose liability was not considered by the jury because of an erroneous instruction. Wilson v. Tranbarger, 218 Tenn. 208, 402 S.W.2d 449, 1965 Tenn. LEXIS 512 (1965).

            By analogy to this section, if either of two findings standing alone would have invalidated a codicil, and if one of the findings was not affected by any substantial error on the trial, then that finding will support a judgment refusing probate of the codicil. Hager v. Hager, 17 Tenn. App. 143, 66 S.W.2d 250, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

            Verdict supported by two good counts held valid though third count was faulty. Anderson v. Read, 2 Tenn. 205, 1813 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1812).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where there are several counts, a general verdict will be applied to those counts sustained by the evidence, though there be no evidence to sustain the other counts. East T., V. & G. R.R. Co. v. Gurley, 80 Tenn. 46, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 138 (1883); Tennessee Cent. Ry. v. Umenstetter, 155 Tenn. 235, 291 S.W. 452, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1926).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where verdict was general and not special with respect to the two separate counts of the declaration, and there was material evidence to support one count, the verdict of the jury concurred in by trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal, even though there is no evidence in the record to support the other count. Sledge & Norfleet v. Bondurant, 5 Tenn. App. 319, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 65 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).
           </p>
           <p>
            General verdict returned by the jury may well be referred to a count which there was evidence to support. Wilson v. Moudy, 22 Tenn. App. 356, 123 S.W.2d 828, 1938 Tenn. App. LEXIS 36 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1938).
           </p>
           <p>
            Verdicts must be applied to the good counts in declaration. Schumpert v. Moore, 24 Tenn. App. 695, 149 S.W.2d 471, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 83 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940); Tutton v. Patterson, 714 S.W.2d 268, 1986 Tenn. LEXIS 776 (Tenn. 1986).
           </p>
           <p>
            Under this section a general verdict is not vitiated by the absence of proof on some counts of the declaration if there is evidence to sustain the averments of a single count. Taylor v. Cobble, 28 Tenn. App. 167, 187 S.W.2d 648, 1945 Tenn. App. LEXIS 64 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1945); City Transp. Corp. v. Seckler, 32 Tenn. App. 661, 225 S.W.2d 288, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949); Wesco Paving Co. v. Nash, 35 Tenn. App. 409, 245 S.W.2d 782, 1951 Tenn. App. LEXIS 82 (1951); Central Truckaway System, Inc. v. Waltner, 36 Tenn. App. 202, 253 S.W.2d 985, 1952 Tenn. App. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1952).
           </p>
           <p>
            General verdict if supported by evidence on one or more counts is good though there is a lack of proof on other counts. White v. Seier, 37 Tenn. App. 437, 264 S.W.2d 241, 1953 Tenn. App. LEXIS 99 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1953).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where jury returned a general verdict on two counts, Court of Appeals was bound to affirm verdict on good count about which no question was made even though it was contended that the verdict on the other count was erroneous. Lenoir Car Works v. Littleton, 41 Tenn. App. 323, 293 S.W.2d 585, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 171 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
           </p>
           <p>
            In action for damages from railroad crossing accident where case was correctly submitted to jury on both statutory and common law counts there could be no reversal even if the court erred in its submission of the last clear chance doctrine to the jury. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Rochelle, 252 F.2d 730, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3759 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1958).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where case was tried on negligence and also on breach of implied warranty, and negligence count was good, the fact that district judge found that it was improper to submit the case on breach of implied warranty was not ground to grant a new trial, since the Tennessee law must be applied in diversity cases. Tracy v. Finn Equipment Co., 290 F.2d 498, 1961 U.S. App. LEXIS 4565 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1961), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">368 U.S. 826</cite>, <cite class="s_court">82 S. Ct. 47</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">7 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 30, 1961 U.S. LEXIS 506 (1961).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where first count was sustained by evidence and charge of the court had no relevancy to issue raised by that count, the giving of a charge applicable to second count was not prejudicial error. Flannagan v. Lee, 56 Tenn. App. 600, 409 S.W.2d 385, 1966 Tenn. App. LEXIS 239 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1966).
           </p>
           <p>
            A general verdict is not vitiated by absence of proof on some counts of the declaration if there is evidence to sustain the averments of a single count. Clinchfield R. Co. v. Forbes, 57 Tenn. App. 174, 417 S.W.2d 210, 1966 Tenn. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1966).
           </p>
           <p>
            In absence of an affirmative showing that the jury found liability under a count of the declaration unsupported by evidence, the judgment will not be reversed by the failure of the trial judge to direct a verdict upon a count not sustained by proof. Clinchfield R. Co. v. Forbes, 57 Tenn. App. 174, 417 S.W.2d 210, 1966 Tenn. App. LEXIS 203 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1966).
           </p>
           <p>
            A general verdict in favor of plaintiff without separate verdicts on separate counts is presumed to rest upon a valid count and will not be set aside even though one count be defective. Osborne v. Frazor, 58 Tenn. App. 15, 425 S.W.2d 768, 1968 Tenn. App. LEXIS 292, 35 A.L.R.3d 338 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1968), superseded by statute as stated in, Crawford v. Family Vision Center, Inc., — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 810 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 1990).
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though the trial court erred by instructing the jury on a post-sale duty to warn, as such a duty was not recognized in Tennessee, because the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the parents'  remaining theories of recovery under their wrongful death claim, the error was harmless, and the court affirmed the entry of judgment for the parents as to the jury's wrongful death compensatory award. Flax v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 822 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2006), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 272 S.W.3d 521, 2008 Tenn. LEXIS 505 (Tenn. July 24, 2008).

City Transp. Corp. v. Seckler, 32 Tenn. App. 661, 225 S.W.2d 288, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).

            Under a general verdict finding all issues for plaintiff the court of appeals cannot weigh the evidence to determine its preponderance but can only determine whether there is any substantial evidence to support the verdict, and this rule applies not only as to liability but also to injuries on which the amount of damages is based.

            To poll the jury means to ascertain by questions to jurors, individually, whether each assents to the verdict. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

           <p>
            The object of polling the jury is for the purpose of ascertaining for a certainty the individual juror's verdict and it is not to determine the mode in which they arrived at the verdict. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

           <p>
            Since the statute does not provide a method of polling the jury, the method of conducting the poll is entirely within the discretion of the trial judge and his judgment will not be disturbed unless it clearly appears that there was an abuse of discretion. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956); Lovell v. McCullough, 222 Tenn. 567, 439 S.W.2d 105, 1969 Tenn.

           </p>
           <p>
            Where in polling jury the trial judge instead of calling the names of the last nine jurors pointed to each and asked, “Is it or not yours?” and each juror replied, “Yes,” the polling of the jury met the requirements of the statute. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
           </p>
           <p>
            No particular form of answer is essential on the polling of the jury, it being sufficient if the answer of the jury indicates with reasonable certainty that the verdict is his own. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956); Lovell v. McCullough, 222 Tenn. 567, 439 S.W.2d 105, 1969 Tenn.

           </p>
           <p>
            The poll of each member of the jury on the question of whether the verdict rendered is the verdict of each juror represents the extent to which the court may go in inquiring of the jurors as to the method of reaching their verdict. Lovell v. McCullough, 222 Tenn. 567, 439 S.W.2d 105, 1969 Tenn. LEXIS 463 (1969).

            Where jury returned general verdict against three alleged tort-feasors in action for personal injuries and wrongful death arising out of motor vehicle accident, polling jury by asking in substance whether verdict against automobile driver was verdict of each juror was error.

            It was the duty of the trial judge to ascertain if the verdict returned was that of each individual juror and the asking by the trial judge of leading questions to obtain this fact was not reversible error. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

            Where juror upon being polled stated, “We figured they both was at fault,” but upon being questioned by the trial judge stated that the finding of the juror for the plaintiff was his verdict the statement of the juror was not grounds for a mistrial. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
           </p>
           <p>
            Refusal of trial judge during the polling of the jury to permit juror to address court after inquiring if he could “say something” did not constitute reversible error even though according to juror's affidavit he would have informed court that the jury disregarded negligence and fault in arriving at its verdict where such juror stated twice during the polling that the verdict was his individual verdict and nothing appeared to the contrary.

           <p>
            Where one juror, in response to question of court after return of verdict, as to whether that was the verdict of twelve jurors stated that he was on the other side but he went along with them, and no application for a poll was made as provided by this section, it would seem that this one juror was reluctant but was persuaded by the others which is not prohibited. Donahue v. George, 46 Tenn. App. 320, 329 S.W.2d 836, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 103 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).

            A juror will not be permitted to impeach his verdict by later making affidavit the substance of which shows that he did not fairly try the case as he had taken oath to do. Dixon Stave & Heading Co. v. Archer, 40 Tenn. App. 327, 291 S.W.2d 603, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 153 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

           <p>
            Trial court did not err in refusing to order jurors into court for questioning based on juror's affidavit that the jury disregarded negligence and fault in arriving at its verdict.

           </h4>
           <p>
            The trial judge is only required to poll the jury upon application of one of the parties. Nance v. State, 210 Tenn. 328, 358 S.W.2d 327, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 443 (1962).
           </p>
           <p>
            Where state failed to request that jury be polled it lost standing to complain as to lack of certainty or form of the verdict. Whitwell v. State, 520 S.W.2d 338, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 701 (Tenn. 1975).
           </p>
           <p>
            Petitioner failed to show that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to poll the jury at the conclusion of the trial, and therefore he was properly denied postconviction relief, because there was no indication that the jury verdict was not unanimous. Whitehair v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 138 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 26, 2020), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. LEXIS 463 (Tenn. July 17, 2020).

           <p>
            Right to poll jury verdict was waived where no request was made when jury reported verdict in principal suit but was only made when jury subsequently brought in verdict in dependent suit. Ball v. Mallinkrodt Chemical Works, 53 Tenn. App. 218, 381 S.W.2d 563, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 96, 19 A.L.R.3d 813 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
           </p>
           <p>
            The right to have the jury polled is not a constitutional right but one conferred by statute and will be considered waived unless requested at time verdict is returned. Ball v. Mallinkrodt Chemical Works, 53 Tenn. App. 218, 381 S.W.2d 563, 1964 Tenn. App. LEXIS 96, 19 A.L.R.3d 813 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1964).
           </p>
           <p>
            Defendant waived any question about the verdict of the jury by his failure to object and demand that the jury be polled at the time of the verdict. Rice v. State, 4 Tenn. Crim. App. 600, 475 S.W.2d 178, 1971 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 430 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1971).

             The general assembly finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to promote the skill, art and practice of court reporting in order to assure that court reporters possess the necessary skills and qualifications and that a board be established to prescribe the qualifications of court reporters and to issue licenses to persons who demonstrate their ability and fitness for the licenses. This part is intended to establish and maintain a standard of competency for individuals engaged in the practice of court reporting and for the protection of the public, in general, and for the litigants whose rights to personal freedom and property are affected by the competency of court reporters. The examination, licensing and supervision of the conduct and proficiency of court reporters are integrally related to the effective, impartial and prompt operation of the judicial system of the state.

         In cases where, in the opinion of the trial judge, a jury verdict is not adequate to compensate the plaintiff or plaintiffs in compensatory damages or punitive damages, the trial judge may suggest an additur in such amount or amounts as the trial judge deems proper to the compensatory or punitive damages awarded by the jury, or both such classes of damages.

       Where the trial judge was allowed to increase the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiff by the jury, the defendant's constitutional rights to a trial by jury were not violated because an additur was conditioned on the consent of the defendant. McCall v. Waer, 487 S.W.2d 308, 1972 Tenn. LEXIS 324 (Tenn. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The additur statute as applied to a nonconsenting plaintiff does not violate the right to trial by jury unless the jury verdict is so low as to evince prejudice, passion, or caprice, since the plaintiff is entitled to only one fair trial not two; accordingly, where the evidence was such as could reasonably have led the jury to disbelieve plaintiff's special damages, denial of new trial conditioned upon additur did not violate plaintiff's rights. Kaiser v. Cannon, 529 S.W.2d 235, 1975 Tenn. App. LEXIS 174 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1975). See case note under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c10s20-10-102" target="_self">20-10-102</a></cite>.

       In suit for damages to hoisting equipment by railroad switch engine where jury awarded owner of hoisting equipment less than the undisputed amount of damages to equipment, trial court did not err in failing to suggest additur where under the facts of the case jury could have considered remote contributory negligence as mitigating damages. Gardner's Masonry Contractors, Inc. v. St. Louis S. F. R. Co., 63 Tenn. App. 288, 470 S.W.2d 945, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 221 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971), criticized, Street v.

       Where the trial judge declined to suggest an additur, the Court of Appeals was not authorized to initiate an additur for the first time on appeal. Loftis v. Finch, 491 S.W.2d 370, 1972 Tenn. App. LEXIS 279 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972).
      </p>

       In eminent domain case where parties stipulated there were no incidental expenses, it was error as a matter of law for court to suggest an additur for moving expenses which are incidental expenses. State ex rel. Smith v. Huffaker, 503 S.W.2d 106, 1973 Tenn. LEXIS 435 (Tenn. 1973).

       Where the jury's verdict in wrongful death action was not within the “range of reasonableness,” the trial court should have suggested an additur or granted a new trial. Wilkerson v.

       The remittitur and additur statutes were enacted for the purpose of giving the plaintiff, in the case of remittiturs, and the defendant, in the case of additurs, the right to accept, under protest, and appeal, a right that had been denied those respective classes of litigants by case law prior to the enactment of such statutes.

       If it is determined on appeal that the jury's verdict is within the range of reasonableness or that both the jury's and the trial judge's awards are within that range, the appellate court must restore the jury verdict; if only the trial judge's award is within the range, it must be affirmed; if neither are within the range of reasonableness, the court of appeals should make appropriate use of remittitur or additur and render judgment within the range of reasonableness based upon the credible proof of damages. Smith v. Shelton, 569 S.W.2d 421, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. 1978), overruled in part, Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn.

       Where a case is tried with the intervention of a jury, the appeal is expressly governed by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c03s27-3-108ol1repealed" target="_blank">27-3-108 (repealed)</a></cite>, being in the nature of a writ of error, and neither the trial judge's disagreement with the amount of the jury verdict, nor acceptance of a remittitur or additur rather than a new trial, provides a basis for the application of § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c03s27-3-103ol1repealed" target="_blank">27-3-103 (repealed)</a></cite>.

       Appellate review of a trial judge's actions in making use of remittitur or additur resolves into a determination of whether or not the jury verdict is within the range of reasonableness established by the credible proof and throughout the review, the jury's determinations should be given primary weight and the trial judge's secondary weight. Smith v. Shelton, 569 S.W.2d 421, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. 1978), overruled in part, Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn.

       Even though the court of appeals is not satisfied with the amount of a verdict, it has no authority to suggest an additur to correct the failure of the trial judge to do so. State ex rel. Shaw v. Shofner, 573 S.W.2d 169, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 312 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).

       This section imposes no standard of review upon an appellate court reviewing the grant of an additur. Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn.

      <p>
       Henceforth the standard of appellate review where an additur or remittitur has been used in the trial court will be to ascertain whether the trial judge's actions in increasing or decreasing a verdict were justified, giving due credit to the jury's decision on the credibility of the witnesses and that of the trial judge in his capacity as thirteenth juror. Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. 1981), superseded by statute as stated in, Willoughby v. Bright, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 199 (Tenn. Ct.

       It is the exclusive province of the jury to assess damages within the range of reasonableness established by the credible proof; and trial judges are without authority to reduce or increase jury verdicts that are between the upper and lower limits of that range, but if a trial judge sitting as thirteenth juror cannot approve a jury verdict that is within the range or reasonableness established by the credible proof, he has the authority to order a new trial, but not to increase or reduce the verdict. Smith v. Shelton, 569 S.W.2d 421, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. 1978), overruled in part, Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn.

       Trial judges may suggest adjustments when the jury verdict is within the range of reasonableness, as an alternative to the practice of granting a new trial, if they are of the opinion that the jury verdict is not adequate. Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. 1981), superseded by statute as stated in, Willoughby v. Bright, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 199 (Tenn. Ct.

      </p>
      <p>
       When the trial court grants a motion for an additur, it is acting in its capacity as “thirteenth juror,” and the right to jury trial clauses of the federal and state constitutions — which require that the jury be allowed to determine all disputed issues of fact — mandate that the trial court obtain the consent of the party against whom the additur is to be entered. And if that party does not accept the additur, the trial court must order a new trial. Spence v. Allstate Ins. Co., 883 S.W.2d 586, 1994 Tenn. LEXIS 251 (Tenn. 1994).

       This section sets out no guidelines for the trial judge to follow in granting an additur. Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. 1981), superseded by statute as stated in, Willoughby v. Bright, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 199 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 1990), superseded by statute as stated in, Fergus v.

      </p>
      <p>
       A trial judge, in suggesting additur, must set a reasonable time in which defendant may accept the suggestion, to be determined at the discretion of the trial judge, but not to exceed 30 days. The 30 day limit does not preclude the trial court from enlarging the time under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 6.02. Evans v. Wilson, 776 S.W.2d 939, 1989 Tenn.

       Passion may be defined as a violent agitation of mind or a strong and deep feeling or excitement and jury verdict which is product of sympathy falls within this statute. Sutherland v. Keen, 29 Tenn. App. 303, 203 S.W.2d 917, 1947 Tenn. App. LEXIS 72 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1947).
      </p>

       Suggested remittitur by trial court was error where there was nothing to indicate that verdict was due to passion, prejudice or unaccountable caprice. Waller v. Skelton, 186 Tenn. 433, 211 S.W.2d 445, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 601 (1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that if the amount of a verdict is at variance with the decided weight of evidence, prejudice may be inferred is no way affected by this section. Board of Mayor & Aldermen v. Moore, 33 Tenn. App. 561, 232 S.W.2d 410, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 116 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The action of the trial judge in a federal court in requiring remittitur as a condition of denying a motion for a new trial is not reviewable under this section, since it would require a trial judge, sitting in a federal court, to decide on motion for new trial the question of fact whether the size of the verdict was such as to indicate passion, prejudice, or corruption, and it would also require a federal court of review to determine for itself such questions of fact, all of which is contrary to the settled practice in federal courts. The section does not apply to the personal conduct of the judge in discharge of his separate functions. Bristol Gas & Electric Co. v. Boy, 261 F. 297, 1919 U.S. App. LEXIS 1767 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of statute prior to 1949 amendment was limited to cases where judgment was so excessive as to indicate passion, prejudice, or caprice. Southern R. Co. v. Black Diamond Collieries, Inc., 9 Tenn. App. 225, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 227 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928); Yarbrough v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 11 Tenn. App. 456, 1930 Tenn.

       Trial court's suggested remittitur of a pain and suffering and mental anguish damages award to a thirty-year-old injured truck driver from $ 750,000 to $ 500,000 was not against the preponderance of the evidence because the truck driver was unable to return to work, a fact that led to both depression and anxiety, and the truck driver's physical limitations brought him a sense of shame.

       Evidence preponderated against the jury's award of $1,455,000 because there was no evidence to support any loss of earning capacity; the award was $120,353 greater than the amount calculated by the vocational analyst; thus, the jury's award for loss of earning capacity was remitted to $1,334,647.

       Evidence preponderated against the trial court's remittitur of loss of earning capacity to $1,100,000 because the vocational analyst, in view of plaintiff's low level of reading comprehension, opined that plaintiff would be able to perform only about 2% of the jobs in the labor market, that employers would be reluctant to hire someone like plaintiff who had been out of work for several years, and that there were very few occupations open to plaintiff; and the trial court's finding that plaintiff desired to work and had a strong work ethic did not overcome that testimony.

       Appellate courts customarily conduct a three-step review of a trial court's adjustment of a jury's damage award: (1) the court will examine the reasons for the trial court's action since adjustments are proper only when the court disagrees with the amount of the verdict; (2) the court will examine the amount of the suggested adjustment since adjustments that “totally destroy” the jury's verdict are impermissible; (3) the court will review the proof of damages to determine whether the evidence preponderates against the trial court's adjustment.

       Trial court did not err in only reducing a sixteen-million-dollar verdict to six million five hundred thousand dollars and, inter alia, the court had not erred in admitting testimony from a medical expert because the patient had had the burden of showing the necessity of a yearly cystoscopy examination as a preventative measure due to the increased risk of cancer in bladder augmentation patients, the testimony was elicited on cross-examination, and the jury charge rendered any prejudice which might have resulted from the doctor's testimony harmless.

       In an uninsured motor vehicle claim, the jury awarded the insured more than $10,000 over and above what evidence established to be for his medical expenses; the reason the trial court opted to suggest a remittitur of $10,135.55 was to reflect the difference between the amount the jury awarded for past medical expenses and the actual past medical expenses that were proved at trial. The remittitur did not totally destroy the jury's verdict, and the evidence supported the trial court's suggestion of remittitur. Hindman v. Doe, 241 S.W.3d 464, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 336 (Tenn. Ct.

       Court of appeals has the prerogative and duty to suggest remittitur if it deems the verdict excessive even though the trial court may have approved the verdict as rendered by the jury and expressly refused a remittitur. Methodist Hospital v. Ball, 50 Tenn. App. 460, 362 S.W.2d 475, 1961 Tenn. App. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1961).

      <p>
       If it is determined on appeal that the jury's verdict is within the range of reasonableness or that both the jury's and the trial judge's awards are within that range, the appellate court must restore the jury verdict; if only the trial judge's award is within the range, it must be affirmed; if neither are within the range of reasonableness, the court of appeals should make appropriate use of remittitur or additur and render judgment within the range of reasonableness based upon the credible proof of damages. Smith v. Shelton, 569 S.W.2d 421, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. 1978), overruled in part, Foster v. Amcon International, Inc., 621 S.W.2d 142, 1981 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       When the question of remittitur is raised, the court of appeals has the duty to review the proof of damages and the authority to reduce an excessive award. But when the trial judge has approved the verdict, the review in the court of appeals is subject to the rule that if there is any material evidence to support the award, it should not be disturbed.

       If the issue is remittitur, Smith v. Shelton, 569 S.W.2d 421, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. 1978), requires a determination of the upper limit of reasonable verdicts only. If the issue is additur Shelton requires a determination of the lower limit only. Ellis v. White Freightliner Corp., 603 S.W.2d 125, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 474 (Tenn. 1980).

      <p>
       If the analysis of the credible proof of damages results in the conclusion that the award is not excessive, there is no requirement that a figure be named beyond which the verdict would be considered excessive, but a determination has been made that the award is within the range of reasonableness.

       Although the court of appeals has the right to order remittiturs, adjust remittiturs, or accept the verdict of the jury or of the remittitur made by the trial court, it is proper for the court of appeals in most cases to approve either the verdict of the jury or the remittitur ordered by the trial court unless thoroughly satisfied that both are wrong.

      <p>
       Appellate review of a trial judge's actions in making use of remittitur or additur resolves into a determination of whether or not the jury verdict is within the range of reasonableness established by the credible proof and throughout the review, the jury's determinations should be given primary weight and the trial judge's secondary weight.

       The court has no power to amend a verdict after the jury has been discharged, except by adding a word or words so as to make the entry correspond with the court's clear impression of the finding. Berry v. Wallin, 1 Tenn. 240 (1807); Barnard v. Young, 24 Tenn. 100, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1844).

      <p>
       The privilege of the jury to decline finding any other than a general verdict is not restrained by statute, but on the contrary, the statutes seem to impliedly recognize this privilege of the jury. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

      <p>
       Right to demand finding of jury on each count separately may be waived by failure to object to the form of the verdict after it is rendered by the jury and before judgment is entered. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

      <p>
       Where mother sued for both her own damages and the damages of minor son as the result of injuries to minor she could not object because jury returned a verdict of one amount covering the damages to both where by questions asked by the jury before returning a verdict it was indicated that they would return only one sum as damages and no objection was made before judgment was entered. State ex rel. Coffelt v. Hartford Acci. & Indem. Co., 44 Tenn. App. 405, 314 S.W.2d 161, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 140 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).

       If one sues on note as bearer, where the note is not payable to bearer and is not assigned, the want of proper payee as nominal plaintiff, being a matter of form, is cured by the verdict. Wolfe v. Tyler, 48 Tenn. 313, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1870).

Cooley v. Julin, 13 Tenn. 438, 13 Tenn. 439, 1830 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1830); Rogers v. Cochran, 11 Tenn. 310, 11 Tenn. 311, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1832); Lawler v. Howard, 19 Tenn. 15, 1838 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1838); Glass v. Stovall, 29 Tenn. 453, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the appeal was made to the circuit court, there had to appear in the proceedings something showing that an appeal was prayed and granted from a justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment. Hall v. Bewley, 30 Tenn. 106, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1849); Teasdale v. Manchester Produce Co., 104 Tenn. 267, 56 S.W. 853, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       The circuit judge should allow the justice (now general sessions judge) to amend his judgment, so as to show that the appeal had been prayed for and granted, within the proper time. King v. Booker, 48 Tenn. 11, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no recital that an appeal was prayed and granted from the judgment of a justice of the peace (now general sessions judge), he was allowed to amend so as to show that the appeal was prayed and granted within the proper time; and the refusal of the circuit court to allow such amendment was error. McCarver v. Jenkins, 49 Tenn. 629, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1871); Campbell v. Illinois Cent. R.R., 84 Tenn. 270, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1886).

       Amendment by inserting given names of the plaintiffs in a justice's (now general sessions judge's) warrant after appeal to the circuit court, and even after trial and verdict, and after new trial granted. Irwin v. Sanders, 13 Tenn. 286, 13 Tenn. 287, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 165 (1833); Phillips v. Wells, 34 Tenn. 154, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1854).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a suit is commenced by a justice's (now general session judge's) warrant, and brought into the circuit court, the plaintiff may amend his warrant, by striking out his own name and inserting the name of a third person, but prosecution sureties are thereby released. Phillips v. Wells, 34 Tenn. 154, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1854); Smith v. Roby, 53 Tenn. 546, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 393 (1871); Thomas v. Cole, 57 Tenn. 411, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 224 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit by the assignee of a note, brought into the circuit court by appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace (now general sessions judge), the circuit judge may allow an amendment of the warrant, on motion of the plaintiff, the assignee of the note, so as to make the payee a nominal plaintiff for the use of the assignee, and to strike out the assignment on the note. Cannon v. Mathis, 57 Tenn. 575, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 266 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action on an official bond the suit ought to have been brought in the name of the state for the use of the plaintiff, and the court should have permitted an amendment to that effect. Smith v. Thomas, 1 Shannon 655 (1876).

      <p>
       Where appeal from justice's (now general sessions judge's) court to circuit court was defective only for want of sureties on the appeal bond, the appellants were entitled to make correction by amendment by way of new bond in circuit court, even after the appellee had taken further appeal to court of appeals. Frazier v. Biddle Auto Co., 6 Tenn. Civ. App. (6 Higgins) 489 (1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper for the circuit judge to permit a defendant who had appealed from the judgment of a justice of the peace (now general sessions judge) to the circuit court to amend his appeal bond by adding a sufficient surety. Walker v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 175 Tenn. 118, 132 S.W.2d 219, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1939).

       Justice's (now general sessions judge's) scire facias to revive a judgment could be amended in the circuit court, so as to conform to the record, and to obviate the variance between the evidence and the scire facias. Whitworth v. Thompson, 76 Tenn. 480, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1881).

       Costs are essentially statutory; and there is no constitutional restriction on the power of the legislature, and that body may provide for the taxation of costs of litigation in such manner as it may deem proper.

       In a suit on a judgment of another state, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, for the benefit of the parties entitled thereto, the costs adjudged and taxed in the suit on the original judgment if properly evidenced; and the plaintiff is entitled to recover the costs of the suit in which a new judgment is recovered. Hunt v. Lyle, 14 Tenn. 412, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1834); Gatewood v. Palmer, 29 Tenn. 466, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 16 (1850); Green-Rea Co. v. Holman, 107 Tenn. 544, 64 S.W. 889, 1901 Tenn.

      <p>
       In an action upon a judgment, the plaintiff recovering thereon is entitled to recover the costs taxed upon the original judgment, if unpaid, without interest, as costs bear no interest, and such costs of the original judgment should be taxed as costs in the second judgment; and he is also entitled to recover the costs in the second judgment to be taxed to the losing defendant. Green-Rea Co. v. Holman, 107 Tenn. 544, 64 S.W. 889, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1901).

In such case, the proper practice is to render judgment, and award execution in behalf of the defendant, for such costs as he may be thus entitled to recover. Allison v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A motion against a sheriff for an insufficient return of an execution is, in substance and legal effect, a suit or action, and therefore subject to the tax on litigation. But a motion of this character made for the first time in the supreme court as an incident to a pending appeal is held not subject to the tax on litigation, for the reason given that it is only a means of enforcing a judgment already rendered. Motion Against Curry, 59 Tenn. 51, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1873); McIntosh v. Paul, 74 Tenn. 45, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1880). See also State v. Allison, 32 Tenn. 373, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1852).
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion made to recover from a clerk, fees received by him for enrollments not made, is a suit subject to the tax on litigation. Woodward v. Alston, 59 Tenn. 581, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       This applies to criminal as well as civil cases, and county courts could assess the tax in both cases for the counties. State v. Howran, 55 Tenn. 824, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1875).
      </p>
      <p>
       Such tax is not costs in a misdemeanor case in such sense that the convict may be imprisoned for it, upon his failure to pay or secure it, though it is declared by statute a part of the costs. Ex parte Griffin, 88 Tenn. 547, 13 S.W. 75, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1890).

       A person authorized to collect tax as costs of suit is liable to the state for the tax collected by him from the successful party, if not paid under protest, unless he shows that he has not repaid it to the party, or has been sued for it by him, or notified by him not to pay it over.

       In a criminal case, a surety on a prosecution or appeal bond, against whom, with his principal as the unsuccessful party, the costs of the cause are adjudged, is not liable for the tax on litigation. State Tax Cases, 80 Tenn. 744, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1884); Johnson v. State, 85 Tenn. 325, 2 S.W. 802, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1886).

       Where the county leases the workhouse prisoners to others, and derives a revenue from their labor, it is liable for the state tax in such cases. State v. Sibley, 72 Tenn. 738, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1880); State v. Davidson County, 96 Tenn. 178, 33 S.W. 924, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1896).

      <p>
       A county is not liable to the state where the misdemeanant, upon payment of the fine and costs to the clerk of the circuit or criminal court, is discharged without payment of the state tax on litigation, and such clerk has paid the fine into the county treasury, for the county cannot be held responsible for the state tax upon the ground that it has received the fine to which it was entitled. State v. Davidson County, 96 Tenn. 178, 33 S.W. 924, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1896).

       Under Acts 1919, ch. 134, which required litigation taxes to be included in the bill of costs, and which prohibited their remission, a misdemeanant cannot be required to work out state and county litigation taxes, but a motion to strike them from the bill of costs may properly be overruled, the remedies being by habeas corpus, if any effort to require him to work out such items should be made.

       This section does not apply to appeals, so as to authorize the appellant to dismiss his appeal before the clerk of the court below, after the perfection of his appeal, and the adjournment of the court appealed from, and his entry of dismissal in the lower court at such time is a nullity.

       A written dismissal of a suit in vacation puts an end to the suit, and terminates the control of the court over it, as fully as if made in term time, and the power and jurisdiction of the court over the cause ceases, except to render judgment for costs, or to make such orders as may be indispensable to give effect to the dismissal.

       The fact that if dismissal of a suit to invalidate a tax title to certain real estate is allowed “without prejudice” other suits may be brought, thereby causing a cloud on the title to the property in question, is not a sufficient reason to prevent the court in its discretion allowing a voluntary dismissal.

       Tax on litigation is not avoided by such dismissal upon compromise before the return day of the writ, because such tax accrues when the suit is commenced; and where the defendant agrees to pay the costs, he is the unsuccessful party, and liable for the tax.

       To enable the appellate court to correct the taxation of costs in the court below, the motion for such correction or retaxation must first be made in the lower court, its action had thereon, and the motion and judgment entered of record; and the taxation of costs by the inferior court for the attendance of witnesses therein cannot be corrected by the appellate court, without such motion and judgment of record.

Williams's Lessee v. Henderson, 1 Tenn. 424, 1809 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1809); State v. Richards, 120 Tenn. 477, 113 S.W. 370, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1908).

       An original bill will not lie in the chancery court for the correction of the taxation of costs, as to items wrongfully charged or taxed in the bill of costs by the clerk and master. The remedy is by petition to the chancellor for retaxation of the costs and supersedeas in the meantime as to the erroneous items. Clark v. Stull, 1 Shan. 660 (1876); State v.

      </p>
      <p>
       A rule to correct the taxation of costs is a mere collateral motion, and does not operate, per se, as a supersedeas, and, if not acted on, it will be considered as abandoned. Miller v. Netherland, 31 Tenn. 66, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1851).

       Retaxation of costs, so as to embrace omitted fees, will not be allowed unless it shall be made to appear that the services for which the fees are claimed were performed. The statements of the petition for retaxation, and the recitals of the order made thereon setting out the items, do not, without more, afford evidence to justify retaxation. Johnson v.

       Retaxation of costs striking out the item of costs for the attendance of an incompetent witness of the successful party, which has been paid, does not entitle the unsuccessful party to recover it from such witness, for his right of action, if the correction be legally made, is against the successful party. This is based upon the rule that an incompetent witness is entitled to compensation for his attendance, if he be examined. Gray v. Alexander, 26 Tenn. 16, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1846).

       In action against individual and corporation, in which corporation's plea in abatement was sustained and plaintiff's motion for new trial was overruled, and in which plaintiff perfected an appeal and thereafter entered voluntary nonsuit as to individual defendant, corporate defendant's motion to dismiss appeal was properly sustained on ground that appeal was prematurely prayed, granted and perfected.

       Where plaintiff perfected an appeal from judgment sustaining plea in abatement filed by corporate defendant and thereafter took voluntary nonsuit as to individual defendant in same action, whereupon corporate defendant moved to dismiss appeal and plaintiff then filed petition for writ of error, nonsuit was properly granted because there had been no valid appeal at time it was taken and judgment on plea in abatement was therefore a final judgment subject to review either by appeal in error or petition for writ of error.

Welsh v. Marshall, 14 Tenn. 455, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1834); Cartmell v. McClaren, 59 Tenn. 41, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1873); Jacobs v. Parker, 66 Tenn. 434, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 161 (1874); Jackson v.

LEXIS 19 (1890); Frazier v. Nashville Gas & Heating Co., 164 Tenn. 8, 46 S.W.2d 62, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1932). But see State v. Logston, 50 Tenn. 276, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1871), not citing the Code and holding that, where a change of venue is illegally ordered, and the court to which the change is ordered has, in consequence, no jurisdiction, it can render no judgment for the costs of a trial which has taken place there, nor can the court of the county from which the cause came; and neither court has any power of retaxation of the costs.

       The entire costs of the litigation in which usury is discovered shall not be paid by the party receiving or reserving it, but only the costs incident to the litigation over the question of usury.

       The complainant in a cross bill to enforce a deed of trust securing a note, a sale under which was enjoined, is properly charged with all costs, except that of the sale, where his unfounded claim to retain all usurious payments made more than six years before the commencement of the suit, without applying them to the principal, was the cause of the litigation.

       This statute is given effect in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-101" target="_self">20-12-101</a></cite>. Woolfolk v. Woolfolk, 167 Tenn. 362, 69 S.W.2d 1089, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1934).

       It was not the legislative intent to curb the discretion afforded the trial court in awarding fees and costs under the provisions of this section and Tenn. R. Civ. P. 17.03 and 54.04 by the subsequent enactment of § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.34.html#t34c12s34-12-117" target="_blank">34-12-117</a></cite>. In re Webb, 675 S.W.2d 176, 1984 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       “Proceedings” means all acts and events that occur as a result of the dismissed claim(s) from the date the dismissed claim(s) is filed; thus, when a trial court grants a motion to dismiss, the statute requires the trial court to award the party or parties against whom the dismissed claims were pending at the time the motion to dismiss was granted the costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the party due to the dismissed claims from the date those claims were filed. Donovan v. Hastings, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 483 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 30, 2020).

A trial court's order can be final despite the outstanding issue of recoverable attorney's fees when those fees are awarded by virtue of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-119ol1c" target="_self">20-12-119(c)</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a conservatorship action in which an attorney ad litem was appointed to represent respondent, the trial court did not have discretion to charge any portion of the attorney ad litem's fees to any party but respondent because, although T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-119" target="_self">20-12-119</a></cite> applied to all civil cases, it was a general statutory provision that was superseded by the specific statutory provision in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.34.html#t34c01s34-1-125ol1b" target="_blank">34-1-125(b)</a></cite> mandating that the costs of the attorney ad litem were to be assessed against respondent.

       A trial judge has broad discretion in the adjudication of costs, according to his view of the equities of the case. His action is reviewable only for manifest abuse. Lewis v. Koehn, 5 Tenn. App. 530, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 88 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927); Conatser v. Reagan, 7 Tenn. App. 450, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 64 (1928).
      </p>

       Costs of court are a discretionary matter for the court that tries the case to determine. Erin v. Brooks, 190 Tenn. 407, 230 S.W.2d 397, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 500 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In ejectment proceedings wherein purchasers of land at bankrupt sale sought to establish fee simple interest in such land but failed, court in its discretion could tax fee of guardian ad litem who represented minor children of bankrupt as part of costs assessed against such purchasers under decree holding that such children had a contingent interest in the property. Butler v. Parker, 200 Tenn. 603, 293 S.W.2d 174, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 445 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where certiorari was brought to review action of city clerk in refusing to certify recall petition to election commissioners and thereafter party whose recall was sought intervened in proceedings it was within the power of the trial judge to adjudge the costs primarily against the intervening petitioner and secondarily against the defendant. Roberts v. Brown, 43 Tenn. App. 567, 310 S.W.2d 197, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 137 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

       Where insurer conceded liability as insurer to such persons which court should determine were beneficiaries and court finally concluded following appeal that beneficiaries were widow of valid first marriage, legitimate child of first marriage, illegitimate child of widow of void second marriage, and child born of void second marriage following death of employee it was equitable that two thirds of the costs should be charged against benefits allowed children of second wife, and one third of the costs charged to first wife and her child.

       In a condemnation proceeding the property owners were properly adjudged to stand the cost of appeal, where the city, which was condemning the property for public use, presenting its appeal in the trial court in proper form, was erroneously denied the right to present rebuttal evidence as to the value of the property on trial de novo, and the case was reversed and remanded for a new trial by the supreme court.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the judge has reason to believe that the proponent of a codicil was guilty of fraud and undue influence in the execution of the codicil, it is not an abuse of discretion to assess costs against the proponent. Hager v. Hager, 17 Tenn. App. 143, 66 S.W.2d 250, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Costs of will contest could be assessed against estate even though contest failed where testator had committed suicide within two months after execution of will and where contest could conceivably result in some advantage to executors and trustees particularly in administration of trust which would not terminate for 15 years. Curry v. Bridges, 45 Tenn. App. 395, 325 S.W.2d 87, 1959 Tenn. App. LEXIS 77 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal in will contest where plaintiff-in-error rendered service to the estate by obtaining evidence from which jury could more intelligently reach a decision as to the true last will and testament of decedent, costs would be divided between plaintiff-in-error and defendant-in-error even though decision of lower court was affirmed. Donnelly v. Hendrix, 49 Tenn. App. 361, 355 S.W.2d 116, 1960 Tenn. App. LEXIS 136 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1960).

       Where the language of the will reasonably required litigation for the mutual benefit of all beneficiaries, it was proper to apportion cost among all those party to the action. Harris v. Bittikofer, 562 S.W.2d 815, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 593 (Tenn. 1978).

       Where plaintiffs brought a successful action for a declaratory judgment granting them the authority to order that a comatose patient be removed from a life-sustaining respirator, and where patient's physician was joined as a necessary defendant, the court held that the equities of the case required that all costs, including the guardian ad litem's fee, be paid by the plaintiffs who initiated the action, rather than by the physician.

       Compensation for legal services rendered by solicitors and guardians ad litem must not be out of proportion to the value of the property involved in the litigation and it is intolerable to allow the property that is subject to litigation to be devoured by fees.

       Mother and minor child were seeking to dismiss the father's petition for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, in the case of the appeal in the nature of a writ of error, and for lack of personal jurisdiction, in the case of the petition to enroll a foreign judgment; they were not seeking to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and thus the statute was not an appropriate basis for awarding attorney fees.

       Appellant did not delineate for the trial court the amount of fees incurred for the hearing on the motion to dismiss and thus failed to meet her burden of proof; the trial court declined to value those fees absent the requisite proof, which was within its discretion to do, and no abuse of discretion was found.

       Statute requires that there be an unappealable final decision before a trial court can award attorney fees pursuant to the statute; in this case, the May 24, 2019 order resolved all claims and neither party appealed or filed a post-judgment motion. Thus, the order became final and unappealable on June 23, 2019, and because an award of fees was stayed until that time, appellant's motion for fees filed two weeks later was not too late to entitle her to an award of fees under the statute. Donovan v. Hastings, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 483 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 30, 2020).

      <p>
       Amended countercomplaint was the latest countercomplaint in which the breach of contract claim was made and appellant filed her motion to dismiss the amended countercomplaint within 60 days of the time she was served, and thus the exception set forth in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-119ol1c5B" target="_self">20-12-119(c)(5)(B)</a></cite> regarding attorney fees did not apply.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court dismissed the breach of contract claim in the amended countercomplaint, appellant was entitled to an award of attorney fees she incurred as a result of the breach of contract claim from the date the amended countercomplaint was filed, and the trial court properly excluded the requested attorney fees that were incurred prior to that date.

      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding duplicate fees; the court concluded that duplicate time entries for two attorneys to perform the same work on the motion to dismiss were to be excluded because they were unnecessary and unreasonable in light of the single, narrow legal issue presented and the relative dollar amount at issue on the dismissed breach of contract claim.

       Where complainant was the successful party, obtaining decree against defendant for costs, and upon issuance of execution against defendant it was returned nulla bona, the surety on prosecution bond is not liable on motion by clerk and master in an equity case for costs accrued at complainant's instance. The terms of the bond are met, as to surety, when the court decreed in favor of complainant and awarded no costs against complainant. Woolfolk v. Woolfolk, 167 Tenn. 362, 69 S.W.2d 1089, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute was always construed to mean that the surety was not liable for costs beyond the judgment of the court in which the suit was instituted. And therefore if the suit was successfully prosecuted to judgment in that court the liability of the surety ceased. So strictly was the liability of the surety construed, that if the suit was eventually prosecuted with success, the surety was not liable for the costs of a nonsuit suffered by his principal in the progress of the cause. Coker v. Armco Drainage & Metal Products Co., 192 Tenn. 10, 236 S.W.2d 980, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 375 (1951).

       Prosecution bond is good without stating the nature of the action, where otherwise in proper form and properly conditioned. Broyles v. Blair, 15 Tenn. 278, 15 Tenn. 279, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1834); Chanie v. Bull, 16 Tenn. 219, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1835).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognizance or cost bond is good without naming the payee, if the parties to the suit are named, and the surety agrees to the defendant's security for costs, for this certainly means that the bond or recognizance is security for the adverse party. Parks v. Allen, 39 Tenn. 523, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 267 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       A recognizance not binding to “prosecute the suit with effect,” nor in terms made payable “to the opposite party,” is good, for these omissions may be supplied by intendment of law. Kincaid v. Sharp, 40 Tenn. 151, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       Omissions of penalty do not invalidate the recognizance, where the undertaking of the surety is that his principal shall pay and satisfy whatever judgment the court may render in the case, for this is a substantial compliance with the law. Kincaid v. Sharp, 40 Tenn. 151, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1859).

       Recognizance in larger penalty than that prescribed by law is not thereby invalidated, as a bond for a larger sum than that required in a will contest is valid. Parks v. Allen, 39 Tenn. 523, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 267 (1859).

      <p>
       A recognizance acknowledged in open court, and entered of record, may well be substituted for a prosecution bond, for an undertaking by recognizance for costs is as good and binding as if by bond, because a recognizance is an obligation of record, entered into before the court, and is, for all practical purposes, of equal validity and effect as a formal bond. Parks v. Allen, 39 Tenn. 523, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 267 (1859); Kincaid v. Sharp, 40 Tenn. 151, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1859).

      <p>
       After the plaintiff has once, under a rule, given bond with six sureties, it is error to make a second rule upon the plaintiff to justify or give other security, upon the ground merely that two of the former sureties were insolvent, when from the silence of the affidavit, it was impliedly conceded that the remaining four sureties were solvent and sufficient. Irvins v. Mathis, 30 Tenn. 603, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 166 (1850).

      <p>
       After the circuit judge has once required the plaintiff to increase the penalty of his bond and to give new sureties, and has accepted such bond with such sureties, the judge cannot be required to entertain another motion for a rule of the plaintiff to again increase the penalty of the bond and to give additional sureties, upon affidavit stating no new facts or changed circumstances.

      In all cases of bonds, for the prosecution of original suits, or where security is taken or recorded in any court, sufficient security shall be taken by the clerk to pay all costs that may be at any time adjudged against the principal, in the event they are not paid by the principal. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, where an attorney undertakes to serve as surety after July 1, 1999, such surety shall only be obligated for amounts required by law or included in the clerk's bill of costs, and shall not be responsible for discretionary costs. In such instances, the clerk may require an additional surety other than the attorney as may be necessary to secure payment for discretionary costs.

       Plaintiff's successful prosecution of his suit at law to judgment discharges the undertaking of the surety on his prosecution bond. Carren v. Breed, 42 Tenn. 465, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1865); Dawson v. Holt, 80 Tenn. 27, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1883), overruling Clerk's Motions for Judgments for Costs, 59 Tenn. 152, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever, in the progress of the particular cause, costs are adjudged against the principal, the judgment shall also be against the surety. But the statute does not amend § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-137" target="_self">20-12-137</a></cite>, which contemplates a new proceeding, and, therefore, does not make the surety of the successful party liable for the costs of his principal. Deaton v. Mulvaney, 69 Tenn. 73, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1878); Dawson v. Holt, 80 Tenn. 27, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       The surety on the prosecution bond of a plaintiff successful in the circuit court is not liable for costs of appeal, upon reversal of the case by the supreme court, but he is liable for the costs of the circuit court, for which the supreme court may render judgment. Dawson v. Holt, 80 Tenn. 27, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 135 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       A surety on the prosecution bond engages only to pay costs adjudged against the complainant. He does not engage to pay complainant's costs adjudged against the defendant which those entitled to costs cannot make out the defendant. Woolfolk v. Woolfolk, 167 Tenn. 362, 69 S.W.2d 1089, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where after appeal to circuit court from general sessions court on pauper's oath, defendant brought action by cross summons and filed cost bond for successful prosecution of the action, surety was not liable on cost bond for amount of judgment rendered against defendant in original action. McCalla v. Nelson, 44 Tenn. App. 164, 313 S.W.2d 462, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 172 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the rule of stricti juri prevents the court from extending the liability of a surety beyond any express limitations in his obligation, the rule should not be used to refine away plain terms. Major v. General Motors Corp., 742 F. Supp. 1355, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11062 (M.D. Tenn. 1990).

       The costs in chancery may be adjudged against the successful party and his surety, in the sound discretion of the chancellor, and the surety for costs undertakes with reference to this discretionary power of the chancellor and subject to its exercise. Glaze v. Eason & Blair, 10 Tenn. 301, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1829); Wray v. Williams, 10 Tenn. 302, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1829); Allison v. Stephens, 39 Tenn. 251, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 288 (Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecution surety in a chancery suit may be held liable, upon appeal, for all the costs of the cause, although the case was successfully prosecuted to decree in favor of complainant in the chancery and supreme courts, and although the liability of the surety was expressly limited by the bond to the costs of the chancery court, for, the law in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-126" target="_self">20-12-126</a></cite> is a part of the contract in the bond for costs.

       The surety for costs on the original bill is liable to the extent of the penalty of his bond for costs which accrue on an amended bill filed in the same cause, and such surety is not released by the fact that the court, upon motion, ordered the complainant to execute a new bond with other sureties, which he failed to do, and he afterward took the pauper oath. Lovelace v. Smith, 67 Tenn. 263, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 368 (1874).

       Attorney having recovered a fee on creditor's suit against defendants, sought judgment therefor on appeal against surety on appeal bond which covered only debt, interest, and costs involved in the appeal; court was without authority to render such judgment. Hyder v. Hyder, 16 Tenn. App. 64, 66 S.W.2d 235, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 39 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

      <p>
       Where the liability of the surety on an appeal bond is not fixed prior to the discharge in bankruptcy of the principal, and on appeal the claim against the principal is heard de novo, if a discharge in bankruptcy operates as a bar to the rendering of a judgment against him on the appeal, such surety is released. Nance v. Gatlin & Cannon, 2 Tenn. App. 73, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 95 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).
      </p>

       Where the principal had not received a discharge in bankruptcy, the rendition of judgment against the surety should be stayed pending final step in bankruptcy. Nance v. Gatlin & Cannon, 2 Tenn. App. 73, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 95 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).

       A surety on an appeal bond for damages and costs, given, as required by law, upon an appeal to the supreme court, is only liable for the costs incident to the appeal, and not for the costs of the court below. Denton v. Woods' Adm'r, 79 Tenn. 505, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1883).
      </p>
      <p>
       As between the surety on a certiorari bond to bring a justice's (now general sessions judge's) judgment into the circuit court, and the surety of appeal from the circuit to the supreme court, the latter was primarily liable. Moore v. Lassiter, 84 Tenn. 630, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 150 (1886). See Kinzer v. Helm, 54 Tenn. 672, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 103 (1872); Love v. Allison, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 111 (1874); Murray v.

       Acts limiting the right to sue upon the pauper's oath to citizens or residents of this state are not unconstitutional for that reason. Kincaid v. Francis, 3 Tenn. 49 (1812). See Blake v. McClung, <cite class="us_code">172 U.S. 239</cite>, <cite class="s_court">19 S. Ct. 165</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">43 L. Ed. 432</cite>, 1898 U.S. LEXIS 1651 (1898); Campbell v. Lee, 12 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Only a resident of this state may prosecute a suit or an appeal upon the pauper's oath and the chancellor is without power to grant to a nonresident the right to appeal on a pauper's oath. Hamby v. Northcut, 25 Tenn. App. 11, 149 S.W.2d 484, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 87 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       A pauper's oath filed by a nonresident is a nullity, and an attempted appeal thereon is not perfected. After the expiration of the thirty days, the cause, in so far as the nonresident is concerned, stands in the same plight and condition as if no appeal by the nonresident had been prayed or granted. Hamby v. Northcut, 25 Tenn. App. 11, 149 S.W.2d 484, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 87 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).

       In view of its purposes, to provide benefits to minor children living in a state foreign to the residence of their father who refuses to support them, provisions of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act permitting filing of a petition by a nonresident upon a pauper's oath, certified in accordance with the law of a certifying state, although the general laws do not authorize such filing, do not violate our constitutional prohibition against suspension of our general laws. Martin v. Martin, 213 Tenn. 345, 373 S.W.2d 609, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 488 (1963).

       Because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c12s20-12-127" target="_self">20-12-127</a></cite> was inapplicable to judicial review of administrative proceedings and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.50.html#t50c07s50-7-304ol1i" target="_blank">50-7-304(i)</a></cite> did not limit the availability of judicial review in forma pauperis to Tennessee residents, the statute conferred upon an indigent claimant, regardless of claimant's Arkansas residency, the right to seek judicial review in forma pauperis of an administrative decision denying unemployment compensation benefits where the claimant worked in Tennessee and was discharged in Tennessee. Patterson v. Tenn. Dep't of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev., 60 S.W.3d 60, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 781 (Tenn. 2001).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The object of this statute is to enable any poor person to prosecute an action without giving a cost bond (save in the cases excepted), and the right extends to appeals, appeals in error, and writs of error, which are in the nature of actions and within the purview of the statute; and the purpose is to place the weak on a level with the strong in a contest for their rights in the courts. Scott v. Brandon, 125 Tenn. 314, 143 S.W. 601, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law is very liberal in allowing the prosecution of suits in forma pauperis. The object of this rule is to place the weak on a level with the strong, in a contest for their rights in a court of justice. Hewell v. Cherry, 25 Tenn. App. 420, 158 S.W.2d 370, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 125 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section extends the right to proceed on the pauper's oath to appeals, appeals in error, and writs of error, and writs of certiorari and supersedeas in lieu of an appeal, and upon a proper showing a supersedeas or an attachment may be had on the pauper's oath. Hewell v. Cherry, 25 Tenn. App. 420, 158 S.W.2d 370, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 125 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section is to place poor persons on a level with the wealthy in a contest for their rights in the courts and it should be construed as remedial legislation and given a liberal construction to effectuate its purpose. King v. Leeman, 30 Tenn. App. 206, 204 S.W.2d 384, 1946 Tenn. App. LEXIS 111 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1946).

       In light of the liberal policy of allowing indigent parties to proceed in court without first providing a cost bond, an indigent defendant in an unlawful detainer action who has petitioned for writs of certiorari and supersedeas is required to post a possessory bond, but the bond does not have to include the costs of the action; in other words, the bond posted by the indigent defendant must be sufficient in amount to cover damages and the value of the rent of the premises during the litigation.

       Plaintiff in a slander case cannot, upon the pauper's oath, prosecute an appeal from a judgment dismissing his suit and taxing him with the costs. Cox v. Patton, 79 Tenn. 545, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1883); Hendrickson v. Cartright, 99 Tenn. 364, 41 S.W. 1053, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1897). But see Heatherly v. Bridges, 48 Tenn. 220, 1870 Tenn.

       A rule of a federal district court to the effect that where suits are instituted in forma pauperis, and counsel for plaintiff is an interested party by reason of having taken the case on a contingent fee, depending upon the result of the action, such suit cannot be prosecuted upon plaintiff's oath of his own poverty alone, but that counsel must likewise execute and file such an oath or give proper security for costs, is not invalid.

       The statute does not, by its language, prohibit a corporation from filing a pauper's oath. V. L. Nicholson Co. v. Transcon Inv. & Financial, Ltd., 595 S.W.2d 474, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 406 (Tenn. 1980), superseded by statute as stated in, Barnett v. Willis, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 420 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 13, 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no challenge to the actual wording of the pauper's oath, it was legally sufficient; however, better practice requires that when a corporation files a pauper's oath it state as specifically as possible its reasons for its inability to bear the costs of the action. V. L. Nicholson Co. v. Transcon Inv. & Financial, Ltd., 595 S.W.2d 474, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 406 (Tenn. 1980), superseded by statute as stated in, Barnett v. Willis, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       While the words “any resident” might be construed as contemplating a natural person, there is no reason to construe the words as excluding a corporation which is a resident of the state; the better practice would be to extend to an insolvent corporation this opportunity to pursue a meritorious appeal. V. L. Nicholson Co. v. Transcon Inv. & Financial, Ltd., 595 S.W.2d 474, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 406 (Tenn. 1980), superseded by statute as stated in, Barnett v. Willis, — S.W.2d —, 1990 Tenn.

       It is entirely possible in those cases where the statute requires bond for the full amount of the judgment, that the corporate entity, while unable to procure bond for the entire amount, may partially bond the judgment, resulting in an appeal bond, in part, and resting on the pauper's oath in part; this type of situation should be resolved in the trial court.

       It is impossible to lay down a rule which will govern in every case in determining whether a party should be dispaupered or not. Much must be left to the sound discretion of the judge who tries the question, but on such trials the uniform language of the supreme court has been that the laws passed to enable poor persons to litigate their rights in court should be construed and administered with great liberality. Heatherly v. Hill, 67 Tenn. 170, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 346 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal on the pauper's oath, where the falsity of the oath of poverty is conclusively shown, the trial court is required to dismiss the appeal since the court in such case could not by arbitrary exercise of discretion decline to do that which the proof showed ought to be done, but was required to decide the question in the same manner as any other question coming before it for decision, subject to a review of its decision by the appellate court. Fort v. Noe, 144 Tenn. 337, 233 S.W. 516, 1920 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1920).

       On defendant's appeal to the circuit court on the pauper's oath, uncontradicted proof by disinterested witnesses that the defendant had property worth more than $5,000 conclusively establishes the falsity of his affidavit of poverty.

      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal to the circuit court from a justice of the peace (now general sessions court), upon the pauper's oath, the oath itself could not be considered as evidence on the question of the truth or falsity of the affidavit of poverty.

       Where defendant sought to defend suit contesting a will under pauper oath and where there was no testimony by disinterested persons that the allegation of poverty was probably untrue defendant was entitled to proceed with the suit in forma pauperis and it was not within the discretion of the trial court to order such defendant to execute a contest bond.

       Testimony of fellow employee and payroll administrator of plaintiff's employer, as well as plaintiff's own admissions, satisfied defendant's burden of demonstrating that plaintiff's oath of poverty was probably untrue.

       Where suit to recover money allegedly misappropriated from two Tennessee children's home societies was apparently authorized by the state through the attorney general, and the societies did not authorize the bringing of the suit, which was dismissed because the district attorney general was not made a party complainant, the costs could not be legally assessed against the societies but should be adjudged against the state.

       The costs of a suit belong exclusively to the witnesses, officers of the court, and the other persons in whose favor they are taxed, and may, when collected, be paid by the sheriff to them. Smith v. Van Bebber, 31 Tenn. 110, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1851); Carey v. Campbell, 35 Tenn. 62, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1855).

       If the clerk of a court improperly pays to the party to the suit, nominally recovering the costs of suit, the costs taxed in favor of other persons, such persons may, by motion, recover the same from the clerk. Carey v. Campbell, 35 Tenn. 62, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1855).

      <p>
       The party recovering costs is entitled to have the costs collected applied first to the payment of costs accrued at his instance and for which he would be liable if not collected from the opposite party; as, where the defendant recovers judgment for costs against the plaintiff and his prosecution surety to the extent of the prosecution bond, which is insufficient to cover the entire costs, and the penalty of the bond only is collected from the surety, such defendant is entitled to have such costs as accrued at his instance and for which he would be liable if not collected from the plaintiff, paid first, with the qualification as to the order of the payment. The surety for cost cannot satisfy the judgment against himself for the penalty of his bond, by paying the amount to those entitled to costs from his principal (the unsuccessful plaintiff), but the law applies it to the costs incurred by the defendant. Locke v. McFalls, 35 Tenn. 674, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1856); Deaton v. Mulvaney, 69 Tenn. 73, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1878).

       Where only a part of the costs is paid, the clerk must pay in full as far as the amount will go, in the order following: (1) The state tax on litigation. State v. Stanley, 71 Tenn. 524, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1879); State Tax Cases, 80 Tenn. 744, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1884); Ex parte Griffin, 88 Tenn. 547, 13 S.W. 75, 1889 Tenn.

       A suit against the state of Tennessee is barred by Tenn. Const. art. I, § 17 when it is not brought in such manner as the legislature has directed in this section. Chumbley v. State, 183 Tenn. 467, 192 S.W.2d 1007, 1946 Tenn. LEXIS 226 (1946).
      </p>

       A suit against a state official in that person's official capacity is a suit against the state, and therefore, must be brought in compliance with Tenn. Const. art. I, § 17. Whitaker v. Whirlpool Corp., 32 S.W.3d 222, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 171 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).

       The rule of sovereign immunity in Tennessee is both constitutional and statutory; it is not within the power of the courts to amend it. Jones v. L & N R. Co., 617 S.W.2d 164, 1981 Tenn. App. LEXIS 497 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981).

       General assembly has chosen not to waive sovereign immunity under the circumstances where a state college or university professor seeks back pay or other monetary relief for wrongful dismissal; moreover, any abrogation of the immunity doctrine by the legislature must be set out in plain, clear, and unmistakable terms. Wells v. Tenn. Bd. of Regents, 231 S.W.3d 912, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 647 (Tenn. Aug. 17, 2007), cert. denied, <cite class="l_ed">169 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 732, <cite class="s_court">128 S.

       By the statute all jurisdiction to entertain suits against the state, without limitation or qualification, is taken from the courts. Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co. v. State, 3 Shan. 529 (1875); Walters v. State, 2 Shan. 69 (1876); Collier v. Goessling, 160 F. 604, 1908 U.S. App. LEXIS 4227 (6th Cir. 1908), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">215 U.S. 596</cite>, <cite class="s_court">30 S. Ct. 399</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">54 L. Ed. 342</cite>, 1909 U.S. LEXIS 1979 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principle is elementary that a state cannot be sued in its own courts without its consent. Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, <cite class="us_code">101 U.S. 337</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">25 L. Ed. 960</cite>, 1879 U.S. LEXIS 1923 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       The express declaration of the Constitution that “suits may be brought against the state in such manner and in such courts as the legislature may by law direct,” carries with it a positive implication that they shall not be brought otherwise, or at all, unless legislative authority therefor be affirmatively given. North British & Mercantile Co. v. Craig, 106 Tenn. 621, 62 S.W. 155, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 197 (1901); Quinton v. Board of Claims, 165 Tenn. 201, 54 S.W.2d 953, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state may not be sued unless the words of the statute are so unmistakable as to leave no doubt of legislative intent that the state may be subjected to litigation. Phillips v. Marion County, 166 Tenn. 83, 59 S.W.2d 507, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1933); Sweeney v. State Dep't of Transp., 744 S.W.2d 905, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2853 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).

       Dismissal of a claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4334, was proper because, for an individual to sustain an action against a state pursuant to USERRA, the action must have been permitted by state law, and the Tennessee general assembly had not passed legislation to expressly waive its sovereign immunity from claims based on USERRA; appellant's claim that the state of Tennessee had impliedly waived its immunity from USERRA claims by expressly waiving its immunity from claims under the Tennessee Human Rights Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.04.html#t04c21s4-21-101" target="_blank">4-21-101</a></cite> et seq., and the Tennessee Disability Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c50s8-50-103ol1a" target="_blank">8-50-103(a)</a></cite>, was misplaced because any such waiver had to be made in plain, clear, and unmistakable terms. The Tennessee National Guard was a division of the Tennessee Military Department, and thus was an entity of the state of Tennessee, and accordingly, the Tennessee National Guard had immunity from claims arising under the USERRA.

     <p>
      The attorney general and reporter may compromise and settle, insofar as the state is concerned, any civil litigation to which the state may be a party, upon such terms as in the attorney general and reporter's opinion may seem to be in the best interest of the state, and may enter into such agreements in connection with the compromise and settlement as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. Written approval of the comptroller of the treasury and governor shall be required for any compromise and settlement greater than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). The attorney general and reporter shall submit a report quarterly to the comptroller of the treasury and governor of all compromises and settlements made without the written approval of the comptroller of the treasury and governor. The written approval of the speaker of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives, the comptroller of the treasury and governor, shall be also required for the compromise and settlement of such civil litigation to which the state may be a party if the compromise and settlement will result in a significant increase in state expenditures, affect the bond rating of the state or result in a decision on a policy issue that may result in a significant increase in state expenditures.

      Within ten (10) days of the filing of the petition under this chapter or as soon as practical thereafter, but in no case later than thirty (30) days after the filing of the petition, a hearing shall be held on the petition for the injunction. In the event a hearing cannot be scheduled within the county where the case is pending within the thirty-day period, it shall be scheduled and heard as soon as possible. The respondent may file a response that explains, excuses, justifies, or denies the alleged unlawful violence or credible threat of violence or may file a cross-complaint under this chapter. At the hearing, the judge shall receive any testimony that is relevant and may make an independent inquiry. If the judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent engaged in unlawful violence or made a credible threat of violence, an injunction shall be issued prohibiting further unlawful violence or threats of violence at the workplace or while the employee or employer is acting within the course and scope of employment. An injunction issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a duration of not more than three (3) years. At any time within the three-month period before the expiration of the injunction, the petitioner may apply for a renewal of the injunction by filing a new petition for an injunction pursuant to this chapter.

      Workers' Compensation Appeals Board Decisions. An employee alleged various injuries caused by a fall at work. After some discovery was conducted, the employer filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging the employee's evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish a compensable injury. After requesting and receiving additional time to respond to the motion, the employee's counsel filed a motion to withdraw. The trial court scheduled a hearing on both motions, requiring the employee's counsel to present his client's argument in response to the motion for summary judgment prior to its entertaining the motion to withdraw. During his argument, the employee's counsel acknowledged he had no expert medical evidence to submit in opposition to the employer's motion for summary judgment. Following the hearing, the trial court granted the motion to withdraw but denied the motion for summary judgment. The employer has appealed. Upon careful consideration of the record, the trial court's order denying the motion for summary judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of an order granting the motion. King v. Kasai North America, Inc., 2019 TN Wrk Comp App Bd LEXIS 16.
