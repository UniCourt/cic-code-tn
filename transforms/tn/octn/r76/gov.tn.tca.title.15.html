      Compiler's Notes. Acts 1984, ch. 979, §§ 2, 3 provided that the governor choose one or more of the present legal holidays established in this section which shall be deleted upon their designation by the governor, the intent of the 1984 amendment being that the chief executive could select two days in any one year to apply for a two-year period where overall there would be no more than one set aside over a two-year period. The governor chose the election day holiday for the August and November elections.

      <p>
       A judgment is not void because rendered on a legal holiday, since the statute permits but does not require the observance of the legal holidays; and it is not mandatory that those days shall be observed, but it is optional with the parties in interest, or managing the public offices or business, to observe the same; and the option is with the courts, and not with the litigants. Elrod v. Gray Lumber Co., 92 Tenn. 476, 22 S.W. 2, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of the word “may” in this section indicates that it was the purpose to make holidays optional with public officials in closing the offices, and that it may or may not be treated as a day of business. Hammick v. Gilbert, 24 Tenn. App. 330, 144 S.W.2d 5, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the day for doing an act required by statute falls on a legal holiday when a public office is closed, the performance of the act the next succeeding business day meets the requirement of the statute. Arp v. Wolfe, 49 Tenn. App. 294, 354 S.W.2d 799, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 174 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

      <p>
       A legal holiday under this section has a different status from that of Sunday. Hammick v. Gilbert, 24 Tenn. App. 330, 144 S.W.2d 5, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Fact that this section declares Saturdays to be half-holidays on which public offices may be closed did not require that Saturdays be counted as half days in computing the 10-day period provided by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.27.html#t27c05s27-5-108" target="_blank">27-5-108</a></cite> for appeals from decisions of general sessions courts. Biggs v. Memphis Loan &amp; Thrift Co., 215 Tenn. 294, 385 S.W.2d 118, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 566 (1964).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While the performance of some acts is excused upon a holiday, such as the presentment of a note, which may be performed the following day, the foreclosure of a mortgage or trust deed is not prohibited or excused because the date of foreclosure falls upon a legal holiday. Hammick v. Gilbert, 24 Tenn. App. 330, 144 S.W.2d 5, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 38 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).

      <p>
       It is a matter of common knowledge of which the courts will take judicial notice that all public buildings and public offices are generally closed on Labor Day. Arp v. Wolfe, 49 Tenn. App. 294, 354 S.W.2d 799, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 174 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
