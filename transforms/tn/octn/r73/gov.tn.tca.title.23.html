      Amendments. The 2013 amendment substituted “the civil justice and finance, ways and means committees of the house of representatives and the judiciary and finance, ways and means committees of the senate” for “the judiciary committees and the finance, ways and means committees of the senate and the house of representatives” in the last sentence of (b)(1).
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2016 amendment deleted the former second sentence of (b)(1) which read: “The administrative director of the courts shall notify the chairs of the civil justice and finance, ways and means committees of the house of representatives and the judiciary and finance, ways and means committees of the senate each time the compensation of any member of the board is increased.”

      Attorney General Opinions. Even though administrative law judges have already limited nonlawyer corporate representatives to giving an oral statement on the record, the nonlawyer representative of a corporation should exercise caution when providing an oral statement as this practice would appear to present the potential for the unauthorized practice of law that could only be resolved on a case-by-case basis, OAG 04-160 (11/10/04).
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   A nonlawyer corporate agent cannot initiate a contested case hearing by filing an initial pleading as this action would be in a “representative capacity,” would constitute the “practice of law” under this section and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-103" target="_self">23-3-103</a></cite>, and would be considered the unauthorized practice of law if any aspect of the undertaking or conduct requires the “professional judgment of a lawyer,” OAG 04-160 (11/10/04).

   Compiler's Notes. Acts 1997, ch. 345, § 1 provided that the supreme court be encouraged to study the feasibility of creating an inactive license category that allows attorneys to perform pro bono service only for those persons receiving service from organizations that have received a determination of exemption under <cite class="us_code">26 U.S.C. § 501(c)</cite>(3)..

       In a civil action the trial court has a right to fix reasonable rules in the conduct of trials for the dispatch of business, and may in his sound discretion limit the number of counsel and the time to be heard; but where he abuses his discretion a party should object and except to the ruling and save his exception in a motion for a new trial.

       In a divorce case, the trial court acted within its discretion in prohibiting a spouse from self-representation where the spouse physically attacked the other spouse's attorney. Wright v. Quillen, 909 S.W.2d 804, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 195 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).

       Because a surviving spouse's pro se wrongful death complaint asserted claims on behalf of another individual and was not signed by a licensed attorney, the filing of that complaint was a nullity; the surviving spouse was not a licensed attorney and could not file a valid complaint that asserted claims on behalf of another individual without it being signed by a licensed attorney, and since the complaint was a nullity and had no legal effect, it did not operate to toll the statute of limitations.

       The principle of the organic law, Tenn. Const. art. I, § 21, which forbids the demand of any man's particular services, without just compensation, has no application to cases of counsel assigned for poor persons. House v. Whitis, 64 Tenn. 690, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1875); State v. Henley, 98 Tenn. 665, 41 S.W. 352, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1897).

       The court has a right to command the services of counsel for persons unable to pay, in civil as well as criminal cases, for a lawyer takes his license burdened with these honorary obligations, and when commanded by court, he must perform these services, though he receive no compensation therefor. Wright v. State, 50 Tenn. 256, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 89 (1871); House v. Whitis, 64 Tenn. 690, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1875).

      <p>
       The fee of the guardian ad litem cannot be taxed as costs or otherwise against the successful opposite party, although the ward may be without funds to pay it. Attorneys are required to serve without compensation in such cases. Patton v. Dixon, 105 Tenn. 97, 58 S.W. 299, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1900).

       The attorney claiming compensation must look to the party whom he serves and not to the county or state nor to the adverse party. House v. Whitis, 64 Tenn. 690, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1875); State v. Henley, 98 Tenn. 665, 41 S.W. 352, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 156 (1897).

       A guardian ad litem is entitled to compensation for his services in conducting the suit for his ward, and he is entitled to a lien for the same upon the property protected in the suit against his ward, whether it be realty or personalty. Kerbaugh v. Vance, 73 Tenn. 113, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 92 (1880); Persons v. Young, 75 Tenn. 293, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1881).

      <p>
       While the guardian ad litem is entitled to compensation for his services and to a lien therefor on property protected by his services, whether it be realty or personalty, the court, in all cases where it can be done, should preserve the corpus of the estate, if realty, and should have it rented out, and the rents applied to the payment of the fee.

       Generally, clients have the right to change attorneys at any time, and to substitute other counsel during the further progress of the litigation, which right does not preclude the discharged counsel from recovering compensation. Spofford v. Rose, 145 Tenn. 583, 237 S.W. 68, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1922).

       Nothing could justify the discharge of the attorney in the face of his contract, except the fact of disbarment, soliciting business or improper conduct of the suit instituted. No information concerning him, however plausible and misleading it might be, if not true, could excuse a breach of his contract of employment. Brownlow v. Payne, 2 Tenn. App. 154, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).

       In order for an attorney who represents a client in divorce proceedings, which client subsequently declares bankruptcy, to have a lien on the alimony award which secures the attorney's right to payment for services, the divorce decree must mention the attorney's fees; otherwise the attorney is merely an unsecured creditor.

       This statute, extending the lien of attorneys, has not the effect to render defendants liable for the fees of plaintiff's attorneys. The attorney's right in all cases is limited by the amount that his client recovers or receives upon verdict, or good faith compromise. Illinois Cent. R.R. v.

       Except by express agreement, an attorney has a lien only for services in asserting some affirmative cause of action for his client by claim, or counterclaim, and cannot claim a lien, under this section, for services rendered in defeating the claim of client's adversary to a fund admittedly due client under an insurance policy, but a client may make a valid agreement to give his attorney a lien on a fund or decree in controversy, for services rendered.

       Attorneys for the plaintiff in a divorce action where the attorneys' fees were apportioned between the plaintiff and the defendant do not have a lien on property which the plaintiff received as a result of the action for the portion of the attorneys' fees to be paid by the defendant.

       While a “charging” lien serves to secure an attorney's fees, it does not function as an adjudication of the rights between the lawyer and the client. A charging lien is based on a lawyer's equitable right to have the fees and costs due for the lawyer's services in a particular action secured by the judgment or recovery in that action. Starks v. Browning, 20 S.W.3d 645, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 528 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).

       A notation on the final judgment memorializing plaintiffs' attorneys' lien did not constitute a judgment for attorney's fees, and more particularly, it did not constitute a judgment ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs' attorney's fees.

   Plaintiff's right of action is merged in his judgment when one is rendered, and in the compromise when one is made; and the amount specified in the one or in the other is the measure of the defendant's liability. The lien in favor of the plaintiff's attorney follows the transition without interruption, and simply attaches to that into which the right of action is merged. If a judicial recovery is obtained, the lien attaches to that; if a compromise agreement is made, the lien attaches to that; and in each case, the attorney's interest is such that it cannot be defeated or satisfied by a voluntary payment to his client without his consent.

   Where an action, in which plaintiff's attorney has a lien, is compromised and dismissed, without the consent of the attorney, upon the defendant's payment, or agreement to pay the plaintiff a fixed sum, the proper practice is to enter judgment for the compromise amount, to be satisfied by the payment of the fee of the plaintiff's attorney, when the amount of such fee shall be fixed by agreement or other appropriate legal proceedings. Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Wells, 104 Tenn. 706, 59 S.W. 1041, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1900); Tompkins v. Railroad, 110 Tenn. 157, 72 S.W. 116, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 49, 100 Am.

       Where defendant paid $75.00 to the plaintiff in compromise, but, upon the refusal of the plaintiff to allow any part of this sum to be appropriated to the payment of the fees of his attorneys, the defendant paid an additional sum of $75.00 into court under agreement for the benefit of the plaintiff's attorneys, not as a part of the compromise sum paid to plaintiff in satisfaction of his right of action, but as a recognition and provision for the legal rights of the plaintiff's attorneys, which they might have enforced, if it had not been voluntarily paid, such voluntary payment does not entitle plaintiff's attorneys to a lien enforceable against the defendant, on the theory that the suit was in fact compromised for $150.

       If attorneys, who filed a divorce bill for the wife, attaching the husband's property, had any lien at all for services upon the attached property after the wife's voluntary dismissal of her suit (which the court did not concede), such lien could not be enforced by petition filed in the original cause, without attachment of property, six months after final decree upon such voluntary dismissal, and after the term of court at which such final decree was rendered had passed.

       Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a District of Columbia law firm's attorney's lien even though the firm's attorney never sought admission pro hac vice because the issue regarding the firm's compliance with the rules governing out-of-state attorneys went to the declaration of the lien; the firm's client, a wife involved in divorce litigation, agreed by contract to give the firm an enforceable charging lien, which was not contingent on pro hac vice admission.

       Sanctions were warranted because there was no legal basis for filing a lien to secure the quantum meruit claim and thereby requiring the estate to seek a court order requiring appellant to release the lien as the quantum meruit claim appellant asserted was for services rendered in a life insurance proceeds matter that had nothing to do with the property she alleged was hers based on a quitclaim deed; the insurance matter was not a right of action to which an attorney's lien would apply; and, to the extent appellant sought payment for services rendered in representing the decedent, her mother, in the life insurance matter, she should have done so as a creditor of the estate.

      A personal representative of an estate may prepare and file petitions, orders, and similar documents without the assistance of an attorney; however, because the preparation of such a form to be used before a probate court calls for the professional judgment of a lawyer and, therefore, constitutes the “practice of law,” it is not appropriate for a non-attorney member of the clerk and master's office to prepare and distribute form petitions for use by persons seeking to administer an estate without the assistance of an attorney, OAG 01-071 (5/7/01).

     </p>
     <p>
      There is no particular court which has exclusive original jurisdiction over unauthorized practice of law questions; courts generally have the inherent authority to address such questions, OAG 02-078 (7/3/02).
     </p>
     <p>
      A non-lawyer's conduct in filling in the blanks of a form contract for the sale, financing, or leasing of tangible personal property does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law, assuming the decision concerning what information to place on the form does not require the exercise of legal training, skill, or judgment, OAG 02-078 (7/3/02).
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not the unauthorized practice of law for a court to develop form petitions and orders and to direct non-attorney members of the clerk's office to make petitions available for use by pro se litigants seeking to have their driving privileges restored, OAG 04-071 (4/21/04).

      Conduct of “public adjuster” may constitute unauthorized practice of law, OAG 05-076 (5/10/05).

     <p>
      A lobbyist who is not licensed as an attorney is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law only if he or she, in the course of lobbying, is rendering services that call for the professional judgment of a lawyer, OAG 05-132 (8/24/05).
     </p>
     <p>
      Attorney General Opinion No. 05-076 does not conclude that the practice of public adjusting per se constitutes the unauthorized practice of law in Tennessee, OAG 05-133 (8/26/05).

      Mediation does not involve the practice of law, OAG 06-079 (4/27/06).

      Whether the preparation by non-lawyers of certain real estate documents would constitute unauthorized practice depends on whether the preparation of the documents would require the professional judgment of a lawyer, OAG 07-088 (6/6/07).

   Judges and chancellors are prohibited from practicing law in any of the courts of this state. A newly elected or appointed judge or chancellor can practice law only in an effort to wind up the judge or chancellor's practice, ceasing to practice as soon as reasonably possible and in no event longer than one hundred eighty (180) days after assuming office. The clerks of the several courts and their deputies are also prohibited from practicing in their own courts, or in any causes commenced, brought to or carried from their courts, or commenced in any court from which an appeal lies to their court. Sheriffs and other executive officers shall not practice law in the county for which they were elected, or in any cause, originating or pending in the courts of that county. With the exception of judges, chancellors and justices, nothing in this section or any other law shall be construed to prohibit employees of the executive and judicial branches of the government of this state who are licensed to practice law in this state from voluntarily providing pro bono legal services through an organized program of pro bono legal services that receives funding pursuant to §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.16.html#t16c03s16-3-808" target="_blank">16-3-808</a></cite> and that provides professional liability insurance for losses sustained by clients of lawyers participating in the program.

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Communications between a client and his attorney are under the seal of confidence, and cannot be disclosed in proof. It is not necessary to the application of this rule that a suit should be pending or anticipated, nor that there should be a regular retainer, or the payment of a fee, but the communication must be in a professional character, in relation to some past act, or right or interest in existence. McMannus v. State, 39 Tenn. 213, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 282 (1858).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not apply to transactions between attorney and client where they have no element of confidence in them. The attorney is competent to testify about them. For instance, he may prove his client's handwriting, what money was collected by him, when paid over, and to whom paid. Johnson v. Patterson, 81 Tenn. 626, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The privilege assumes, of course, that the communications are made with the intention of confidentiality, and the reason for prohibiting disclosure ceases when the client does not appear to have been desirous of secrecy. Hazlett v. Bryant, 192 Tenn. 251, 241 S.W.2d 121, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 399 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence of attempted perpetration of fraud found in the attorney-client discussions the defendant sought to have admitted into evidence and, therefore, the attorney-client privilege will bar the admission into evidence of such discussions. Galland—Henning Mfg. Co. v. Dempster Bros., Inc., 315 F. Supp. 68, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13119 (E.D. Tenn. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney-client privilege is not absolute, nor does it encompass all communications between the client and the attorney. For the privilege to apply, the client has the burden of showing that the communications were made in the confidence of the attorney-client relationship and with the intention of confidentiality. Bryan v. State, 848 S.W.2d 72, 1992 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 679 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements for the privilege to apply are: (1) The asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client or is a member of the bar or the member's subordinate; (2) The communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed by the client without the presence of strangers, for the purpose of securing primarily either an opinion on law or legal services or assistance in some legal proceeding and not for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (3) The privilege has been claimed and not waived by the client. Royal Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Sofamor Danek Group, Inc., 190 F.R.D. 463, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22616 (W.D. Tenn. 1998), aff'd, 190 F.R.D. 463, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23632 (W.D. Tenn. 1999).

        4. Extent of Privilege.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The attorney-client privilege rule does not apply to the identity of an attorney's client. State v. Bobo, 724 S.W.2d 760, 1981 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 434 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a party was induced to make communications because he had retained the attorney to “aid in having the deed made to his wife in lieu of himself,” the retainer for this purpose was sufficient to seal the lips of the attorney as to any communications on the subject of the client's motives. Lockhard v. Brodie, 1 Tenn. Ch. 384 (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney-client privilege codified in this section does not exclude all communications between an attorney and his client. Humphreys, Hutcheson & Moseley v. Donovan, 568 F. Supp. 161, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16081 (M.D. Tenn. 1983), aff'd, 755 F.2d 1211, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 29481 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent special circumstances, the attorney-client privilege does not prohibit disclosure of the fact or the existence of an attorney-client relationship or the dates that services were rendered. Nor does the privilege, absent special circumstances, foreclose disclosure of the amount of money paid by a client for services. Humphreys, Hutcheson & Moseley v. Donovan, 568 F. Supp. 161, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16081 (M.D. Tenn. 1983), aff'd, 755 F.2d 1211, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 29481 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where a textile company facing a union election had its corporate attorney speak to the employees prior to the election regarding the dangers of unionizing, the attorney-client privilege did not bar the attorney from disclosing and reporting the information required by the Labor Management Reporting and disclosure Act of 1959 (<cite class="us_code">29 U.S.C. § 401</cite> et seq.) from every person involved in labor persuader activities, because the attorney was not acting as an attorney when he engaged in those speeches but as a labor persuader. Humphreys, Hutcheson &amp; Moseley v. Donovan, 568 F. Supp. 161, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16081 (M.D. Tenn. 1983), aff'd, 755 F.2d 1211, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 29481 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The evidentiary privilege afforded by this section was waived by the passage of the Open Meetings Act (§§<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c44s8-44-101" target="_blank">8-44-101</a></cite> —<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.08.html#t08c44s8-44-106" target="_blank">8-44-106</a></cite>); however, because of the attorney's ethical duty not to betray the confidences of his client, discussions between a public body and its attorney concerning pending litigation may be held in private and are not subject to the Open Meetings Act. Smith County Education Asso. v. Anderson, 676 S.W.2d 328, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 936 (Tenn. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Affidavit that a former client claimed was unnecessarily prejudicial to him which stated that his previous attorney was the third of eight attorneys to represent the client during his divorce and that the client's adultery went unabated despite an attempt at reconciliation, did not constitute privileged communications between the client and his attorney because they were statements of fact that were already public record prior to the filing of the attorney's affidavit. Hartman v. Cunningham, 217 S.W.3d 408, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 709 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 186 (Tenn. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court had not erred in granting summary judgment to an attorney who was accused by his client in another proceeding of committing malpractice because the attorney had filed the affidavit in response to that accusation; even if the affidavit had contained privileged information, the communication was permissible pursuant to Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. Prof. Conduct 8, RPC 1.6(b) because the attorney reasonably believed that disclosure was necessary to defend against the allegations and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-105" target="_self">23-3-105</a></cite> did not provide the client a private right of action. Hartman v. Cunningham, 217 S.W.3d 408, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 709 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 186 (Tenn. 2007).

       <p>
   Employer state’s documents relating to harassment investigations were protected from public disclosure under the Public Records Act, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.10.html#t10c07s10-7-505" target="_blank">10-7-505</a></cite>, by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine; the rule governing confidences established in Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.6, makes no exceptions for governmental attorneys, and the fact that the documents may have been prepared for the purpose of policy compliance as well as in anticipation of litigation did not remove them from the privilege or the doctrine. The Tennessean v. Tenn. Dep't of Pers., — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 267 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2007).

       In a protestor's civil rights action against the former Governor and Deputy Governor, alleging retaliation for the exercise of his First Amendment rights, the attorney client privilege applied to certain documents created by the Governor's legal counsel because the documents specifically related to the attorney's analysis of questions presented by the Governor, issues surrounding the protest at the Capitol, and reflected advice given to the Governor and his advisors in that regard.

       Communications that defendant had with the victim's best friend, an attorney, were not subject to the attorney-client privilege, because the attorney informed both defendant and the officers that she did not represent defendant and was at the crime scene as a friend. State v. Jackson, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1003 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 10, 2012), modified, 444 S.W.3d 554, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. Aug. 22, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of an attorney's repeated statements to defendant that the attorney was not acting as defendant's attorney, but was present at the scene because of the attorney's friendship with the victim, the trial court's finding that the attorney could testify, as defendant had no reasonable belief or expectation that the attorney had assented to the formation of an attorney-client relationship, was not clearly erroneous. State v. Jackson, 444 S.W.3d 554, 2014 Tenn. LEXIS 619 (Tenn. Aug. 22, 2014).

       Trial court did not err by allowing an inmate to testify because he and defendant did not have an attorney-client relationship, as the inmate was not an attorney and he did not tell defendant he was an attorney, and therefore their communications were not privileged.

       Counsel was not licensed to practice law prior to the filing of the suit, thereby establishing that her discussions with plaintiffs prior to her licensure were not subject to the attorney-client privilege; defendants intended to illicit testimony from counsel concerning the main issue at trial, namely when the construction defects were discovered, and the court upheld the disqualification of counsel.

       Attorney-client privilege did not protect communications between the wife and her divorce attorney and a criminal defense attorney because the wife had not met her burden of proof to establish that the privilege applied to any specific communication at issue; the wife did not show which meeting or meetings her friend was present for and which she was not.

      <p>
       Attorney-client privilege applies to communications between an entity's legal counsel and a third-party nonemployee of the entity if the nonemployee is the functional equivalent of the entity's employee and when the communications relate to the subject matter of legal counsel's representation of the entity and the communications were made with the intention that they would be kept confidential. Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Medley, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (Tenn. Jan. 25, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court may find that a third-party nonemployee is the functional equivalent of an employee after considering the following non-exclusive factors: whether the nonemployee performs a specific role on behalf of the entity, whether the nonemployee acts as a representative of the entity, whether the nonemployee possesses information no one else has, whether the nonemployee is authorized by the entity to communicate with its attorneys, and whether the nonemployee's communications with the entity's attorneys are treated as confidential. Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Medley, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (Tenn. Jan. 25, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a court determines that the nonemployee's communications qualify for the attorney-client privilege because the nonemployee is the functional equivalent of an employee, then the court should use the standard already in place in Tennessee to determine whether the privilege attaches. Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Medley, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (Tenn. Jan. 25, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property management company was the functional equivalent of an employee of the corporation, the communications related to the subject matter of counsel's representation of the corporation, and the communications were made with the intent that they would be kept confidential; the trial court properly found the documents in question were protected by the attorney-client privilege. Dialysis Clinic, Inc. v. Medley, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (Tenn. Jan. 25, 2019).
