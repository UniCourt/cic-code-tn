       Mere act of codification of statutes for publication in the code does not cure defects in the passage but the enactment of the codified statutes into the code by the general assembly does cure such defects. Keaton v. State, 212 Tenn. 690, 372 S.W.2d 163, 1963 Tenn. LEXIS 459 (1963).

       The court rejected the contention that, under this section, if the act is void because the body is broader than the caption, then codification cannot cure the defect. Nichols v. Tullahoma Open Door, Inc., 640 S.W.2d 13, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 478 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

       Where the compiler added parenthetical reference to sections of the United States Code (U.S.C.) following the reference to the federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, but the original act passed by the general assembly and signed by the governor contained no reference to any U.S.C. sections, the court held that such parenthetical references were mere surplusage and could in no way alter the sense or meaning of the act.

       The Code of 1932 was constitutionally enacted. The title of the codification act related to a single and unified subject of codification of the statutes, collecting and compiling the statutes in a logical and concise form, and expressing the jural sense of the state.

   All sections of the code will be construed together in order to determine whether code provisions changed the prior existing law, since repeal by implication is not favored by the courts.

       It was the intention of the legislature, in adopting this section, to provide against the rule of common law that when suit has been commenced the repeal of a statute does away with the right of suit. Wallace v. Goodlett, 104 Tenn. 670, 58 S.W. 343, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1900).

       The provision applies to statutes enacted or repealed subsequent to the adoption of the Code as well as to the sections of the Code which may have been repealed. Shelby Co. v. Mississippi & T. R. Co., 84 Tenn. 401, 1 S.W. 32, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1886); Wallace v. Goodlett, 104 Tenn. 670, 58 S.W. 343, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1900); Gass v. State, 130 Tenn. 581, 172 S.W. 305, 1914 Tenn.

       The repeal of a statute does not affect accrued rights, imposed duties, incurred penalties, nor pending proceedings. Wallace v. Goodlett, 104 Tenn. 670, 58 S.W. 343, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1900); Standard Oil Co. v. State, 117 Tenn. 618, 100 S.W. 705, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 71, 10 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1015 (1907); Nashville R. & L. Co. v. Norvell, 122 Tenn. 613, 124 S.W. 613, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since by this section the repeal of a statute did not affect any right which accrued or proceeding which was commenced under a repealed statute, an act which repealed one section and amended another was not applicable to suits brought against a railroad that arose out of an accident that occurred before the enactment of the act but were commenced after the act went into effect. Southern R. Co. v. Miller, 285 F.2d 202, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 3074, 85 A.L.R.2d 842 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1960).

   Where work was performed for city and after work was done the method by which payment was to be made was declared unconstitutional and as a result the legislature authorized the city to levy a tax to pay for such work, contractor who obtained judgment for work performed and instituted mandamus proceedings to obtain the levy to satisfy the judgment was not deprived of his remedy when act authorizing the levy was repealed before levy actually was made. Memphis v. United States, <cite class="us_code">97 U.S. 293</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">24 L. Ed. 920</cite>, 1877 U.S. LEXIS 1776 (1878).

      <p>
       Change in statutory method of collecting taxes does not deprive official of fees actually earned at the time. Sherrill v. Thomason, 145 Tenn. 499, 238 S.W. 876, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Public Acts 1919, ch. 90, effective in April, 1919, repealed provisions of code giving right of jury trial to either party in chancery cases, a jury trial in chancery case held in August, 1919, was proper where the proceedings were instituted in January, 1919. Johnston v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 146 Tenn. 135, 240 S.W. 429, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1921).
      </p>

       Where a right or benefit is conferred upon a person by statute such benefit or right is not lost by its repeal. Hutton v. State, 175 Tenn. 44, 131 S.W.2d 11, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Public Acts 1937, ch. 154 permitted a person committed to the county jail or workhouse for nonpayment of fine or costs to be discharged on oath of insolvency, a prisoner to whom such right accrued during the time such statute was in effect was entitled to such relief even though the act was repealed without any saving clause prior to the time he would have been entitled to a release. Hutton v. State, 175 Tenn. 44, 131 S.W.2d 11, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1939).

       A conviction may be had upon an indictment or presentment for an offense that was unlawful at the time of the finding, although the statute upon which the proceeding is based is repealed, without any saving clause, before conviction. Richardson v. State, 43 Tenn. 122, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1866); Hill v. State, 73 Tenn. 725, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 206 (Dec. 1880); Gass v. State, 130 Tenn. 581, 172 S.W. 305, 1914 Tenn.

      <p>
       The repeal of a statute levying a tax will not affect the liability of a person against whom the tax has accrued. State v. Nashville Sav. Bank, 84 Tenn. 111, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1885); Shelby Co. v. Mississippi & T. R. Co., 84 Tenn. 401, 1 S.W. 32, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, assessments made prior to the repeal of the law authorizing such assessments are unaffected by such repealing law. Shelby Co. v. Mississippi & T. R. Co., 84 Tenn. 401, 1 S.W. 32, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeding for back assessment of taxes, commenced under a statute, is not affected by its subsequent repeal. Nashville R. & L. Co. v. Norvell, 122 Tenn. 613, 124 S.W. 613, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       A statute prohibiting the back assessment or reassessment of property which has been assessed, as applied to suits already commenced, is not affected by this section, because the statute is not a repealing statute. State ex rel. Woolen v. Pearson, 137 Tenn. 253, 192 S.W. 164, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1917).

       <span class="boldspan">
        9. —Penalties.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section did not apply where the section providing the penalty for first-degree murder was amended changing the method of inflicting the death penalty, as it was the purpose of the legislature that the death penalty should be inflicted by electrocution rather than hanging in all cases where the sentence of death was pronounced after the amendment was effective, regardless of whether the crime was committed before or after the passage of the act. Shipp v. State, 130 Tenn. 491, 172 S.W. 317, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       A penalty never vests but continues to be executory. The repeal of a penalty statute is not within the saving of this section, and a penalty could not be enforced after repeal. O. H. May Co. v. Anderson, 156 Tenn. 216, 300 S.W. 12, 1927 Tenn. LEXIS 105 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a subsequent penal statute changes a punishment, the former mode is thereby repealed. Stinson v. State, 208 Tenn. 159, 344 S.W.2d 369, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 409 (1961), superseded by statute as stated in, State v. Gray, — S.W.2d —, 1994 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 495 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 4, 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeal of a penal statute operates as a pardon of all offenses committed before such repeal unless the right to prosecute is saved by a provision in the repealing act or by separate legislation. Stinson v. State, 208 Tenn. 159, 344 S.W.2d 369, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 409 (1961), superseded by statute as stated in, State v. Gray, — S.W.2d —, 1994 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 495 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 4, 1994).

      <p>
       The change of a law by statute between the trial and appeal does not change the rights of the parties. Gaines v. Catron, 20 Tenn. 514, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1840); Garnett v. Stockton, 26 Tenn. 84, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1846).

       Subsequent legislation curing defective probate and registration cannot affect rights under a decree thereon previously rendered. Garnett v. Stockton, 26 Tenn. 84, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1846).

       Prior to the adoption of § 49 of the Code of 1858, it was held not only that punishment must be according to the law existing when the offense was committed, but also that such law must be valid and subsisting at the trial.

       The provisions of this section apply when the computation of time begins on the happening of some event or the performance of some act, and the performance of some act within a given length of time thereafter is indispensable in order that some right may be saved or that some liability may be avoided. They have no application to the computation of the time of service and return of process. Dickinson v. Lee, 42 Tenn. 615, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1866).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section have no application to acts required to be done by private contract where the time for performance is stipulated. Shankle v. Home Ins. Co., 175 Tenn. 228, 133 S.W.2d 489, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to acts provided by law to be done, and does not apply to a situation involving the last day of the grace period of an insurance policy falling on Sunday. Simpkins v. Business Men's Assurance Co., 31 Tenn. App. 306, 215 S.W.2d 1, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 93 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is a statutory enactment of the common-law rule. Needham v. Moore, 200 Tenn. 445, 292 S.W.2d 720, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 428, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 429 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section merely provides a method for the computation of time “within which any act provided by law is to be done.” It does not purport to change the common-law method of age computation. State v. Alley, 594 S.W.2d 381, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 403 (Tenn. 1980).

       While this section does not embrace an order giving time “until” a certain date to perform an act, an order of the court giving “until” a specified day to file a bill of exceptions included that day. Blaylock v. State, 108 Tenn. 185, 65 S.W. 398, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1901).

      <p>
       Where the defendant immediately following a final decree on September 24, 1942, was allowed 30 days in which to file his bill of exceptions, which time was later extended an additional 30 days, the bill of exception filed on November 24, 1942 came too late in that it was filed 61 days after the final decree. Fletcher v. Russell, 27 Tenn. App. 44, 177 S.W.2d 854, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 127 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943), overruled in part on other grounds, J. C. Bradford & Co. v. Martin Constr.

       Circuit court erred in dismissing an appeal of a legal malpractice action merely because appellant entered the wrong docket number on her notice of appeal and appeal bond; the appeal was otherwise timely filed.

      <p>
       Tenn. R. Civ. P. 6.01 did not apply to the computation of time of an appeal from a general sessions court because the Tennessee rules of civil procedure did not apply to the action of general sessions courts; the issue of computation was controlled by the general law.

       While this statute relates only to acts provided by law to be done, it is in accord with sound principles to say that the rule prescribed is a sound one to be observed in the interpretation of contracts, where no different meaning is given by the instrument, or where no different intention is manifest from the contract. Cowan v. Donaldson, 95 Tenn. 322, 32 S.W. 457, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1895); Allen v. Effler, 144 Tenn. 685, 235 S.W. 67, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1921); Allen v.

       Whether the day on which a contract is executed is to be included or excluded, under the provision for performance within a specified number of days “from” the day of execution of the contract is to be determined according to the tenor of the instrument and the intent of the parties. Allen v. Effler, 144 Tenn. 685, 235 S.W. 67, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 64 (1921).

       The same rule as provided by this section for computation of time as to acts required by law has been applied by the courts to private contracts. Dobson & Johnson, Inc. v. Waldron, 47 Tenn. App. 121, 336 S.W.2d 313, 1960 Tenn. App. LEXIS 74 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1960).

       Where there are two provisions, one of which is special and particular and certainly includes the matter in question, and the other general and if standing alone would include the same matter and conflict with the special act or provision, the special must be taken as intended to constitute an exception to the general.

       By the well settled rules of interpretation, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine. This rule is embodied in this section. Ex parte Brien, 2 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 33 (1874); Balch v. Johnson, 106 Tenn. 249, 61 S.W. 289, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 159 (1901).

       The word “widow,” as used in the statute, allowing damages for a wrongful death, includes both the feminine and masculine gender, so that the surviving husband, as “widower” is entitled to the damages recoverable for the wrongful death of his wife.

       Since this section provides that words importing the masculine gender include the feminine and no proof that women have been systematically excluded from the office of grand jury foreman was offered, a statute referring to the “foreman” of a jury does not create a classification based on sex in violation of the sixth amendment.

   Substituting “comparable feminine terms” for the words like “man” or “father,” as the non-biological parent proposed, goes beyond allowing words written in one gender be construed, where necessary, to apply to the other, and exceeds the purpose of the parentage statute; no rights or relationships are created by the parentage statutes, only a procedure by which the father is able to establish parentage and as such, recourse to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c03s1-3-104ol1b" target="_self">1-3-104(b)</a></cite> for other purposes is not warranted.

   Attorney General Opinions. Senate Bill 1085/House Bill 1111, 110th Gen. Assem. (2017), which would codify one of the most basic canons of statutory construction, the “ordinary-meaning canon,” could be construed as a violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine embodied in the Tennessee Constitution.  In construing certain statutes with gender-limiting words, a court would likely apply the very specific gender-inclusive requirements of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c03s1-3-104ol1b" target="_self">1-3-104(b)</a></cite> rather than the very general “ordinary meaning” requirements of the proposed legislation.   OAG 17-29, 2017 Tenn.AG LEXIS 28 (4/13/2017).

       <p>
   The code definitions were not intended to be limited to the words as used by the code, but extend to the words whenever used in subsequent statutes. Wiley v. State, 43 Tenn. 362, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1866); Cowan v. Murch, 97 Tenn. 590, 37 S.W. 393, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 186, <cite class="lra">34 L.R.A. 538</cite>, (1896); Carroll v. Alsup, 107 Tenn. 257, 64 S.W. 193, 1901 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       These definitions are not applicable to common-law terms not embraced in the statutory system. Lewis v. Glass, 92 Tenn. 147, 20 S.W. 571, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       The definitions apply not only to the statutes in the code as enacted, but to all amendments thereof, which include all statutes passed since its enactment, in the absence of a contrary intention or purpose expressed in the statutes themselves. Standard Oil Co. v. State, 117 Tenn. 618, 100 S.W. 705, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 71, 10 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1015 (1907).

   Owners and operators of a farm, who operated a pumpkin patch and corn maze and conducted concerts on their property, were protected from the application of the local zoning laws by the Tennessee Right-to-Farm Act, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.43.html#t43c26s43-26-101" target="_blank">43-26-101</a></cite> et seq., because their farm activities were sufficient to meet the definition of agritourism. Shore v. Maple Lane Farms, LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 229 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2012), rev'd, 411 S.W.3d 405, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. Aug. 19, 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the statutory definitions of “agriculture” include recreational and educational activities, they do not include entertainment activities; therefore, entertainment activities occurring on a farm are not an agricultural use that exempts the related land, buildings, or other structures from local zoning regulation. Shore v. Maple Lane Farms, LLC, 411 S.W.3d 405, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. Aug. 19, 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Music concerts a neighbor hosted on his farm could not claim the benefit of the exemption contained in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.13.html#t13c07s13-7-114" target="_blank">13-7-114</a></cite> from compliance with a county's zoning resolution because they did not fall within the rubric of “agriculture”; without the exemption, a homeowner's evidence established that the neighbor violated both the county zoning resolution and the order of the county board of zoning appeals limiting the concerts to one per year. Shore v. Maple Lane Farms, LLC, 411 S.W.3d 405, 2013 Tenn. LEXIS 644 (Tenn. Aug. 19, 2013).

       An administrator de bonis non is embraced and described in our statutes by the general description of administrator, whether by such statutes powers are given, or duties imposed. Schackelford v. Runyan, 26 Tenn. 141, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1846); Coleman v. Raynor, 43 Tenn. 25, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1866); Minor v. Webb, 48 Tenn. 395, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1870); Whitaker v.

      </p>
      <p>
       An act of the general assembly passed after the adoption of the code, empowering a bank to act as executor, includes power to act as administrator. This section applies to later enactments. Union Bank & Trust Co. v. Wright, 58 S.W. 755, 1900 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 50 (1900).

   While the word “person” includes a “corporation,” within the purview of the statute that excludes absence from the state in computing the time for the running of the statute of limitations, a foreign corporation that has never complied with our statutes for its domestication, but has continually, for the period requisite for the running of the statute, operated its business within the state, maintaining an office, with officers and agents subject, under our statutes, to service of process that binds it, is entitled to plead and rely upon the statute of limitations to the same extent as a domestic corporation. Turcott v. Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. Co., 101 Tenn. 102, 45 S.W. 1067, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 37, 70 Am. St. Rep. 661, <cite class="lra">40 L.R.A. 768</cite> (1898); Boro v.

       Because collateral estoppel did not apply, the circuit court did not commit any error in hearing and deciding on the merits a company's action against a former wife for money she had taken from the company and which the divorce court had determined was a debt she owed to the company; the company, which had been jointly owned by the former husband and the wife, was not a party to the divorce case, and it was an entity separate and apart from the husband and was its own legal person.

       Where there is a discrepancy between the amount expressed in words and in figures, the writing is not necessarily rendered void for uncertainty, for either the words will prevail, or the words and figures will be read together, and any defect in either corrected by the other. It will only be after all efforts to produce a harmonious result have failed, that the writing will be held void for uncertainty. If the figures are complete, and the words are incomplete and show an omission, the inference is unavoidable that there was a clerical misprision by omission, and the amount in words will be corrected by the amount expressed in figures, and the omission supplied.

       Employee had no private right of action under the Tennessee Tip Statute because, while the employee was an intended beneficiary, (1) the statute did not expressly provide such a right, and (2) no such right was implied, as the doctrine of legislative inaction did not apply to show legislative acquiescence in a judicial decision implying the right, since that decision was inconsistent with subsequent jurisprudence on implication of a private right of action, as the decision reflected a willingness to imply a private remedy so long as doing so was not inconsistent with either the purpose of the statute or any criminal or administrative remedies expressly provided therein, but courts had retreated from that approach in favor of one presuming a legislature would expressly provide for a private remedy if it intended there to be one.
