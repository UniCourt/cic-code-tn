       The very simple statutory procedure for contesting incompetency by the ward of a conservatorship affords adequate procedural due process, and the statutes do not unjustifiably restrict a ward's liberty in violation of substantive due process or the right to equal protection.

       An action challenging the constitutionality of conservatorship laws was within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine and the case did not become moot when the conservatorship involved was dissolved.

       Trial court properly granted the Tennessee Department of Correction (TDOC) a limited conservatorship over an inmate and the authority to consent to forcible treatment on his behalf because the order was the least restrictive means of furthering TDOC's compelling interest; assuming the imposition of a limited conservatorship was governed by Tenn. Const. art. I, § 13, the practice was not unnecessary because there was significant evidence it was necessary to treat serious mental health issues. State Dep't of Corr. v. Todd, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 223 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2017), review denied and ordered not published, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 518 (Tenn. Aug. 17, 2017).

       Trial court properly granted the Tennessee Department of Correction a limited conservatorship over an inmate and the authority to consent to forcible treatment on his behalf because the inmate suffered from a mental illness and experienced significant mental health issues that were ameliorated by appropriate treatment; due to the lack of a transcript, the record on appeal contained no evidence of the actual side effects the inmate experienced or that he was likely to experience.

      <p>
       Trial court in a conservatorship action properly appointed the ward's spouse as the conservator because clear and convincing supported the finding that the ward was fully disabled and in need of a conservator as a doctor opined in a physician's report that, based upon the ward's medical history and nature and type of disability, the ward was in need of a conservator and was incapable of managing the ward's own financial affairs and health care decisions. Another evaluator recommended the ward's admission to a long-term memory care facility. In re Williams, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 190 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2018).

       Where a comatose veteran's wife was appointed conservator of the estate and person of her husband, the trial court erred in denying her an appropriate hearing on her petition to remove a bank as co-conservator and to retain control over the medical malpractice litigation that she had filed on behalf of her husband in federal court.

       Parents are the joint natural guardians of their minor children, and are equally and jointly charged with their care, nurture, welfare, education and support and also with the care, management and expenditure of their estates. Each parent has equal powers, rights and duties with respect to the custody of each of their minor children and the control of the services and earnings of each minor child; provided, that so much of the net income of each minor child as may be necessary may be expended by a parent (without the necessity of court authorization) for the child's care, maintenance and education. Funds of a minor held by a guardian shall not be expended to relieve or minimize the obligation of the parent or parents to support the minor.

       Parents shall continue to be responsible for the support of each child for whom they are responsible after the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age if the child is in high school. The duty of support shall continue until the child graduates from high school or the class of which the child is a member when the child attains eighteen (18) years of age graduates, whichever occurs first.

       If the parents of a minor child are divorced, the court may award the guardianship of the property of the minor child to the parent who, in the court's judgment, would best serve the welfare of the minor child and the child's estate. The parent appointed guardian of the child's estate may, but does not have to be, the parent with legal custody. The appointment of a parent as legal guardian does not affect the custodial decree of the divorce court except in those situations in which the guardianship of the minor or legal custody is committed to the department of children's services, in which case the order of the court having jurisdiction of the guardian proceedings or custodial proceedings under title 37 shall control.

       Trial court erred in concluding that a mother had breached a marital dissolution agreement by declining to pay her son's college expenses after discovering that the father and the son had concealed a tuition discount received as a result of the father's employment at the university where the son was enrolled; the conduct of the father and the son excused the mother of further performance of her contractual obligations.

       Child support provision of a marital dissolution agreement (MDA) in which the father agreed to pay, inter alia, twenty-one percent of all bonuses or other income as defined by the child support guidelines was subject to modification because, when the trial court approved the agreement and incorporated the MDA into the final decree of divorce, the twenty-one percent provision merged into the divorce decree, lost its contractual nature, and thus became subject to modification by the trial court.

       While the benefits the father received under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'  Compensation Act were not subject to levy, execution, or collection of a debt, nothing in the Act prevents them from being considered as assets that the father could use to pay child support; the father had the ability to pay child support despite that he was unable to work, his funds had been shielded only by his discretion and that of his trustee, and the father had a duty to support his child under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c01s34-1-102" target="_self">34-1-102</a></cite>.

Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if the guardians of the minor are the parents of the minor and are divorced or legally separated from each other, the court may order that the funds be delivered, all or in part, to either of the parents if the court finds that such order would best serve the welfare of the minor.

       If the guardian's bond is informal and not according to the statute, as where it is made payable to the wrong payee, or the penalty is blank, relief will be granted the ward in chancery, by an account against the principal and sureties. Especially will relief be given in chancery where the sureties have taken indemnity by mortgage on the faith of their liability. Ferrell v. Dooly, 25 Tenn. 110, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1845); Bumpas v.

       A guardian's bond with one surety is good and binding on him since the requirement of two or more sureties is merely directory, but the officer charged with the duty of taking the bond will be liable to the party aggrieved for the damages sustained, if in fact a loss occurred by reason of the failure to require the number of sureties fixed by the statute.

       A guardian is liable for failure to call his predecessor in office to account; but, in such case, where a recovery and satisfaction have been had against him, he is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the wards against the first guardian; or, if he has satisfied the first guardian's deficiency, by the payment and satisfaction of the judgment against himself for his such failure to collect the same from the first guardian and his sureties, he may, by an order of court under the enlarged power of amendment conferred by statute, be substituted on the record as plaintiff in place of the wards in their pending suit against a surety of the first guardian. Smith v. Alexander, 36 Tenn. 482, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1857).

       Where a guardian, from improper motives, procures an advantageous sale of the property of the wards to be set aside for technical reasons avoiding it, against the will of the purchaser, and procures a resale at a loss, he will be held liable for the loss. Mountcastle v. Mills, 58 Tenn. 267, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 258 (1872).

       The guardian's regular or general bond covers the rents of his ward's land during the period held by him under a void judicial sale procured by himself, and at which he became the purchaser, where the sale has been annulled by the chancery court, and the land has been recovered by the wards. Sanders v. Forgasson, 62 Tenn. 249, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 186 (1873).

       Where a guardian, holding a check representing the funds of his wards, but payable to himself individually, deposited it to his personal credit in a bank, by the permission of its assistant cashier, after the guardian had informed him of the facts, both the guardian and the bank were guilty of a conversion of the fund, completed by the entry of the amount of the check to the guardian's personal credit, whereby the bank became a trustee of the fund, and could only be relieved from liability to account therefor by the guardian's subsequent true administration of the trust fund and his accounting therefor.

       While the sureties on the guardian's bond will be released by the ward's acceptance, without their consent, of the guardian's note or order on a third party, after he is of age, for the payment of the amount due from the guardian to the ward. The mere drawing of orders on the guardian by the ward, in favor of third persons, which are accepted by him, does not operate as a discharge of the sureties unless such orders are paid. Bond v.

       Sureties on general bond executed in 1854 were not liable for proceeds received by guardian for sale of land, but sureties on renewal bond executed in 1861 subject to provisions of 1858 Code were liable for proceeds from sale of land in hands of guardian at time of execution.

       The sureties of the guardian may maintain a bill against the guardian and ward to reach a fund converted by the defendant guardian and third persons made defendants and to have it applied to indemnify themselves (the sureties) before any liability has been fixed against them by judgment, where the insolvency of the guardian is alleged and shown. Davidson v. Crisp, 1 Shan. 261 (1873); Adams v. Gleaves, 78 Tenn. 367, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 192 (1882).

       While the sureties of a guardian are entitled to be subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the ward against the guardian (their principal), even before their payment of his default, where he (the guardian) is insolvent, yet the sureties stand no higher than the ward and take such remedies precisely as the ward could take them, that is, with all the equities and limitations existent against him. Adams v. Gleaves, 78 Tenn. 367, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 192 (1882).

       Surety of guardian, paying the wards, was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the wards against a bank, guilty jointly with guardian of conversion of ward's funds, and to recover from it the total deposit, and not merely a small overdraft at the time of the making of the deposit. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. People's Bank, 127 Tenn. 720, 157 S.W. 414, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1913).

       To constitute a regular biennial renewal bond, it is not required that it be executed exactly at the end of the two years.

Jamison v. Cosby & Ferguson, 30 Tenn. 273, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 111 (1850); Collins v. Knight, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 183 (1876); Dibbrell v. Mitchell, 2 Shan. 591 (1877); Tennessee Hosp. v.

       The primary liability of the sureties on a biennial renewal bond is not altered by the fact that the guardian had misappropriated the ward's estate before its execution. The liability of such sureties is coextensive with the guardianship, and relates to the first appointment of the guardian. Crook v. Hudson, 72 Tenn. 448, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1880).

       New sureties on a guardianship bond are cumulative to former sureties and in an action on the bond for damages because of improper investments the fact that the investments were made before the defendant became a surety is no defense for such surety.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Although the statute requires the regular guardian of an infant to make the application for the sale of the infant's lands, a sale contracted by a testamentary guardian without authority, and afterwards confirmed as an advantageous one by a decree rendered in a suit brought by such testamentary guardian against his ward for that purpose, is valid even upon direct attack. Hurt v. Long, 90 Tenn. 445, 16 S.W. 968, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1891).

      <p>
       A husband may file a bill for the sale and reinvestment of the proceeds of his infant wife's realty. McNish v. Bryan, 2 Tenn. Civ. App. (2 Higgins) 443 (1911).

       A bill for an infant's benefit to sell real estate for maintenance and education should be filed by some person with the infant's interest at heart, and should not be entertained when filed by one desiring to purchase the infant's land. Reynolds v. Chumbley, 175 Tenn. 496, 135 S.W.2d 941, 1939 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1940).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The guardian ad litem required by this section may be appointed by the clerk and master, as in other cases. Beaumont v. Beaumont, 54 Tenn. 226, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of guardian ad litem by deputy, when the clerk is complainant, if the chancellor afterwards ratifies the appointment by permitting him to act as the representative of the infant, may not be assigned as error, if it is an irregularity. Hurt v. Long, 90 Tenn. 445, 16 S.W. 968, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       If interest of guardian and ward is likely to be adverse, another should be appointed guardian ad litem. Freeman v. Citizens' Nat'l Bank, 167 Tenn. 399, 70 S.W.2d 25, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of appointing a guardian ad litem is to protect the incompetent in the particular litigation wherein the appointment is made. Goins v. Yowell, 41 Tenn. App. 280, 293 S.W.2d 251, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 167 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although appointment of guardian ad litem can only be made after the incompetent has been brought before the court, where the court has jurisdiction over the property this may be done by publication as well as service of process. Goins v. Yowell, 41 Tenn. App. 280, 293 S.W.2d 251, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 167 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceedings to sell land of allegedly mentally incompetent person in the interest of the incompetent, an adjudication of insanity in a lunacy proceeding was not required as a prerequisite to the appointment of a guardian ad litem. Goins v. Yowell, 41 Tenn. App. 280, 293 S.W.2d 251, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 167 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

      <p>
       A guardian ad litem cannot file a bill to sell land for benefit of an infant. Browning v. Browning, 79 Tenn. 106, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1883).

        6. Application by Next Friend.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In proceedings to sell land of allegedly mentally incompetent person in the interest of the incompetent, petition of next friend seeking to intervene was properly dismissed where the alleged incompetent was already represented by a guardian ad litem and the petition of the next friend disclosed that she was not acting exclusively in the interest of the alleged incompetent. Goins v. Yowell, 41 Tenn. App. 280, 293 S.W.2d 251, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 167 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A collateral attack on a proceeding in a suit to sell realty because not in accordance with the provisions of this section was not sustained. Covington v. Bullefin, 1 Tenn. App. 603, — S.W. —, 1925 Tenn. App. LEXIS 80 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceedings by administrator of estate for partition and sale of land for payment of debts of estate and also in interest of allegedly incompetent co-owner, degree of chancery court approving the sale would not be void so as to be subject to attack by creditor of estate on ground that bill was multifarious or subject to criticism for other technical grounds. Goins v. Yowell, 41 Tenn. App. 280, 293 S.W.2d 251, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 167 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

        8. Validity of Sale.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Even if this section should require that a suit in chancery for the sale of the property of an incompetent be instituted by a general guardian, a sale made at the insistence of someone other than the guardian would not be void. Goins v. Yowell, 41 Tenn. App. 280, 293 S.W.2d 251, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 167 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

       In a conservatorship proceeding where the brother-in-law sought to be appointed conservator over the elderly widow, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the appellate court presumed that the petition was served upon the widow and that the trial court clerk notified the widow's closest relatives as required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c01s34-1-106" target="_self">34-1-106</a></cite>.

       The jurisdiction of the county court (now juvenile or probate court) over infants and their estates, and over the appointment and removal of guardians, although general, is purely statutory. Lake v. McDavitt, 81 Tenn. 26, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to appoint guardians, require renewal of their bonds, remove them and appoint successors, and require annual reports or settlements, devolves upon the county court (now juvenile or probate court), the duty of the county clerk to give certain notices to guardians and to call the court's attention thereto being merely ministerial. Brown v. Brown, 16 Tenn. App. 230, 64 S.W.2d 59, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 6 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

       The chancery jurisdiction extends to the case of the person of the infant so far as necessary for his protection and education, and to the care of the property of the infant for its due management and preservation, and proper application for his maintenance. Lake v. McDavitt, 81 Tenn. 26, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to its statutory jurisdiction, the chancery court possesses its common law jurisdiction over infants and their estates, and may take control of an infant's property, and, in the absence of a general guardian, appoint a limited guardian of the person or estate of the infant, or a custodian or receiver of the property.

       Court did not abuse its discretion in appointing father of deceased as guardian for minor children of deceased in preference to surviving spouse of deceased who had remarried, though surviving spouse was named executrix of will. Massingale v. Hale, 5 Tenn. 30 (1817).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the appointment of the guardian is upon condition that he execute a bond, with good security, in a penalty fixed by the court, on or by a given time, is a good appointment, if there is found, among the files of guardian bonds, a formal guardian bond, corresponding with the entry on the record, and other records are produced showing several settlements subsequently made between the court and the appointee in his character of guardian.

      <p>
       Where the infant's estate is so large that no one can be procured to make the statutory bond, and become guardian, the chancery court may assume the custody and control of the persons and estates of infants, by the appointment of a special guardian to act under the instructions of the court and to be subject to its orders; and, in such case, it may fix the penalty of the bond at a less sum than the statutory bond would be. Such special guardian shall act until the appointment and qualification of a regular guardian. Lake v. McDavitt, 81 Tenn. 26, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a general guardian is appointed after appointment of a special guardian, the former will be entitled to demand and receive the property of the ward from the chancery court, or its special appointee, because a general or regular guardian under the statutory bond is always to be preferred to a special and limited guardian.

       Where the executor is appointed testamentary trustee of the entire estate of the testator's minor children, and is honest and capable, and has faithfully performed for them all the duties of guardian, without having qualified as their guardian, the chancery court will not remove him, and will not appoint a guardian for the custody of the persons of the infants, if such trustee is willing to continue to act as guardian in connection with the office of trustee.

       When a daughter sought appointment as the daughter's mother's conservator, it was not error to order the daughter to pay the fees and costs of the mother's guardian ad litem because T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c01s34-1-114" target="_self">34-1-114</a></cite> clearly granted the court such discretion.

       Conservator was appointed for the ward, but the spouse was not the petitioner, and thus she was not entitled to recover her attorney fees. In re King, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 638 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 6, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       One fee award against a ward's children was not an abuse of discretion because (1) the award had a statutory basis, and (2) the children did not show the award was void or extraordinary circumstances justifying relief existed. In re Conservatorship Campbell, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 727 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fee awards were final for appeal because (1) the awards were probate orders, (2) each resolved a specific claim, (3) the awards were not temporary, (4) no review was pending in the trial court, aside from a motion to set the awards aside, and (5) contempt proceedings based on the same acts did not defeat finality. In re Conservatorship Campbell, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 727 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two fee awards against a ward's children were void because the awards violated due process, as (1) the children were given only one day's electronic and regular mail notice of a hearing on the awards, (2) the children resided out of state, and (3) the children were unrepresented. In re Conservatorship Campbell, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 727 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate court erred in denying a motion to set aside fee awards as to two awards because the court should have viewed the motion as a motion to set aside a void judgment since the awards were final, to the extent the awards were alleged to be void for lack of notice. In re Conservatorship Campbell, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 727 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand was necessary because the conservatorship court improperly transferred to the probate court motions for attorney's fees without making necessary findings of fact and improperly closed the conservatorship without making findings of fact concerning the objections to the final accounting.

       In a conservatorship action in which an attorney ad litem was appointed to represent respondent, the trial court correctly held it did not have discretion to charge any portion of the attorney ad litem's fees to any party but respondent because the legislature removed the mandate concerning the fees of guardians ad litem under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c01s34-1-114ol1a" target="_self">34-1-114(a)</a></cite>, but not attorneys ad litem.

     </h3>
     <ol class="alpha">
      <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1a">
       A fiduciary is limited in its investments to the investments permitted by title 35, chapter 3 unless estate funds or property, or both, are transferred to a trust created pursuant to the Tennessee Uniform Trust Code, compiled in title 35, chapter 15. All funds held by a fiduciary shall be invested within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the funds unless otherwise allowed by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1b">
       Except as provided in subsection (d), at the hearing for the appointment of a fiduciary, the proposed fiduciary shall present an outline of the proposed property management plan for the respondent's property. If the proposed property management plan cannot be presented at the appointment hearing, the fiduciary shall submit the proposed property management plan to the court for approval before any property is invested. The purpose of the property management plan is to advise the court of the general type of property in which the respondent's property will be invested so the court will be assured the fiduciary will be making approved investments. The plan need not detail the individual asset or assets. For example, if the fiduciary plans to invest in certificates of deposit, the plan need only make that statement. It is not necessary to identify the individual institution or institutions whose certificates will be purchased.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1c">
       Except as provided in subsections (d) and (f), each fiduciary shall request court approval to change the nature of the fiduciary's investment or investments. Compliance with the preceding sentence does not require court approval to change the same type of investment from one institution to another. For example, changing a certificate of deposit from one institution to another does not require court approval. Changing from one type of investment to another does require court approval. For example, changing from a certificate of deposit to traded stock would require court approval. If the fiduciary's property management plan describes proposed changes the fiduciary would make in response to economic and market conditions, the court may grant advance approval to make changes as described in the plan.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1d">
       If the fiduciary is a financial institution, it shall not be required to seek court approval to change any investment.

       <ol>
        <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1e1">
         Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, no property management plan shall be required for the property of a minor or person with a disability if such property does not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in value, unless, on the motion of any interested party, including the guardian ad litem, the court finds such plan would be in the best interest of such minor or person with a disability.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1e2">
         If no plan is filed pursuant to subdivision (e)(1), the fiduciary's first accounting and all subsequent accountings shall state how the funds of the estate are invested and how the fiduciary proposes that the funds will be invested for the coming year.

         A fiduciary may petition the court to waive the requirement to request court approval to change the nature of any investment described in the property management plan as required by subsection (c). The waiver shall be within the court's sole discretion, and the court may revoke the waiver at any time. In deciding upon the waiver, the court may consider the fiduciary's history as a conservator, the length of conservatorship, the number of years the fiduciary has acted as a conservator, and any other factors that the court deems proper. The court may require the conservator to obtain professional advice or assistance regarding the investment of excess funds.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1f2">
         The court may approve the waiver request at a hearing for which all of the respondent's heirs at law or beneficiaries had notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the proposed waiver and change of the nature of the fiduciary's investments.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1f3">
         If a waiver is approved by the court, the waiver shall be reduced to a written order. The fiduciary shall at all times maintain a minimum balance of funds sufficient to cover anticipated costs of care of the respondent for a minimum of three (3) years.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1f4">
         If a waiver is approved by the court, the fiduciary shall provide, in the accounting report required by § 34-1-111(b), a detailed outline of the investments made on behalf of the respondent and the current status of those investments. The purpose of the report is to assure the court that:
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t34c01s34-1-115ol1f4A">

       If funds are transferred to a trust as referenced in subsection (a), the fiduciary and trust protector are relieved of requirements under this title where trust assets, investments, and their financial nature require public disclosure or filing upon public record. A certification of trust outlined under § 35-15-1013 may be filed with the clerk of the court to show such trust is created. Such trust must be governed and administered by a qualified trustee as permitted by title 35. Further, the court clerk with personal jurisdiction over the person with a disability or minor must be named trust protector of said trust with powers prescribed by §§ 35-15-1201 — 35-15-1206.

If appointed, the court shall define in the order of appointment the circumstances under which the standby fiduciary shall become an active fiduciary and the actions that the standby fiduciary shall take to notify the court of the need for the standby fiduciary to become active. If the court determines there is a need for an active fiduciary, the court shall issue an order authorizing the standby fiduciary to function which order shall contain such other authority or restriction, consistent with this chapter, and chapters 2 and 3 of this title, as the court determines is in the best interest of the minor or person with a disability. In considering a petition for the appointment of a standby fiduciary, the court shall try to minimize the costs to the petitioner to the extent the court determines it is in the best interest of the minor or the person with a potential disability.

       Trial court properly granted the Tennessee Department of Correction (TDOC) a limited conservatorship over an inmate and the authority to consent to forcible treatment on his behalf because the order was the least restrictive means of furthering TDOC's compelling interest; assuming the imposition of a limited conservatorship was governed by Tenn. Const. art. I, § 13, the practice was not unnecessary because there was significant evidence it was necessary to treat serious mental health issues. State Dep't of Corr. v. Todd, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 223 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2017), review denied and ordered not published, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 518 (Tenn. Aug. 17, 2017).

       Trial court properly granted the Tennessee Department of Correction a limited conservatorship over an inmate and the authority to consent to forcible treatment on his behalf because the inmate suffered from a mental illness and experienced significant mental health issues that were ameliorated by appropriate treatment; due to the lack of a transcript, the record on appeal contained no evidence of the actual side effects the inmate experienced or that he was likely to experience.

       Order of financial guardianship entered by the juvenile court was not void on its face and could not be attacked in a collateral proceeding, despite the order's errors and irregularities, because venue was properly established, the juvenile court was a “court of record,” and the orders corresponded with the petitions filed by a minor's half-sister requesting her appointment as guardian; an insurer was entitled to rely upon the juvenile court's facially valid order authorizing disbursement of proceeds.

       Chancery court had jurisdiction to make a finding whether it was in the best interest of a minor child to be returned to the child's home country of Guatemala, and the petition by the child's uncle for the appointment of a guardian for the child specifically requested a finding as to the issue. Therefore, as the chancery court mistakenly found that it did not have jurisdiction, remand of the case to the court for the court to make a determination of whether it was in the child's best interest to be returned to Guatemala was appropriate.

       An action challenging the constitutionality of conservatorship laws was within the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine and the case did not become moot when the conservatorship involved was dissolved.

       The word “friend” need not be construed as a social acquaintance or constant companion, but it may also embrace one who befriends or acts “in the interests” of the affected person; the comparable expression in the former kindred Limited Guardianship Act is “any interested person” found in former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c04s34-4-104" target="_self">34-4-104</a></cite> [repealed; see now § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c03s34-3-102" target="_self">34-3-102</a></cite>].

       The language that the petition may be brought by “one or more of his friends or relatives” is understandably broad because the paramount concern is the welfare of the allegedly incapacitated individual. In re Rockwell, 673 S.W.2d 512, 1983 Tenn. App. LEXIS 687 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The very simple statutory procedure for contesting incompetency by the ward of a conservatorship affords adequate procedural due process and the statutes do not unjustifiably restrict a ward's liberty in violation of substantive due process or the right to equal protection. State ex rel. McCormick v. Burson, 894 S.W.2d 739, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 622 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “county of residence” means the county of the disabled person's legal residence or domicile and Tennessee courts cannot exercise personal jurisdiction in proceedings to appoint a conservator over disabled persons who just happen to be within their territorial jurisdiction.

       State conservatorship statutes do not run afoul of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act since state action under such laws does not discriminate against wards in the context of the federal statute.

       Trial court was correct in dismissing a daughter's petition seeking the appointment of a conservator for her mother because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the mother, who was domiciled in California; the mother was a domiciliary of California and not Roane County, Tennessee, and when she left California and took up residence with the daughter she did not have the requisite intent either to abandon the old domicile or to acquire a new one; In re Proposed Conservatorship of Mary F.

       Where a comatose veteran's wife was appointed conservator of the estate and person of her husband, the trial court erred in denying her an appropriate hearing on her petition to remove a bank as co-conservator and to retain control over the medical malpractice litigation that she had filed on behalf of her husband in federal court.

       Order did give the conservator the authority to “do any other act of legal significance which the trial court, at any time in the future, might have deemed necessary or advisable”; that “catch-all” provision included the filing and maintaining of an annulment action, as such an action was clearly an “act of legal significance.” Nave v.

If no objections have been filed to the clerk's report on the preliminary final accounting within thirty (30) days from the date the clerk's report is filed, the conservator shall distribute the remaining assets.

     <p>
      The appointment of a conservator for a person with a disability does not automatically terminate the duty of the person with a disability to support such spouse or dependent minor children of the person with a disability. The court having jurisdiction over the person with a disability may establish the amount of financial support to which the spouse or dependent minor children are entitled.

The person whose commitment is sought shall be personally served with notice of the pending commitment proceeding in the manner as provided by the law of this state, and nothing in this chapter shall affect the person's right to appear and be heard in the proceedings.

       An attorney in fact is in a fiduciary relationship with the principal, but only to the extent that the attorney in fact undertakes to act under the power of attorney.

        In a will contest, a court erred by providing the jury with a checklist of powers needed to create an “unrestricted” power of attorney and a confidential relationship because the jury was misled as to how a confidential relationship could be created by a power of attorney. Therefore, the presumption of undue influence could not have been raised, causing the burden to shift to defendants to prove the fairness of the transactions by clear and convincing evidence.

        Evidence did not preponderate against the findings that defendant improperly converted his mother's funds for his own benefit and he failed to prove that the money at issue represented gifts under the power of attorney; after her stroke, the mother never returned to her home and was unable to enjoy the benefit of any of the improvements made to her property by defendant, and it stretched credibility to think that the mother intended to gift money to defendant to use in the manner in which he did when that money could have been used to provide for the mother's immediate physical care and comfort after she suffered the stroke.

       <p>
        If a person other than the principal prepares a durable power of attorney for health care for the principal, the document shall contain the following warning statement. The failure to include the warning statement in the document shall not affect the validity of the document:
       </p>
       <p>
        WARNING TO PERSON EXECUTING THIS DOCUMENT
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an important legal document. Before executing this document you should know these important facts.
       </p>
       <p>
        This document gives the person you designate as your agent (the attorney in fact) the power to make health care decisions for you. Your agent must act consistently with your desires as stated in this document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except as you otherwise specify in this document, this document gives your agent the power to consent to your doctor not giving treatment or stopping treatment necessary to keep you alive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding this document, you have the right to make medical and other health care decisions for yourself so long as you can give informed consent with respect to the particular decision. In addition, no treatment may be given to you over your objection, and health care necessary to keep you alive may not be stopped or withheld if you object at the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This document gives your agent authority to consent, to refuse to consent, or to withdraw consent to any care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose or treat a physical or mental condition. This power is subject to any limitations that you include in this document. You may state in this document any types of treatment that you do not desire. In addition, a court can take away the power of your agent to make health care decisions for you if your agent: (1) authorizes anything that is illegal; or (2) acts contrary to your desires as stated in this document.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have the right to revoke the authority of your agent by notifying your agent or your treating physician, hospital or other health care provider orally or in writing of the revocation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your agent has the right to examine your medical records and to consent to their disclosure unless you limit this right in this document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless you otherwise specify in this document, this document gives your agent the power after you die to: (1) authorize an autopsy; (2) donate your body or parts thereof for transplant or therapeutic or educational or scientific purposes; and (3) direct the disposition of your remains.
       </p>
       <p>
        If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask an attorney to explain it to you.

       The general assembly recognizes that many elderly persons in the state are unable to meet essential requirements for their physical health or to manage essential aspects of their financial resources. The general assembly finds that private conservatorship is inadequate where there are no willing and responsible family members or friends to serve as conservator and where the disabled person does not have adequate resources for the compensation of a private conservator, or to pay legal and court costs. The general assembly intends through this chapter to establish a statewide public conservatorship program to aid disabled persons who are sixty (60) years of age or older who have no family member or friend who is willing and able to serve as conservator.

       The general assembly intends to promote the general welfare by establishing a public guardianship system that permits the disabled elderly to determinatively participate as fully as possible in all decisions that affect them, that assists such persons to regain or develop their capacities to the maximum extent possible, and that accomplishes such objectives through the use of the least intrusive alternatives. This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish these purposes. It is the intent of the general assembly that nothing contained in this chapter will affect the powers of the court under chapters 1, 2 and 3 of this title, nor create additional powers not contained in chapters 1, 2 and 3 of this title. The district public guardian shall not serve in more than one (1) capacity in any one (1) proceeding under chapters 1, 2 and 3 of this title.

Notwithstanding the appointment of a guardian or conservator under this part, or under this title or any other provision of law, nothing in this title shall supersede the provisions of the Act, providing for the protection of vulnerable adults in need of protective services as defined in the Act, the authority of the department of human services under the Act to investigate cases of an adult who may be in need of protective services and to provide such services, or the jurisdiction of the court under the Act to order the provision of protective services or the establishment of a temporary guardian appointed by the court to secure and disburse the adult's property to fund such services. The court's orders under the Act shall supersede and suspend any orders entered under this title or any other law that addresses the protection, custody, including emergency temporary custody, of the adult or the disposition of property necessary to fund protective services for the adult under the Act; provided, however, that the ultimate determination of the jurisdiction of this state or another state or foreign country to enter orders for the adult's personal protection and financial welfare shall be determined under the jurisdictional provisions of this part.
