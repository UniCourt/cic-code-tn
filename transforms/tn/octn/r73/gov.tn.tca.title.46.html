        The lands acquired for cemetery purposes, by a cemetery company incorporated under the general laws of this state, are thereby dedicated to a public use. Memphis S. L. R. Co. v. Forest Hill Cemetery Co., 116 Tenn. 400, 94 S.W. 69, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        The public purpose to which cemetery lands are dedicated is not defeated, and the use rendered a private one, by the fact that the incorporators may realize a profit out of the enterprise, nor because the charter or the law does not fix the price at which burial lots are to be sold.

        Cemetery companies must sell to all who may apply “the same measure of accommodation for the same measure of money.” The power conferred by the charter upon the board of directors to sell the lots “in such manner” as they may determine has reference to the modes and terms of payment, the taking of securities therefor, and the like, and not to the persons to whom they shall sell.

        The statutory power to mortgage in the charter of a cemetery company does not negate an intention that its property shall be devoted to public use, for the nature of the rights secured by the law and charter to lot owners is such as to forbid the mortgaging of anything except that part of the proceeds of lots sold which is not devoted to the maintenance and improvement of the cemetery.

         Acts 1927, ch. 75, formerly compiled in this section, which required cemetery to maintain an improvement fund by setting aside 25 percent of sums already paid to cemetery prior to enactment of law, was held to be unconstitutional in toto, as the valid parts of the act could not be saved by the application of the doctrine of elision. The object expressed in §§ 7, 9 and 10 of the act to penalize cemetery officers, directors and stockholders for the acts and omissions of their predecessors, and to expropriate the substance of officers, directors and stockholders to corporate uses, violated Tenn. Const., art. I, §§ 8, 20. Spring Hill Cem. v. Lindsey, 162 Tenn. 420, 37 S.W.2d 111, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1931).

         Contracts with purchasers of cemetery lots under cemetery corporation providing for the setting aside of 25 (25%) percent of the sale price for perpetual maintenance and care merely imposed a contract duty to create the fund and did not directly establish a trust.

   T.C.A. § 54-7- 202 does not necessarily prohibit a county from repairing or maintaining roads in such a county if the roads lead to a cemetery and are available for public. It only prohibits the use of nonmonetary county resources for anything other than official county road purposes, subject to statutory exceptions. if a road qualifies as part of a dilapidated or abandoned cemetery, the county would be permitted to solicit, receive, and use funds to rehabilitate and maintain the cemetery, including any road that is a portion of the cemetery. However, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t46c02s46-2-107" target="_self">46-2-107</a></cite> does not abrogate T.C.A.. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.54.html#t54c07s54-7-202" target="_blank">54-7-202</a></cite>’s prohibition on county officers and county employees from using any county vehicle, equipment, supplies, or road materials for non-official county road purposes. Accordingly, while a county may use those funds solicited and received for the purpose of rehabilitating a cemetery, it may not use its own nonmonetary resources, even if reimbursed with the funds received. Neither T.C. A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t46c02s46-2-107" target="_self">46-2-107</a></cite> nor §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.54.html#t54c07s54-7-202" target="_blank">54-7-202</a></cite> prohibits a county from contracting with a private contractor to repair and preserve these roads as long as the county has the authority to use its funds to repair and preserve the road in question.
