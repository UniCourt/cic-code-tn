         The general assembly finds that in order to maintain and enhance the purposes, programs and functions of the state park system, including, but not limited to, educational, interpretative and recreational functions, nonprofit citizen support organizations may be organized, and the commissioner of environment and conservation, after approval of the commissioner of finance and administration, may enter into agreements with such organizations for the purpose of providing support, financial and otherwise, to a specific park or parks, or the state park system. The agreement shall be forwarded to the comptroller of the treasury for review and comment prior to the execution by any state official. It is the intent of this legislation that any revenues generated by these organizations be used to enhance the state parks and their programs. To that end, it is the intent that state appropriations to the parks not be reduced when revenues are generated by these organizations.

       The general assembly recognizes that the forests of Tennessee are a valuable natural resource that provide significant economic and social benefits to the citizens of the state. It is further recognized that efforts are needed to effectively protect and develop those forests in a manner that assures the perpetuation of long-term public benefits. In response to such needs, the general assembly has created the Tennessee Forestry Act. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a state forestry organization that is responsible for the development and administration of those programs and services that ensure effective protection, management, and reforestation of Tennessee's forests.

          </p>
          <p>
           Article I.
          </p>
          <p>
           The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the southeastern region of the United States by the development of integrated forest fire plans, by the maintenance of adequate forest firefighting services by the member states, by providing for mutual aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting states of the region and with states which are party to other regional forest fire protection compacts or agreements, and for more adequate forest protection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Article II.
          </p>
          <p>
           This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states ratifying it whenever any two (2) or more of the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia which are contiguous have ratified it and congress has given consent thereto. Any state not mentioned in this article which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.
          </p>
          <p>
           Article III.
          </p>
          <p>
           In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control shall act as compact administrator for that state and shall consult with like officials of the other member states and shall implement cooperation between such states in forest fire prevention and control.
          </p>
          <p>
           The compact administrators of the member states shall coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.
          </p>
          <p>
           There shall be established an advisory committee of legislators, forestry commission representatives, and forestry or forest products industries representatives which shall meet from time to time with the compact administrators. Each member state shall name one (1) member of the senate and one (1) member of the house of representatives who shall be designated by that state's commission on interstate cooperation, or if the commission cannot constitutionally designate the members, they shall be designated in accordance with the laws of that state; and the governor of each member state shall appoint two (2) representatives, one (1) of whom shall be associated with forestry or forest products industries, to comprise the membership of the advisory committee. Action shall be taken by a majority of the compacting states, and each state shall be entitled to one (1) vote.
          </p>
          <p>
           The compact administrators shall formulate and, in accordance with need, from time to time, revise a regional forest fire plan for the member states.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is the duty of each member state to formulate and put in effect a forest fire plan for that state and take such measures as may be necessary to integrate such forest fire plan with the regional forest fire plan formulated by the compact administrators.
          </p>
          <p>
           Article IV.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whenever the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests aid from the state forest fire control agency of any other member state in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires, it is the duty of the state forest fire control agency of that state to render all possible aid to the requesting agency which is consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.
          </p>
          <p>
           Article V.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whenever the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member state under this compact, the employees of such state shall, under the direction of the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are rendering aid.
          </p>
          <p>
           No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance, or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as relieving any person from liability for such person's own negligent act or omission, or as imposing liability for such negligent act or omission upon any state.
          </p>
          <p>
           All liability, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, that may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.
          </p>
          <p>
           Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in, the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and subsistence of employees and maintenance of equipment incurred in connection with such request; provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any assisting member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such service to the receiving member state without charge or cost.
          </p>
          <p>
           Each member state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured employees and the representatives of deceased employees in case employees sustain injuries or are killed while rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the purposes of this compact, “employee” includes any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state under the laws thereof.
          </p>
          <p>
           The compact administrators shall formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in accordance with the laws of the member states.
          </p>
          <p>
           Article VI.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ratification of this compact shall not be construed to affect any existing statute so as to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of the forest firefighting forces, equipment, services or facilities of any member state.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or restrict the powers of any state ratifying the same to provide for the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or enforcement of state laws, rules or regulations intended to aid in such prevention, control and extinguishment in such state.

      </li>
      <li id="t11c13s11-13-101ol1b">
       The general assembly finds that certain rivers of Tennessee possess outstanding scenic, recreational, geological, fish and wildlife, botanical, historical, archaeological and other scientific and cultural values of great present and future benefit to the people. The general assembly further finds that the policy that has resulted in dam and other construction on many of the rivers of Tennessee needs to be complemented by a policy that would preserve other valuable selected rivers or sections thereof in their free-flowing natural or scenic condition and protect their water quality and adjacent lands. It is the policy of the general assembly to preserve and, if necessary, reclaim for the benefit of the people selected parts of Tennessee's diminishing resources of free-flowing rivers. It is the policy of the general assembly to maintain a proper balance between reservoirs and free-flowing rivers, to provide, thereby, a desirable variety of scenic, recreational, scientific and other values. It is the policy of the general assembly to preserve, within the scenic river system itself, several different types and examples of river areas, including the mountain streams and deep gorges of east Tennessee, the pastoral rivers of middle Tennessee and the swamp and wildfowl rivers of west Tennessee. For aesthetic as well as ecological and other scientific reasons, priority and especial emphasis shall be given to the preservation of natural, unspoiled, undeveloped river areas. Few of these are left in the eastern United States and the general assembly feels a strong obligation to the American people to protect the remarkably beautiful ones in Tennessee. The general assembly affirms that it must not deny the people of this generation and their descendants the opportunity to refresh their spirits with the infinite beauties of the unspoiled stream. To implement these policies, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish a state scenic rivers system by designating certain scenic river areas for immediate inclusion in the system and by prescribing the procedures and criteria for protecting and administering the system and for adding new components to it. It is not the intent of this chapter to require or to authorize acquisition of all lands within the exterior boundaries of scenic river areas but to assure preservation of the scenic, ecological and other values, and to provide proper management of the recreational, wildlife and other land and water resources. It is the intention of the general assembly that in all planning for the use and development of water and related land resources, consideration shall be given by all local, state and federal agencies involved to potential scenic river areas, and all river basin and project plan reports should discuss any such potential.

     <p>
      The following types of rivers are eligible for inclusion in the state scenic rivers system in which they will be administered in general accord with the criteria hereinafter set forth:
     </p>
     <p>
      Classes of Scenic River Areas
     </p>
     <p>
      Class I Natural river areas
     </p>
     <p>
      Class II Pastoral river areas
     </p>
     <p>
      Class III Partially developed river areas (1) Class I Natural River Areas
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
   Those free-flowing rivers or sections of rivers with shorelines and scenic vistas unchanged, or essentially unchanged, by man, with no extensive paralleling roads closer than one (1) mile (except in river gorges where there must be no extensive paralleling roads within the gorge or within one-quarter (¼) mile back from the gorge rim), and with only a limited number of crossing roads or spur roads existing at the time of designation as a state scenic river. Additional access would be limited to trails. Waters would be kept unpolluted. Lands adjacent to these rivers that are not already in state or other public ownership should be protected by acquisition of fee title or by conservation easements to the full extent necessary to preserve a true natural environment. These river areas should be managed in accordance with the concepts embodied in the national Wilderness Act, 78 Stat. 890 (<cite class="us_code">16 U.S.C. § 1131</cite> et seq.), and would represent samples of natural America saved unspoiled for this and future generations to enjoy as precious pieces of our natural heritage. (2) Class II Pastoral River Areas
     </p>
     <p>
      Those free-flowing rivers or sections of rivers the lands adjacent to which are partially or predominantly used for agriculture and other dispersed human activities which do not substantially interfere with public use and enjoyment of the rivers and their shores. Waters would be kept unpolluted. Lands adjacent to any such river would remain primarily in the type of use existing at the time of designation as a state scenic river or else be allowed to revert to natural conditions. Scenic values should be preserved by acquisition of conservation easements, zoning and similar means, and by acquisition of fee title of areas set aside for access, camping and recreation. Acquisition of fee title or other areas would not be precluded, particularly where the cost of alternative methods of land use control is comparable to the cost of acquiring the fee with lease-back or other similar arrangements. (3) Class III Partially Developed River Areas
     </p>
     <p>
      Those rivers or sections of rivers in areas affected by the works of man, but which still possess actual or potential scenic values. Included would be rivers with some housing or other building developments near their shorelines, rivers with parallel roads or railroads, rivers with some impoundments, and rivers polluted, for example, by strip-mine runoff. These rivers would be managed to prevent further loss of scenic values, to improve the scenic aspects of their surroundings, and to restore the quality of their waters. A polluted river section in an otherwise natural area could be improved to the point where it would be upgraded to Class I. Lands adjacent to any such river, and the use thereof, should be subject to public control by zoning, tax incentives, acquisition of easements or fee title and other means sufficient to realize the purposes for which such river is designated a state scenic river.

       The general assembly finds that in the countryside of Tennessee there are areas possessing scenic, scientific, including biological, geological and/or recreational values, and which are in prospect and peril of being destroyed or substantially diminished by actions such as dumping of refuse, commercialization, construction, changing of population densities or similar actions, there being either no regulations by the state or by local governments or regulations which are inadequate or so poorly enforced as not to yield adequate protection to such areas. It is the intention of the general assembly to provide protection for such areas.

           On or before January 1 of each year, the commissioner of general services shall certify to the comptroller of the treasury such information as is necessary to identify the parcels of property that have been rendered tax exempt pursuant to this part during the prior fiscal year. The comptroller of the treasury shall determine the appropriate tax rate and assessed value of every parcel of property acquired by the wildlife resources agency regardless of whether the land was acquired with wetlands funds, and, on or before March 1 of each year, shall certify to the commissioner of finance and administration the amount of property tax revenue lost by each affected city or county the prior fiscal year. The assessed value shall be based on the use value provided for in title 67, chapter 5, part 10, if the property is of sufficient size to have been classified under that part. Acquisition pursuant to this part of property classified under title 67, chapter 5, part 10, shall not constitute a change in the use of the property, and no rollback taxes shall become due solely as a result of such acquisition. If the property is not of sufficient size to have been classified under title 67, chapter 5, part 10, the assessed value shall be determined according to the same basis as other like property within the jurisdiction. Each subsequent yearly reimbursement amount shall be based on the same assessed value, tax rate and use in effect on the date of purchase. The commissioner of finance and administration shall reimburse each affected city and county the amount so determined from funds available in the compensation fund. In any year in which funds available in the compensation fund are insufficient to fully reimburse such cities and counties, the commissioner of finance and administration shall effect a transfer of funds from the 1986 Wetland Acquisition Fund to the compensation fund in an amount sufficient to fully reimburse the affected cities and counties. Funds transferred from the 1986 Wetland Acquisition Fund to the compensation fund along with interest, if any, accruing on such funds after their transfer to the compensation fund, shall be expended to reimburse affected cities and counties only for lands purchased under the U.A. Moore Wetlands Acquisition Act.

      In order to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the state of Tennessee, acting through any of its departments, agencies, or institutions, subject, in the case of the state, to the approval of the state building commission or any other public body, may acquire interests in real property in the form of scenic easements. Acquisition of interests in land or in structures (scenic easements) may be by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or otherwise, but not by exercise of the power of eminent domain. However, no interests in land or in structures (scenic easement) may be acquired except to assist in the protection and preservation of those historic, architectural, archaeological or cultural resources listed in the National Register or Tennessee Register or those natural areas that are included among the park or recreational lands administered by the public body. In addition, any public body may designate a scenic easement in any real property in which it has an interest in order to provide protection to and assist in the preservation of such listed and designated resources and areas.

       The purposes of this chapter are to create a county conservation board and to authorize counties to acquire, develop, maintain, and make available to the inhabitants of the county, public parks, preserves, parkways, playgrounds, recreational centers, county forests, wildlife areas and other conservation areas, and to promote and preserve the health and general welfare of the people, to encourage the orderly development and conservation of natural resources, and to cultivate good citizenship by providing adequate programs of public recreation.

        Upon petition of not less than two hundred (200) qualified voters in any county to the county legislative body thereof, the county legislative body shall submit to the people of the county at the next general county-wide election the question of whether a county conservation board shall be created as provided for in this chapter. If at the election the majority of votes polled are for the creation of a county conservation board, the county legislative body shall within sixty (60) days after the election, create a county conservation board. In the alternative, the county legislative body in any county may, by a majority of all its members, also create a county conservation board in that county, as provided for in this chapter, without petition and referendum. As a further alternative, any county having a population of more than two hundred eighty-seven thousand (287,000) according to the 1980 federal census may, by a majority vote of all the members of the county legislative body, adopt chapter 24 of this title, for the effective management of a parks and recreation department. Furthermore, these alternative provisions relating to counties of populations greater than two hundred eighty-seven thousand (287,000) and to chapter 24 of this title shall have no effect unless the county legislative body approves by a two-thirds (2/3) vote a resolution accepting as applicable these provisions. Approval or nonapproval of such resolution shall be proclaimed by the presiding officer of the legislative body, and certified by the presiding officer to the secretary of state.

        If created by any of these three (3) methods, the board shall consist of a minimum of five (5) bona fide residents up to a maximum of nine (9) bona fide residents of such county. The members shall hold office for staggered terms, not to exceed five (5) years, as indicated and fixed by the county legislative body. When any member of the board, during the term of office, shall cease to be a bona fide resident of the county, such member shall thereby be disqualified as a member of the board and such member's office shall thereupon be declared vacant. Members of the board shall be selected and appointed on the basis of their demonstrated interest in conservation matters and shall serve without compensation, but may be paid their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. All reimbursement for travel expenses shall be in accordance with the comprehensive travel regulations as promulgated by the department of finance and administration and approved by the attorney general and reporter.

The board shall have power to adopt bylaws, to adopt and use a common seal, and to enter into contracts. The county legislative body shall provide suitable offices for the meetings of the board and for the safekeeping of its records. Such records shall be subject to public inspection at all reasonable hours and under such regulations as the board may prescribe. The board shall annually make a full and complete report to the county legislative body of its transactions and operations for the preceding year. Such report shall contain a full statement of its receipts, disbursements, and the program of work for the period covered, and may include such recommendations as may be deemed advisable.

        <li id="t11c25s11-25-102ol1a1">
         There is an immediate need to conserve Doe Mountain, an iconic eight thousand six hundred (8,600) acre forested mountain presently under threat from economic distress;

        <li id="t11c25s11-25-102ol1a3">
         The conservation of Doe Mountain and the proper development of multi-use recreational opportunities on the mountain requires partnerships between state and local government, the private sector, conservationists, and an engaged local community to preserve the mountain's unique nature and realize its economic potential;

        <li id="t11c25s11-25-102ol1a4">
         In many instances, effective cooperation between these parties has been hampered by inadequate statutory authority and management expertise. An authority vested with the full range of necessary statutory powers is, therefore, needed to ensure the success of Doe Mountain's conservation and to realize its full economic potential for the citizens of this state; and

         Realizing that the economic development potential of newly acquired conservation lands calls for a new mechanism to manage these lands for multi-use outdoor recreation opportunities and to make the public aware of these opportunities, the general assembly, therefore, intends to vest an authority with the powers set forth herein to prepare comprehensive, long-range, site-specific master plans and to ensure compliance with such plans; to conserve the land, waters, and wildlife of Doe Mountain in a manner protective of the resource, including, where applicable, transfer of lands management for natural areas and/or wildlife management areas; and to foster economic development for the people by the development and operation of multi-use, family-oriented outdoor recreation opportunities.
