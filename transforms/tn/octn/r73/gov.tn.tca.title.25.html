       It is not wrong in the declaration to claim the penalty of the bond sued on, for this is agreeable to this statute, which directs judgment to be entered for the penalty to be discharged by the damages assessed. Calhoun v. Lillard, 5 Tenn. 56, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 47 (1817).

       Interest cannot properly be allowed on the penalty of a fidelity bond, prior to the judgment in the lower court, where the bond expresses only a maximum amount of liability, dependent upon the breach of duty by the employee whose conduct was insured, and the exact amount of liability is measured by the extent of the breach, for such bond is one with collateral conditions. Interest may be allowed only after judgment on the bond. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 125 Tenn. 658, 148 S.W. 671, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1911).

   Judgments of the same court, including the supreme court, may, upon motion, be setoff against each other, whether rendered at the same term or at different terms, but the costs belonging to other parties cannot be setoff. Hadley's Adm'rs v. Hickman, 9 Tenn. 501, 1831 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1831); Rutherford v. Crabb, 13 Tenn. 111, 13 Tenn. 112, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1833); Sneed v. Sneed, 82 Tenn. 13, 1884 Tenn.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where a judgment is attached or impounded for debt, and the lien is fixed on it, the equities then existing may be asserted by the judgment debtor, but not the equities thereafter created or existing. A judgment in tort, thereafter obtained by the judgment debtor against the judgment creditor, cannot be setoff against the judgment so attached. Harris v. Harris, 3 Shan. 57 (1878).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Insurance agencies' obligations to insurer to collect and remit premiums, and insurer's obligation to agencies for share of profit, were mutual, and thus could be offset in insolvent insurer's action against agencies for unpaid premiums. McReynolds v. Cherokee Ins. Co., 815 S.W.2d 201, 1990 Tenn. App. LEXIS 673 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).

      <p>
       The defendant in an action at law on a money demand may rely upon a judgment against the plaintiff as a setoff, whether the judgment was rendered in favor of defendant, or assigned to him before the commencement of the suit. Wilson v. Reaves, 36 Tenn. 173, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1856).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where the defendant had a plain and unembarrassed right of setoff against an action at law, and failed to present it, he cannot, after the judgment has been rendered against him, maintain a bill in chancery to have his claims setoff against such judgment. Crafton v. Boon, 52 Tenn. 93, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 239 (1871).

      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>
   The right to setoff independent judgments rendered in different suits, growing out of different causes of action, is subordinate to the attorney's lien for services rendered in obtaining the particular judgment. Roberts v. Mitchell, 94 Tenn. 277, 29 S.W. 5, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 44, <cite class="lra">29 L.R.A. 705</cite> (1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       An excess judgment for defendant, recovered by way of recoupment on one of two contracts which complainant sued on, may be setoff against complainant's judgment on the other, but such right is subordinate to lien for fees of complainant's solicitor on the judgment against which there was no recoupment. Mack v. Hugger Bros. Constr. Co., 10 Tenn. App. 402, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 47 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney's lien attaches as of date of filing bill of complaint in chancery. Mack v. Hugger Bros. Constr. Co., 10 Tenn. App. 402, — S.W.2d —, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 47 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1929).

   The right to setoff judgments against each other cannot be so exercised as to circumvent the exemption laws. Duff v. Wells, 54 Tenn. 17, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1871); Collier v.

       A suit may be joint upon the counts charging a confederacy, but several upon the other counts as to each defendant, and a several judgment may be rendered upon such counts. Renkert v. Elliott, 79 Tenn. 235, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1883).

       On a verdict for several damages against each defendant sued jointly in an action of tort, plaintiff may enter a judgment against one defendant for the amount returned against him, and dismiss the suit as to the other defendants. Davis v. Chance, 10 Tenn. 94, 1825 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1825); Nashville R.R. & Light Co. v. Trawick, 118 Tenn. 273, 99 S.W. 695, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 95, 10 L.R.A. (n.s.) 191 (1906).

       The fact that some of the defendants may successfully defend the suit by plea of the bar of the statutes of limitation will be no protection to the other defendants, against whom the suit was commenced in time, where the cause of action is joint and several.

       A plaintiff, who recovers in action against joint tort-feasors, is entitled to have his full damages adjudged in one sum against all of the defendants, although they may have been culpable in different degrees.

       In an action for the death of plaintiff's wife, where the jury first reported that they found in favor of plaintiff and assessed $5,000 damages against the railroad company, and $5,000 damages against the estate of the driver of the automobile, it was not error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that a joint verdict must be rendered, and, when the foreman, in response to questions, stated that the verdict was for plaintiff for $10,000, to enter judgment, on such verdict, especially where neither of defendants objected to such manner of receiving the verdict or request the jury to be polled.

       Trial court properly dismissed a wife's claim for loss of consortium as barred by the statute of limitations because the wife she was not a party to the patient's original health care liability complaint that was dismissed without prejudice; thus, the wife was unable to take advantage of the saving statute that was available to the patient, her husband.

       This section does not require notice to the principal, in order that he may have the principal, in order that he may have an opportunity to tender the indemnity. If no offer is made by the principal to defend and give counter security, the surety is not obliged to defend. The surety can confess judgment, if no such offer is made, for more than what is legally due, but he can only recover from his principal what is legally due. Williams v. Greer's Adm'rs, 5 Tenn. 235, 1817 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1817); Newnan v. Campbell, 8 Tenn. 63, 8 Tenn. 69, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1827).

       Where the makers of a note put in a plea of nil debit and payment, but the accommodation endorser put in no plea, and upon notice from the makers that they will ask leave to file pleas setting up usury in bar of the action, the plaintiff dismissed the suit as to the makers, and took judgment by default against the accommodation endorser whereupon, at the same term, he took judgment over by motion against one of the makers who thereupon filed a bill to enjoin the judgment of plaintiff against such endorser and the latter's judgment against himself, without alleging that he offered to indemnify such endorser or to make defense, or that there was a fraudulent combination between the payee and such endorser there is no equity in the bill.

       Where a court proceeds according to the course of the common law, all presumptions are in favor of the correctness of its action; but where it proceeds in a summary way, under a statutory authority, the record must show that the authority was strictly pursued. To make a judgment by motion valid, all material facts authorizing the exercise of the jurisdiction must affirmatively appear. Accordingly, the judgment must set forth a state of facts authorizing its rendition, and if any one of such facts be missing, the judgment will be void. Marshal v. Hill, 16 Tenn. 101, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1835); Scott v. Lanham, 16 Tenn. 420, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1835); Ferrel v. Finch, 16 Tenn. 432, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 99 (1835); Hubbard v. Cole, 17 Tenn. 502, 1836 Tenn.

      <p>
       In summary proceedings, as well before justices (now judges of the courts of general sessions) as before courts of record, every fact which is necessary to give the court jurisdiction and to authorize the judgment must be set out in the judgment as having been made to appear. Burt v. Davidson, 24 Tenn. 425, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 104 (1844); Wynne v. Taylor, 52 Tenn. 691, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 297 (1871).
      </p>
      <p>
       While in the statute no specification is made in respect to summary judgment against lendee of court funds, none was needed, as summary power in such case has existed from time immemorial over lendee and his sureties. Vaughn v. Tealey, 39 S.W. 868, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 93 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless bond so conditioned as to justify a summary judgment, court will not read such condition into bond, and such judgment must recite the jurisdictional facts, such as nature, condition and penalty of bond. Phillips v. Landess, 152 Tenn. 682, 280 S.W. 694, 1925 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (1926).

       The motion is regularly triable by the court, without a jury, and the proof should be heard by the court, and recited in the judgment as having appeared to the court. Clingman v.

       Where in the trial of a motion against an officer for nonreturn of an execution, the matter should not be submitted to a jury, such improper practice is not alone reversible error, and if disputed facts are submitted to the jury, it is nevertheless the duty of the judge to render proper judgment on the facts before him. Crowder v. Bradley, 1 Shan. 643 (1876).

Snell v. Rawlings, 22 Tenn. 85, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1842); Rose v. Lane, 22 Tenn. 218, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1842), criticized, Reichman v. Harris, 252 F. 371, 1918 U.S. App. LEXIS 2071 (6th Cir.

      <p>
       Shortly before the return day the sheriff receives the execution, he must make due return thereof by the return day, or incur the statutory penalty, though, if tendered to him too late to make a levy and return it, he might perhaps refuse to receive it, but he could not refuse to receive it simply because he would not have time to make sale by the return day. McCrory v. Chaffin, 31 Tenn. 307, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1851); Eaken & Co. v. Boyd, 37 Tenn. 204, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1857), criticized, Granberry v. Crosby, 54 Tenn. 579, 1872 Tenn.

       The language of the statute is imperative on the officer to return the execution within the time prescribed by law, and if he fails to make such return, he and his sureties are liable. Armstrong v. Apple, 42 Tenn. 280, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1865).

      <p>
       The return must show that the sheriff has done what the law requires of him, or a good reason why not. The return must be full and complete in itself, embracing every matter required to be stated. If a delivery bond was taken and forfeited, these facts form a proper and necessary part of the return, and their existence can be known to the court only from the certified return of the sheriff upon the writ. Therefore, in a proceeding directly impeaching the sufficiency of such return, and seeking to hold the sheriff responsible on account thereof, it is not permissible to look beyond the return to any extrinsic matter in aid of its defects.

       The falsity or insufficiency of the return must be such as is apparent on the face of the execution. An instance of such would be a return that property was levied on too late to sell, when the very date of the levy itself showed to the contrary. Probably the most common actually false return is that of “no property to be found”; but this cannot be reached by a motion for a false return, because the falsity can be made out only by the extrinsic evidence. In such case, the plaintiff must resort to his common law action for negligence in not finding and levying on property. Trigg v. McDonald, 21 Tenn. 386, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1841); Raines v.

       Endorsement of the words “in bankruptcy” is an adequate return by an officer on an execution where the question involves alone the sufficiency of the return upon its face, and not the question of the officer's diligence in the performance of his duty otherwise thereunder.

       A return that, there being no further personalty of defendants, therefore levy has been made on certain described land, this being too late for a sale, was held not to expose the sheriff to a motion for insufficient return. Trigg v. McDonald, 21 Tenn. 386, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1841).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the sheriff levied on personalty, twenty (20) days before the return day, and took a delivery bond therefor, which was forfeited, he was not liable for not having levied early enough to have left time for a levy and sale under the forfeited delivery bond, for he was not bound to anticipate the forfeiture of the delivery bond, and, hence, his return showed a sufficient reason for not making the money. Raines v. Childress, 21 Tenn. 449, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1841).

      <p>
       A return showing simply, “Not satisfied,” is no return, and the sheriff and his sureties are made liable thereby for the amount of the execution, with damages and costs. Kirkmans v. Rice, 23 Tenn. 267, 1843 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1843); Dunnaway v. Collier, 49 Tenn. 10, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 181 (1870).

      </p>
      <p>
       The return, “Came to hand the day issued, and nothing made for lack of time,” is an insufficient return, although there was not time, after the issuance of the execution, for a levy and sale, for there might have been at least a levy. McCrory v. Chaffin, 31 Tenn. 307, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1851).

      <p>
       Where the execution came to the sheriff's hands on the 26th of September, returnable the 26th of October, and on the 20th of October he made a levy, and thus returned the execution, “Returned for want of time to advertise and sell,” this was held to be insufficient, as it showed no excuse for delaying the levy until too late to advertise to sell. Smith v. Gilmore, 35 Tenn. 481, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 13 (1856); Eaken & Co. v. Boyd, 37 Tenn. 204, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1857), criticized, Granberry v. Crosby, 54 Tenn. 579, 1872 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       A return where there were several defendants, all primarily liable, that no personal property of one of them had been found, and that therefore certain land had been levied on, for which there were no bidders, was held to be insufficient, as not showing why the money had not been made out of the personalty of the other defendants. Hassell v. Southern Bank of Kentucky, 39 Tenn. 381, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 231 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the sheriff received the execution September 21, returnable to December 4, and returned it thus: “There being no personal property, etc., having searched for same until date of this levy, November 1, 1871, I, therefore, levy,” defendant waiving advertisement and notice and agreeing to a sale on December 2, but there being no sale then for want of bidders, the return was not insufficient, as the sheriff could not foresee that there would be no bidders. Howell v. Donaldson, 54 Tenn. 206, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “in bankruptcy,” clearly conveying the information that all the property of the execution debtor has been impounded as a result of the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, constitute an adequate return by an officer on an execution, for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy is a caveat to all the world.

      <p>
       A judgment by motion on an indemnity bond is allowed in favor of the indemnified officer only when a recovery has been had against him by some person other than the defendant in the execution; and if the recovery be by the latter, the officer is left to his common law remedy on the bond. Baker v. Agey, 21 Tenn. 13, 1840 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1840); Hunter v. Agee, 24 Tenn. 57, 1844 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1844).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indemnity bond executed to the officer, not by the plaintiff, but by a stranger, is a valid statutory bond, and the obligor is liable, on motion, to the officer. Jobe v. Sellars, 28 Tenn. 178, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 68 (1848).

       Motion should set forth the claims upon which it is founded, but where they are set forth in the notice, and the motion is heard upon the notice, and a judgment recites it, this is sufficient, because the objection is merely formal. Howard v. Horner, 30 Tenn. 532, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1851).

      </h4>
      <p>
       While county warrants are not negotiable, the holder and owner of a number of them may maintain one motion on the whole number in his own name, and his possession will be prima facie evidence of his ownership. Howard v. Horner, 30 Tenn. 532, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1851); Garner v. State, 73 Tenn. 213, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1880). See Davidson County v. Olwill, 72 Tenn. 28, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the warrant be payable to bearer, or to a particular person or order, it is so far assignable as to authorize suit by the holder against the trustee and his sureties if there be failure to pay moneys in his hands in order of presentation of warrants. Garner v. State, 73 Tenn. 213, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       When county warrants are regular on their face they establish prima facie the validity of the claims allowed, and authorize payment, but they have no other effect, and an assignee of such warrants takes subject to the risk that they are lawful and properly issued. Bank of Erin v. Houston County, 6 Tenn. App. 638, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 194 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       An order of forfeiture of bond which stated that it would become final on a specified future date “unless otherwise ordered” by the court, was a conditional judgment and not a final judgment as contemplated by this section.

Such statute did not begin to run at the rendition of the judgment, but only from payment. Vanderville v. Persons, 3 Shan. 415 (1875). See Maxey v. Carter, 18 Tenn. 521, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1837).

       Where a surety neglected to protect itself by the simple and routine expedient of requiring a bond application containing an indemnity clause, it must bear the expense of its attorney fees in defending an action against the principal and is not entitled to any indemnification from the principal even though the principal had refused to provide the surety with a defense and had undertaken its own defense.

       Sections 25-3-122 — 25-3-143 applicable to suretyship have no relevance where a contract of guarantee authorizes a compromise settlement of the principal's debt, and expressly retains the liability of the guarantor for the balance. Such a contract permits the extinguishment of the principal debt and although, to the extent of payment, the guarantor stands in the shoes of the creditor, there is nothing — no cause of action — to which he can be substituted, because the right of subrogation equitable or by statute has been contracted away.

       The use of the term “judgment” contemplates a final judgment and not a conditional judgment. State v. Taylor, 675 S.W.2d 721, 1984 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 2466 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of forfeiture of bond which stated that it would become final on a specified future date “unless otherwise ordered” by the court, was a conditional judgment and not a final judgment as contemplated by this section. State v. Taylor, 675 S.W.2d 721, 1984 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 2466 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bonding company or other surety on a bail bond should not be entitled to indemnification from an indemnitor pursuant to an indemnity agreement relating to such bond until some fixed amount has been set for which such surety would be liable to pay, and this event cannot occur until a final judgment of forfeiture has been entered. State v. Taylor, 675 S.W.2d 721, 1984 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 2466 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984).

       Attorney fees incurred and paid by a surety, with the consent of his cosureties, in making a prudent defense for the common benefit, constitute part of the joint liability, and are a proper matter for contribution.

       A cosurety who has paid less than his ratable share of the joint liability cannot enforce contribution, even against cosureties who have paid nothing. Gross v. Davis, 87 Tenn. 226, 11 S.W. 92, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 56, 10 Am. St. Rep. 635 (1889).

      <p>
       A judgment by motion obtained by one surety on a note against another surety as principal, his character of surety not appearing on the note itself, is voidable and may be enjoined, but equity will relieve only upon condition that the party do equity, by paying his moiety of the liability. Creed v. Scruggs, 48 Tenn. 590, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 118 (1870). See Estis v. Patton, 11 Tenn. 381, 11 Tenn. 382, 1832 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1832); Cain v. Jennings, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 131 (1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two sign as principals, and another as surety, and the one signing as principal was in fact surety, the burden of proof is upon the one signing as principal to show that he was in fact a surety, and if he had by his actions induced the one signing as surety to think that the other two were joint principals, he would be repelled from a court of equity if he sought contribution from the one signing as surety, whatever the fact might be. Coleman v. Norman, 57 Tenn. 590, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 269 (1873).

       Although an administrator of the principal may defeat recovery on a note, by a plea of the statute of limitations, that does not relieve the sureties of the intestate of liability, and the surety may have a remedy against the principal's administrator.

       If one surety is made to pay the whole debt, or more than his ratable share, he can, by motion, recover from each of the other sureties only his aliquot proportion of the liability. He cannot, by motion, recover more than this from the solvent cosureties, on account of the insolvency of the rest, whose proportion he has had to pay; but, by bill in equity, he can compel the solvent cosureties to contribute to the payment of the entire amount so paid, as the rate of contribution in such suit is determined according to the number of solvent sureties. Riley v. Rhea, 73 Tenn. 115, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 93 (1880); Gross v. Davis, 87 Tenn. 226, 11 S.W. 92, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 56, 10 Am. St. Rep. 635 (1889). See Bittick v. McEwen, 54 Tenn. 1, 1871 Tenn.

       Where more than one of the sureties have made payments on the joint indebtedness, all the payments must be added together, and the aggregate divided equally among the sureties; and where a bill for contribution among the solvent sureties is filed in equity, each must be charged with his share thus ascertained, and credited with the entire amount of his payments; and he must pay the balance thus found against him. If he has paid more than his ratable part, he will recover same from the other parties. Gross v. Davis, 87 Tenn. 226, 11 S.W. 92, 1888 Tenn. LEXIS 56, 10 Am. St. Rep. 635 (1889).

       Where one surety has paid the entire debt, and then collected from one cosurety more than his share, and afterwards filed a bill against another cosurety for his proportion, the latter cannot, after answer filed, by an arrangement made with the former cosurety, to which arrangement the complainant was no party, pay such cosurety the overplus due him, and claim a credit for such payment as against the complainant.

       For his costs of a reasonable and bona fide defense, incurred by a surety or accommodation endorser in resisting, in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, a recovery against him, such surety or endorser is entitled to indemnity, and may enforce it against his principal; but he cannot exact reimbursement for costs where he litigated recklessly and without authority, in a clearly hopeless case.

       This statute gives the motion against the persons in default and all persons in existence liable with him, that is, against the principal and all living sureties. If some sureties be dead, the motion may be made against the principal and the surviving sureties, but if the principal be dead, the motion cannot be made against the sureties alone unless, of course, some statute expressly so provides.

   Prior to the enactment of §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c03s25-3-106" target="_self">25-3-106</a></cite> the remedy by motion did not extend to the personal representative of a deceased officer or to his surety, and could not be maintained against either, but under §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c03s25-3-106" target="_self">25-3-106</a></cite> where the officer or part of his sureties die during the pendency of the motion it may be revived against the personal representative of such officer or surety.

       Where there is a motion without notice, the supreme court will not correct the judgment void for want of proper recitals, nor remand the cause for an amendment equivalent to a new suit. If appearance of the defendant by counsel in the lower and supreme courts amount to waiver of notice, it creates no obligation to appear again in the lower court and waive notice of a new motion or of an amendment of the original motion equal to commencement of a new suit.

       Before the enactment of this section, where execution was not issued within a year and a day after the date of the judgment, the judgment creditor was compelled, in order to obtain it, to bring the defendant into court by scire facias to show cause why the judgment should not be revived and execution issued against him; but, by this section, this practice was abolished, and it is not necessary to revive judgments by scire facias in such cases, but executions may issue as a matter of course until 10 years after the rendition of the judgments. Gregory v. Chadwell, 43 Tenn. 390, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1866); Lain v. Lain, 62 Tenn. 30, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (1873).

       Trial court erred in its order extending the judgment in not giving the proper retroactive effect to the nunc pro tunc provision of its final judgment because the original final judgment successfully was renewed for an additional ten years; therefore, the Tenn. R. Civ. P. 69.04 motion was filed timely, and the final judgment had been renewed. Cook v. Alley, 419 S.W.3d 256, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 227 (Tenn. Ct.

      <p>
       A scire facias to revive a judgment is treated as a new suit, and not merely a continuation of the former suit. It is a judicial writ, founded on some matter of record, as a recognizance or judgment, on which it lies to obtain execution, or for other purposes; and, because the defendant may plead thereto, it is considered in law a new action. Swancy v. Scott, 28 Tenn. 327, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1848); Gregory v. Chadwell, 43 Tenn. 390, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1866); Bilbo v. Allen, 51 Tenn. 31, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (1871); Fogg v.

       A scire facias to revive a judgment is so far in the nature of a new action, that any defense may be made which will prevent the revivor. McIntosh v. Paul, 74 Tenn. 45, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1880); Bank of West Tenn. v. Marr, 81 Tenn. 108, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1884).

       A judgment cannot be revived against the defendant upon the motion of the plaintiff alone, for it is in the nature of a new suit to recover upon the former judgment, and the revivor should be upon scire facias or an appearance and waiver of the writ. The scire facias should be to the defendant if living, or, if he be dead, to his representatives or heirs. Fogg v. Gibbs, 67 Tenn. 464, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1875); Bank of West Tenn. v.

       After the lapse of 10 years from the rendition of the judgment, the scire facias to revive the same can only issue by order of the court, made on motion, and supported by affidavit that the judgment remains in force and unsatisfied; and after the lapse of 20 years the defendant must have notice of the motion and affidavit, and the court may exercise its discretion, and allow or refuse the motion, as may seem proper in the case.

       A proceeding by scire facias to revive a judgment after 20 years requires an affidavit, but if none was filed, and no objection was taken below for the failure to file the affidavit, the defendant will not be heard to make the objection in the appellate court.

      <p>
       It is essential that the affidavit for suing out a writ of scire facias to revive a judgment after 10 years should state the recovery of the judgment, the lapse of over 10 years from its rendition, and that it remains in full force and unsatisfied.

       In reviving a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction, where the record shows service of summons and trial by jury, the fact that no plea was filed would not render the judgment void.

       Proper entry of revivor of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, upon a scire facias to revive, is that the original judgment stand revived, and that the plaintiff have execution against the defendant therefor, with interest and costs of suit, and the costs of the scire facias to revive, subject to any credit for any payments found to have been made, with the date of the same; and it is not proper to render a new judgment for the old judgment with the accrued interest.

       The death of one or more defendants in a judgment interposes no obstacle to the issuance of an execution without reviving the judgment. The execution should issue in usual form against all the defendants, but it would be proper to suggest the death of the deceased defendant. It is the duty of the officer to proceed to collect the debt from the surviving defendants, and, if necessary, to levy upon their property, though they may be sureties or stayors. Cheatham v. Brien, 40 Tenn. 552, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 162 (1859); H.S. Dickinson & Son v. Bowers, 66 Tenn. 307, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (1874).

       Where the plaintiff dies after the judgment and before execution, it seems to be necessary to revive by scire facias, but if the execution had issued before his death, it may be levied and the property sold, as if his death had not occurred, or if execution be tested before his death, though issued afterwards, the same result follows.

       The object of this and following sections is to enable a purchaser to ascertain from the records of the county of the landowner's residence whether or not there are judgment liens on his lands.

       Since the county court is a court of record, its judgments come under the statute. Hickman v. Murfree, 8 Tenn. 26, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1827).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section refers to a judgment lien upon land, and has no reference to personal property, the lien of an execution upon such property, or the relation of that lien to the teste of the execution. Cecil v. Carson, 86 Tenn. 139, 5 S.W. 532, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       The execution of a bail bond does not create a lien on the lands of the obligors and is only an evidence of debt, for the recovery of which an action must be brought. It is different from a recognizance, which is a matter of record in the nature of a conditional judgment, and is proceeded upon by scire facias. Cole v. Warner, 93 Tenn. 155, 23 S.W. 110, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1893).

       The lien of a judgment will not, in equity, attach upon the mere legal title to land existing in the defendant, when the equitable title is in another person. Huffaker v. Bowman, 36 Tenn. 89, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1856); Fite v. Jennings, 193 Tenn. 250, 246 S.W.2d 1, 1952 Tenn. LEXIS 289 (1952).

       The judgment lien is only given by statute, and cannot be extended by construction. Davidson v. Shearon, 1 Shan. 304 (1874); Gardenhire v. King, 97 Tenn. 585, 37 S.W. 548, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 185 (1896).

       The judgment lien is a statutory lien which has always been strictly construed, and is lost, if the provisions of the statute are not complied with. Weaver v.

       A tender by a judgment debtor to the judgment creditor of the full amount of the judgment debt is not a satisfaction of the judgment, or a discharge of the judgment lien, and, if not continuous and kept good, it does not even stop the interest. The remedy of the debtor, if a legal tender be refused, is to apply to the court to restrain the sale under the execution, and enter satisfaction of the judgment by the money brought into court.

       Where the conveyance of land is absolute on its face, but was intended as a mortgage, and is held to be such, it is not subject to levy of execution as the land of such conveyee, and the purchaser of such land under such execution sale obtains no title, because he can obtain no better or higher title than his debtor had.

       Where the lender of money paid the same to a mortgagee, receiving a release of the mortgage from the mortgagee, and taking a new mortgage from the mortgagor to secure the loan, and both the release and the new mortgage were simultaneously registered, the transaction must be regarded as a continuous one, and as but a means adopted for passing the title to the new mortgagee, or the trustee under the mortgage, so as to prevent the judgment of a third party attaching as a lien on the land as that of the mortgagor while held for the instant in passing the title from the original mortgagee to the new mortgagee advancing the money to discharge the original mortgage.

P. 56.04 to plaintiff in a suit in which it sought a declaratory judgment establishing the priority of its judgment lien because defendant had mistakenly released a prior deed of trust on the property in question and restoring the deed of trust to its priority position would not prejudice plaintiff's rights; although plaintiff's judgment lien was properly recorded under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c05s25-5-101" target="_self">25-5-101</a></cite> and became effective against later acquired interests under §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c05s25-5-101" target="_self">25-5-101</a></cite> and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c24s66-24-119" target="_blank">66-24-119</a></cite>, and notwithstanding the fact that the mistaken release resulted in an equitable lien subject to the recording and notice provisions under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c26s66-26-101" target="_blank">66-26-101</a></cite> and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.66.html#t66c26s66-26-103" target="_blank">66-26-103</a></cite>, plaintiff was still entitled to seek the equitable remedy of cancellation of the release.

       Original judgment constituted an ordinary personal money judgment in favor of the father against the daughter in the amount of $ 193,000, with no prohibition against garnishment or other means of execution or enforcement of the judgment, and therefore the father could enforce the original judgment by garnishment or any other means allowed by law.

       A judgment lien upon a debtor's equitable interest in land is lost unless the suit to enforce it is brought within 30 days after the return of the original execution and it will not suffice to bring suit within 30 days after the return of an alias execution nulla bona, if more than 30 days have elapsed after the return of the original execution.

       Because the debtor's ex-wife perfected her judgment lien prior to the bank, and the ten-year period had not lapsed, the ex-wife's rights as a lien holder were junior only to another creditor; her lien attached to the excess proceeds from the foreclosure sale and entitled her to payment in full before any payments were made to creditors of lesser priority.

       State law does not preserve the judgment lien enforcement period beyond its term even though enforcement is precluded by the Bankruptcy Code. Weaver v. Hamrick, 907 S.W.2d 385, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 458 (Tenn. 1995).

   Judgments in favor of several creditors against the same defendant, rendered upon different days of the same term of the court, as shown by the record, relate, as between the judgment creditors, to the first day of the term, and any moneys realized upon the executions issued thereon from that term must be divided pro rata on the amounts due upon such executions. Porter v. Earthman, 12 Tenn. 358, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1833); Berry v. Clements, 28 Tenn. 312, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1848), rev'd, <cite class="us_code">52 U.S. 398</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">13 L.

       <p>
   A judgment is a lien upon the real estate of the defendant from the time of the convening of the court, as shown by the minutes on the day the judgment was rendered, but if the minutes do not show the time the court convened, the judgment relates to the first instant of that day. Berry v. Clements, 28 Tenn. 312, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1848), rev'd, <cite class="us_code">52 U.S. 398</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">13 L. Ed. 745</cite>, 1850 U.S. LEXIS 1517 (1851); Cox v.

   Judgments do not relate beyond the date of their rendition, so as to form liens upon the real estate of the debtor as against bona fide purchasers, for a valuable consideration, before the date of the rendition of the judgments. Berry v. Clements, 28 Tenn. 312, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1848), rev'd, <cite class="us_code">52 U.S. 398</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">13 L. Ed. 745</cite>, 1850 U.S. LEXIS 1517 (1851).

   Where the record shows at what time the court convened, judgments rendered on that day relate to that time; but if the record does not show at what time the court convened, evidence aliunde is inadmissible to show the time, and judgments rendered on that day relate, in such case, to the first instant of the day, and attach as liens upon the real estate of the judgment debtors, at the time of such relation; and when judgments are rendered on the first day of the term, executions issued thereon, tested of that day, must necessarily have the same relation, and attach as liens upon the personal property of the judgment debtors, at the same time. Berry v. Clements, 28 Tenn. 312, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1848), rev'd, <cite class="us_code">52 U.S. 398</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">13 L. Ed. 745</cite>, 1850 U.S. LEXIS 1517 (1851); Cox v.

       If the land be levied upon and sold within one year after the rendition of the judgment, the purchaser's title relates to the date of judgment, and overreaches the intermediate alienations of the judgment debtor, although made to purchasers with knowledge of such judgment lien. Hickman v. Murfree, 8 Tenn. 26, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 2 (1827); Miller's Lessee v. Estill, 16 Tenn. 452, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 106 (1835); Dickinson's Lessee v. Collins, 31 Tenn. 516, 1852 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       The enforcement of a judgment lien by execution levy and sale within 12 months gives the purchaser at such sale a title superior to that of one who bought the land from the judgment debtor while the lien was upon it, and before such sale. Purchaser may recover the land from one claiming a junior and inferior title under the judgment debtor. Hyder v. Butler, 103 Tenn. 289, 52 S.W. 876, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchaser from judgment creditor after entry of judgment decree was entitled to priority over purchaser at sheriff's sale which was held more than one year after judgment was rendered by court although less than one year after date of entry of judgment nunc pro tunc as of date of rendition, as judgment lien ran from date fixed by nunc pro tunc order rather than date of actual entry of judgment. Southern Mortg. Guaranty Corp. v. King, 168 Tenn. 309, 77 S.W.2d 810, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where judgment lien attached to property before deed conveying such property was recorded and such lien was enforced by execution within the prescribed time although the levy of the execution did not take place until after the recording of such deed, the title of the purchaser at the execution sale was acquired pursuant to the judgment lien and was therefore superior to the title conveyed by the deed. Hames v. Archer Paper Co., 45 Tenn. App. 1, 319 S.W.2d 252, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).

       The judgment lien attaches to after acquired lands, instantly upon their acquisition, even though acquired after the expiration of one year from the rendition of the judgment; and such lien continues for the period of one year from the time the title may be acquired by the judgment debtor, within which period it may be made effectual by a levy and sale of such acquired lands, and such levy and sale will overreach and avoid any intermediate alienation of the judgment debtor within that period.

       A judgment lien is not extended by revivor of decedent's judgment, in the name of his personal representative, nor is such revived judgment a new judgment for the purpose of creating a new lien which will exist for a year from the date of the revivor. So, where an execution issued from the revived judgment is levied, more than one year from the date of the original judgment, upon lands of the judgment debtor, which he had previously sold and conveyed by deeds duly registered, the execution sale of the same will be enjoined at the instance of such purchasers. Davidson v. Shearon, 1 Shan. 304 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien of a judgment obtained in the lifetime of the defendant, and affirmed in the supreme court, after his death, attaches to his lands, and may be enforced in an insolvency administration suit instituted before the affirmance of the judgment in the supreme court, by a cross bill filed by the judgment creditor, for the provision for the ratable division of insolvent estates of decedents among their creditors was not intended to affect liens acquired in the lifetime of the insolvent deceased debtor, but was designed merely to abolish the preference which existed at common law. Bangess v. Partee, 2 Shan. 264 (1877).

      <p>
       Where an execution on the judgment of a court of record is issued after, but bears teste before, the judgment debtor's death, and is afterwards levied on lands subject to the judgment lien, which are sold thereunder, without revivor of the judgment, within 12 months after its rendition, the sale is valid, and communicates to the purchaser the judgment debtor's title to the lands.

      <p>
       A levy and sale for the enforcement of the judgment lien, made at any time within the period of one year after the rendition of the judgment or after the dismissal of adverse proceedings, overreaches and avoids all intermediate alienations by the judgment debtor, of whatever character; but the levy and sale must be made within the time limited, because, at the expiration of the one year, the lien is extinguished for all purposes, and all conveyances bona fide made by the judgment debtor, whether absolute or in trust, whether made before the creation of the lien, or during its existence, or after its expiration, become valid and binding, and cannot be questioned by the judgment creditor. Dickinson's Lessee v. Collins, 31 Tenn. 516, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1852); Davis v. Benton, 34 Tenn. 665, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 115 (1855); Branner v. Nance, 43 Tenn. 299, 1866 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a judgment lien is enforced by sale of the land within 12 months after the rendition of the judgment, it will not prevail against subsequent encumbrances, even where the sale was delayed by agreement, and execution was levied and bill filed within 12 months to enforce the lien. Gardenhire v. King, 97 Tenn. 585, 37 S.W. 548, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 185 (1896); Bridges v. Cooper, 98 Tenn. 394, 39 S.W. 723, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 233 (1897); Fidelity & Deposit Co. v.

       A judgment lien cannot be extended beyond the statutory period by the judgment creditor's unnecessary and unsuccessful suit in equity for its enforcement. Bridges v. Cooper, 98 Tenn. 394, 39 S.W. 723, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 233 (1897); Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Fulcher Brick Co., 161 Tenn. 298, 30 S.W.2d 253, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1930).

       Limitations period of one year was tolled by the automatic stay provisions in the bankruptcy code. In re Harbin, 25 B.R. 703, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5203 (Bankr. W.D.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since the lien enforcement period continues to run during a bankruptcy proceeding, a judgment lien creditor ordinarily has three options: (1) move the bankruptcy court to lift the stay; (2) execute on the judgment after the bankruptcy proceeding terminates, if the three-year period has not expired; or (3) execute on the judgment during the 30-day grace period following the lifting of the stay or termination of the bankruptcy proceeding.

       This section, which tolls the 12-month period if sale is “prevented” by injunction or by appeal, was not rendered inapplicable because the debtors never filed a bond which would have stayed execution. In re Bell, 55 B.R. 246, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 4923 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1985).

      <p>
       An appeal from a judgment at law or decree in equity suspends, but does not destroy or annul, the judgment lien upon the debtor's land. Covington v. Bass, 88 Tenn. 496, 12 S.W. 1033, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1890); Denton v. Nashville Title Co., 112 Tenn. 320, 79 S.W. 799, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1903); Fort v.

   As a result of this tolling section, in the case of appeal in the nature of a writ of error, where other statutory steps are taken, the lien given by §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c05s25-5-101" target="_self">25-5-101</a></cite> is not lost and can be perfected within one year after the appeal is dismissed or the judgment below affirmed.

      <p>
       Where a judgment is rendered during the pendency of an appeal and the person securing the second judgment, while the appeal is pending, attempts to assert the second judgment as prior to the first because the necessary proceeding has not been taken within the year to assert the first lien, the one obtaining the lien in the first instance in the circuit court will prevail, his judgment being affirmed, since this section was passed to protect the person who first obtains the lien. The affirmance of the judgment of the circuit court by the court of appeals is a mere renewal of continuance of the old judgment. When this judgment is affirmed the rights of the parties revert to the entry of the judgment in the circuit court. Shepard v. Lanier, 192 Tenn. 608, 241 S.W.2d 587, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 308 (1951).

       The affirmance by the appellate court of a judgment or decree upon appeal in error or writ of error, by the rendition of a new judgment, or the rendition of a new judgment upon dismissing a supersedeas, will not affect the statutory lien.

      <p>
       A levy is necessary for a sale, and, if an officer, with process in his hands in ample time for the making of levy and sale, is prevented from doing these things incident to sale, he is as clearly prevented as if a levy had been made. The section does not mean only prevention after a levy. Brinkley v. Welch, 75 Tenn. 278, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 113 (1881). See also Lincoln Sav. Bank v. Ewing, 80 Tenn. 598, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 211 (1883).

      </h4>
      <p>
       A judgment creditor who has an execution levied upon land, and files his bill to remove an obstruction, as a fraudulent conveyance, has a prior lien over a creditor who afterwards obtains judgment, has execution issued and levied, and land sold within one year, and before the hearing of the bill filed by the first judgment creditor, because he had acquired a specific lien on the property, and had a right to come into equity to remove the obstruction which would prevent a sale at a fair valuation. Shepherd v. Woodfolk, 78 Tenn. 593, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 229 (1882). See Wessel v. Brown, 78 Tenn. 685, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 237 (1882); Fidelity & Deposit Co. v.

       A general creditors' bill enjoining execution on judgment was sufficient to continue the lien under this section. Sweetwater Bank & Trust Co. v. Howard, 16 Tenn. App. 91, 66 S.W.2d 225, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 37 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

       Where judgment creditor asked an adjudication that a decree rendered on a creditor's bill did not enjoin him from executing, he was not estopped from later asserting that the decree did in effect prevent levy and sale within the statutory period.

       Unnecessary, unsuccessful suit in equity for enforcement of lien cannot extend the time. Bridges v. Cooper, 98 Tenn. 394, 39 S.W. 723, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 233 (1897); Weaver v. Smith, 102 Tenn. 47, 50 S.W. 771, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant of lien filed a bill asserting its priority over a mortgage subsequently registered, such proceeding was not “adverse,” and did not excuse failure to take out execution within 12 months. The proceedings are only adverse when restraining sale, by analogy to an injunction. Alienation after lien attaches is not an obstruction. Unfounded doubts as to existence of rights cannot avail. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Fulcher Brick Co., 161 Tenn. 298, 30 S.W.2d 253, 1929 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1930).

       A judgment creditor filing a bill to enjoin the judgment debtor from prosecuting an appeal to the supreme court, and from assigning errors in the judgment, and obtaining an affirmance of his judgment as the result of affirming his decree in the chancery court, loses the lien of his judgment, because such affirmance did not relate back to the date of the original judgment, and did not perpetuate the lien thereof.

      <p>
       Where the issuance of execution within 12 months after the affirmance of judgment in the supreme court is obstructed by an injunction or otherwise, the judgment lien still exists for 12 months after the removal of such obstructions, and if execution be issued contrary to legal prohibitions, it will not operate as a waiver of the judgment lien.
