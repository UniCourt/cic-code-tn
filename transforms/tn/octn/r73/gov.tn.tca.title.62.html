        Defendant, who was not a registered architect, but who was designing buildings extensive in size and with numerous rooms, was practicing architecture, and was not exempt on the ground that public safety or health was not involved, since designing of buildings involved public safety and health; hence it was proper to enjoin defendant from further practice.

        Defendant, who was not a registered architect, but who was designing buildings extensive in size and with numerous rooms, was practicing architecture, and was not exempt on the ground that public safety or health was not involved, since designing of buildings involved public safety and health, hence it was proper to enjoin defendant from further practice.

        Funeral directing includes the operation of a crematory. State ex rel. Cunningham v. Feezell, 218 Tenn. 17, 400 S.W.2d 716, 1966 Tenn. LEXIS 549 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Practice of funeral directing still includes the operation of a crematory, and this was consistent with the general assembly's definition of a funeral establishment to include both funeral homes and crematories; clearly, state lawmakers did not view funeral homes and crematories as separate industries, but rather as complementary services offered by the funeral industry.

         The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

         Attorney General Opinions. The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

          A plan offered for a prepaid, nonrefundable fee to arrange the professional transport of a dead human body from any site of death to a licensed funeral provider – but only if the contract beneficiary’s future death occurs more than seventy-five miles away from home – qualifies as a “pre-need funeral contract” under the Tennessee Prepaid Funeral Benefits Act.  If the plan described above is sold in conjunction with another contract that meets the definition of a “pre-need funeral contract,” the plan still qualifies as a “pre-need funeral contract” under the Act.

           Every pre-need seller engaged in the business of selling pre-need funeral contracts funded by a trust shall establish a pre-need funeral trust fund. The trust fund shall be established by executing a written trust agreement with a trustee; provided, that a pre-need seller may change the trustee of its trust fund by providing written notice to the commissioner no later than thirty (30) days prior to the change, along with evidence sufficient to the commissioner that the trustee will be able to comply with the requirements of this part. If the commissioner determines that the evidence submitted is insufficient to ensure that the trustee will be able to comply with the requirements of this part, the commissioner may refuse to allow the pre-need seller to change the trustee. If the commissioner does not object to the change of trustee within sixty (60) calendar days of receiving a request, the current trustee shall have not less than ninety (90) calendar days from the date it receives notice of the proposed change to transfer all trust assets related to the pre-need funeral contracts issued by the pre-need seller held by the trustee to the successor trustee.

              Appellate court could not conclude that plaintiff was seeking to determine who had the right to make decisions regarding the remains of her mother, but, rather, the language in the civil warrant could be read to assert a claim against defendant for ignoring plaintiff's right to control disposition of her mother's remains; and subject matter jurisdiction over such a claim was not limited by statute to probate court; thus, the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff's claim under the statutes concerning disposition of human remains for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

        The owner and trustee of the property on which an unlicensed subcontractor held a lien, were among the class of persons the licensing statute was designed to protect and they were entitled to raise the failure of the subcontractor to obtain a license as a defense to a suit in quantum meruit.

        The general rule regarding the effect of noncompliance with licensing statutes on the enforceability of contracts is neither explicitly nor implicitly required by the licensing statute. The rule is a judicial creation designed to further the public policy behind the statute. Gene Taylor & Sons Plumbing Co. v. Corondolet Realty Trust, 611 S.W.2d 572, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 401 (Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A subcontractor not licensed under this chapter could recover on a quantum meruit theory against a licensed general contractor under a subcontract agreement because the policies that bar recovery against a member of the general public do not apply in suits against licensed professionals in the same business.

        Those who have contracts to perform portions of larger projects which portions do not exceed $50,000.00 (now $25,000.00) are not required by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-102" target="_self">62-6-102</a></cite> to have general contractor's license even when the total cost of construction of all of those who work on the project exceeds $50,000.00 (now $25,000.00).

        In an action arising from a construction project, where defendant counterclaimant had contracted directly with the owner, the nature of the work fell within the statutory definition of “contracting,” and the total cost of the completed work exceeded $25,000, defendant should have obtained a contractor's license, and his recovery from the owner was limited to the actual documented expenses for the work that he could establish by clear and convincing proof.

        Trial court did not err when it held that contractor, who had not maintained a valid license throughout the entire contract period, was deemed unlicensed and in violation of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1b" target="_self">62-6-103(b)</a></cite>, and was therefore limited to recovery of the documented expenses proven by clear and convincing evidence.

        Language of the licensing statutes, particularly T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-102ol13A" target="_self">62-6-102(3)(A)</a></cite> and (6) [now (4)(A) and (7)], is crystal-clear and requires no interpretation: “contracting” encompasses all phases and aspects of construction, from contract formation through the contract's completion; any person or entity that engages in any of the activities classified as “contracting” must submit evidence of qualifications and be licensed, according to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1a" target="_self">62-6-103(a)</a></cite>. If a person engages in any of these activities without possessing a valid license, then simple logic dictates that the person is an unlicensed contractor for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1b" target="_self">62-6-103(b)</a></cite> and is limited in recovery to those documented expenses proven by clear and convincing evidence.

        In bankruptcy case where judgment creditors attempted to obtain ruling that debt owed them by debtor construction contractor was excepted from discharge due to debtor's misrepresentation regarding whether he was licensed, insufficient evidence supported allegation that debtor made that claim, but even so, a license was not mandated by Tennessee law for the work because it was for less than $25,000, so the misrepresentation would not have been material to the contract.

        Where duty devolved on the builder whether or not his foreman was a licensed contractor, action in tort would lie against the builder regardless of the foreman's being unlicensed. Wilson v. Page, 45 Tenn. App. 475, 325 S.W.2d 294, 1958 Tenn. App. LEXIS 132 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an unlicensed contractor had made a proper application for license on file, with the necessary fee paid in full, before he entered into the subject contract, and it was only upon being assured by the principal executive officer of the licensing authority that a license was not required for his operations that he did not promptly complete all of the necessary steps for obtaining a license, the unlicensed contractor was permitted to recover the actual expenses for labor and materials which he expended on the residence. Coleman v. Anderson, 620 S.W.2d 77, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 472 (Tenn. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A contractor who fails to meet technical requirements of the licensing statutes may nevertheless be allowed to recover on a quantum meruit theory. Chedester v. Phillips, 640 S.W.2d 207, 1982 Tenn. LEXIS 357 (Tenn. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action arising from a construction project, where defendant counterclaimant had contracted directly with the owner, the nature of the work fell within the statutory definition of “contracting,” and the total cost of the completed work exceeded $25,000, defendant should have obtained a contractor's license, and his recovery from the owner was limited to the actual documented expenses for the work that he could establish by clear and convincing proof. Winter v. Smith, 914 S.W.2d 527, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        An unlicensed contractor did not have a claim under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103" target="_self">62-6-103</a></cite> and was not entitled to indemnity from the owner for material payments or legal expenses where the owner has already paid more than the contractor's actual documented expenses. Winter v. Smith, 914 S.W.2d 527, 1995 Tenn. App. LEXIS 553 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        An unlicensed contractor cannot recover under its contract with the owner or on quantum meruit but, under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103" target="_self">62-6-103</a></cite>, is limited to actual documented expenses upon a showing of clear and convincing proof; where the contractor fails to establish actual documented expenses, and the evidence it does present is not clear and convincing, its action will fail. Roberts v. Houston, 970 S.W.2d 488, 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 871 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err when it held that contractor, who had not maintained a valid license throughout the entire contract period, was deemed unlicensed and in violation of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1b" target="_self">62-6-103(b)</a></cite>, and was therefore limited to recovery of the documented expenses proven by clear and convincing evidence. Kyle v. Williams, 98 S.W.3d 661, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (Tenn. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of the licensing statutes, particularly T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-102ol13A" target="_self">62-6-102(3)(A)</a></cite> and (6) [now (4)(A) and (7)], is crystal-clear and requires no interpretation: “contracting” encompasses all phases and aspects of construction, from contract formation through the contract's completion; any person or entity that engages in any of the activities classified as “contracting” must submit evidence of qualifications and be licensed, according to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1a" target="_self">62-6-103(a)</a></cite>. If a person engages in any of these activities without possessing a valid license, then simple logic dictates that the person is an unlicensed contractor for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1b" target="_self">62-6-103(b)</a></cite> and is limited in recovery to those documented expenses proven by clear and convincing evidence. Kyle v. Williams, 98 S.W.3d 661, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (Tenn. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Allowing unlicensed contractors to recover only documented expenses proven by clear and convincing evidence is an expansion of the remedies previously available to unlicensed contractors in Tennessee. Kyle v. Williams, 98 S.W.3d 661, 2003 Tenn. LEXIS 164 (Tenn. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly revoked defendant construction company's license based upon the construction company's unlawfully obtaining the permit for another unlicensed contractor, which was required by T.C.A. 62-6-103(a)(1) to have a license, allowing the unlicensed contractor to do work it otherwise would not be authorized to do, which amounted to a civil conspiracy. Danny L. Davis Contrs., Inc. v. Hobbs, 157 S.W.3d 414, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 492 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 165 (Tenn. Feb. 28, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which an unlicensed subcontractor was hired to install wiring and machinery for a bowling alley, and the general contractor failed to pay the subcontractor's last five invoices, because the language in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c06s62-6-103ol1b" target="_self">62-6-103(b)</a></cite> did not create a new cause of action, and the statute was consistent with the measure of damages allowed at common law, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint based on the subcontractor's failure to assert a cause of action under this subsection. Sifuentes v. D.E.C., LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 367 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2020).

        Contractor did not violate the Tennessee Contractor's Licensing Act (TCLA) by entering into a site contract and a building contract for a project which, together, exceeded the monetary limit of the contractor's license because (1) the contractor entered into the contracts in an effort to comply with the TCLA, and (2) the contractor sought to accommodate a sophisticated owner who was aware of the licensing limit by entering into the contracts. Beacon4, LLC v. I & L Invs., LLC, 514 S.W.3d 153, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 637 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2016), appeal denied, Beacon4, LLC v. I & L Invs., LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 950 (Tenn. Dec. 15, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the contractor signed the contract and performed the work for the homeowners, he was not subject to the limitation of actual documented expenses as he was not unlicensed, and therefore he was not limited retroactively by the provisions of the amended statute; the court does not condone contractors exceeding their monetary limits, but given the law in effect at the time of the contract in this case, the contractor was not limited to his actual documented expenses. Pickens v. Underwood, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 322 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 12, 2018), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 556 (Tenn. Sept. 14, 2018).

       <p>
        Amendment was substantive in nature, and the effect was to expand the limitation of actual documented expenses to any contractor required to be licensed under the statute and rules, whereas before this limitation applied only to unlicensed contractors.

        The indemnification provision in crane service's standard rental agreement providing that lessee would indemnify crane service against any damages caused by the crane's operation, except crane service would be liable for damages caused by its sole negligence up to the amount of its liability insurance, was statutorily void as against public policy, in spite of the fact it had liability insurance. It was impossible to predict whether damages from its sole negligence would be covered by its insurance. Armoneit v. Elliott Crane Serv., 65 S.W.3d 623, 2001 Tenn. App. LEXIS 506 (Tenn. Ct.

          Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a home inspector because, while he failed to report the improper construction of a deck railing, the inspector did not owe a legal duty to a guest who fell from the deck when the railing collapsed where, inter alia, the guest was not a person for whose benefit and guidance the inspector intended to supply the information in the report, the inspector and the inspection company had no reason to suspect that the home inspection report was necessary for the protection of a third person, the Home Inspector License Act and the agreement between the inspector and the owner did not permit third parties to see or rely upon the home inspection report.

       An innkeeper is “practically an insurer” (liable without fault) of personal property of a guest “infra hospitium.” Shepherd Fleets, Inc. v. Opryland USA, Inc., 759 S.W.2d 914, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Infra hospitium” means “in the care and custody of the innkeeper.” Shepherd Fleets, Inc. v. Opryland USA, Inc., 759 S.W.2d 914, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The strict liability rule concerning the liability of innkeepers, as adopted in Tennessee, includes any property delivered and accepted into the exclusive custody of the innkeeper and the term “infra hospitium” includes all property deposited and accepted in exclusive control of the innkeeper, wherever the innkeeper elects to physically store the property, whatever its character, so long as it is not the type of property for which special statutory provision exists. Shepherd Fleets, Inc. v. Opryland USA, Inc., 759 S.W.2d 914, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       An innkeeper is excused from liability for loss of a guest's baggage or goods only when the loss or injury results from an act of God or is caused by the public enemy, or by the fault, direct or implied, of the guest himself. Shepherd Fleets, Inc. v. Opryland USA, Inc., 759 S.W.2d 914, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 294 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).

       The innkeeper is not liable for the loss, by theft or otherwise, of the baggage and goods of a boarder, unless it is shown that the loss resulted from the culpable negligence or wrongful act of himself or his servants. Manning v. Wells, 28 Tenn. 746, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1849).
      </p>
      <p>
       The innkeeper is not liable for the embezzlement or misappropriation of money by his clerk, left by a guest with the clerk, upon his departure to be gone for a time. Whitemore v. Haroldson, 70 Tenn. 312, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 235 (1879); Tulane Hotel Co. v. Holohan, 112 Tenn. 214, 79 S.W. 113, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 98, 105 Am. St. Rep. 930 (1904).

      <p>
       A hotel keeper complying with the former law was relieved from liability as an insurer where the guest failed to comply with the provisions thereof. Rains v. Maxwell House Co., 112 Tenn. 219, 79 S.W. 114, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 99, <cite class="lra">64 L.R.A. 470</cite> (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       The former law was in derogation of the common law, and was strictly construed with reference to its evident object and purpose, namely, the benefit and protection of hotel keepers. Rains v. Maxwell House Co., 112 Tenn. 219, 79 S.W. 114, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 99, <cite class="lra">64 L.R.A. 470</cite> (1904).

      <p>
       Where an innkeeper, through its servants employed for that purpose, met a traveler on his arrival at the hotel, received his baggage into its possession, deposited it at the usual place, and served him with such refreshments as he desired, for the usual and customary charges, the innkeeper is liable for the loss of the traveler's baggage, and cannot escape such liability upon the ground that the traveler did not formally notify the innkeeper that he was a traveler who had resorted to the hotel to receive entertainment.

       An innkeeper, to whom one not a guest sends goods to be held without compensation to be made therefore, will not be liable as an innkeeper, if the goods are lost, but only as a gratuitous bailee, that is, for loss or damages occasioned by his gross negligence. Whitemore v. Haroldson, 70 Tenn. 312, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 235 (1879); Tulane Hotel Co. v. Holohan, 112 Tenn. 214, 79 S.W. 113, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 98, 105 Am. St. Rep. 930 (1904); Hill v.

       A traveling salesman, at the railroad depot, turning his suitcases over to the porter of a hotel, with the intention of going there, but changing his mind and not going there, does not become a guest of the hotel, so as to charge the proprietor with the innkeeper's extraordinary liability. Tulane Hotel Co. v. Holohan, 112 Tenn. 214, 79 S.W. 113, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 98, 105 Am. St. Rep. 930 (1904); Hill v. Memphis Hotel Co., 124 Tenn. 376, 136 S.W. 997, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 52, 34 L.R.A.

       Where traveler gives porter his baggage intending to become guest but does not, innkeeper does not become a bailee, though the porter deposits the grips or suitcases in the hotel office, without notice to the clerk or other employee of the hotel, and without their knowledge.

       An inn is a house of entertainment for travelers, and an innkeeper is a person who publicly professes that he keeps an inn, and that he will receive therein all travelers who promise to pay an adequate price, and who come in a situation or condition fit to be received. Hill v. Memphis Hotel Co., 124 Tenn. 376, 136 S.W. 997, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 52, 34 L.R.A. (n.s.) 420 (1911).

      <p>
       The term “hotel” is properly applied to places kept for the entertainment of travelers and casual or transient guests. McClaugherty v. Cline, 128 Tenn. 605, 163 S.W. 801, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “innkeeper” and “hotel keeper” are synonymous, but each is distinct from a “boardinghouse keeper,” in that the innkeeper has no right to select his guests, but must receive every one applying for accommodation who conducts himself in a proper manner, while the keeper of a boardinghouse is one who maintains a house for the accommodation of those who enter under contract for entertainment at a certain rate for a certain period at an agreed compensation.

      <p>
       A traveler, who is received and entertained as such by the innkeeper, is a guest; but a person who comes, upon a special contract, to board and sojourn at an inn, is not a guest in the sense of the law, but is a boarder. So, a neighbor or friend, who comes to an inn on the invitation of the innkeeper, is not deemed a guest. Manning v. Wells, 28 Tenn. 746, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1849).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is a boarder, and not a guest, who, for the purpose of entertaining a visitor, removes from a boardinghouse to a hotel in the same city, and takes rooms in the quarters allotted to regular boarders for himself, family, and such visitor, for two or three weeks, at a special rate less than that charged transient guests. Meacham v. Galloway, 102 Tenn. 415, 52 S.W. 859, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 63, 73 Am. St. Rep. 886, <cite class="lra">46 L.R.A. 319</cite> (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       A boardinghouse does not cease to be such because transients are occasionally entertained; nor does a hotel lose its character as such merely because, incidentally, it entertains boarders under contract for compensation for a specified time.

       As part of the rules promulgated pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall develop uniform terminology to describe the types of metal most commonly sold as scrap. The commissioner may appoint a committee to develop the uniform terminology. The committee shall consist of at least five (5) members but no more than seven (7) members with at least one (1) member selected from each of the following groups: the scrap metal industry, the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police, the Tennessee Sheriffs' Association, the Home Builders Association of Tennessee and a member of the public who is not engaged in law enforcement, the scrap metal industry or the home building industry. The purpose of uniform terminology is to increase the chances of locating and recovering stolen scrap metal by enabling law enforcement officials to describe the stolen metal in their theft report in the same terms as the scrap metal industry uses to describe the same metal when it is brought in for sale.

         Where seller informed plaintiff broker that his farm was for sale on certain terms to anyone, but there was no express contract of employment with broker and where seller specifically disavowed any obligation to pay commissions, the court found that plaintiff was not seller's broker and that seller had no implied liability for commissions.

         Trial court properly granted a seller and a licensed affiliate broker summary judgment because the broker did not have knowledge of “adverse facts” within the meaning of the Tennessee Residential Property Disclosure Act and the Tennessee Real Estate Broker License Act of 1973; nothing in the record created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the broker knew that a cabin had been left vacant without a roof, doors, windows, or a deck or was otherwise exposed to the elements. Haynes v. Lunsford, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 69 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 2, 2017).

        <p>
         Because buyers generally alleged that a seller and a licensed affiliate broker breached their duty owed to the buyers by failing to disclose all material facts as to the actual condition of the home, and they did not mention either the Tennessee Real Estate Broker License Act of 1973 or the Tennessee Residential Property Disclosure Act in their complaint, the more comprehensive definition of “adverse facts” applied.

        The term “owner” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c13s62-13-104" target="_self">62-13-104</a></cite>(a)(1)(A), include corporations, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, or other business entities because the context makes clear that “owner” refers to a “person” who owns or leases real estate, and for purposes of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c13s62-13-104" target="_self">62-13-104</a></cite> “person” is defined as “any natural person, corporation, company, partnership, firm or association.” Business entities other than corporations, such as limited liability companies and partnership, do not qualify for the “corporate exemption” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c13s62-13-104ol1a1F" target="_self">62-13-104(a)(1)(F)</a></cite>. They qualify, if at all, only for the “owner exemption” provided for in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c13s62-13-104ol1a1A" target="_self">62-13-104(a)(1)(A)</a></cite>. Furthermore, a corporate entity that owns less than 100% of a particular property is exempt from the broker license requirement only with respect to activities involving the specific portion of the property it owns. The license requirement would apply to any actions involving the property as a whole or specific parts of the property that the corporate entity did not own. A lessee of property is an “owner” of real estate who may qualify for the “owner exemption,” but only with respect to the lessee's ownership interest in the lease, not with respect to the entire property. Furthermore, an individual or entity who owns a percentage of a limited liability company, which in turn owns 100% of a piece of real estate, does not qualify for the “owner exemption.” OAG 19-15, 2019 Tenn.

The payment or reassignment to the original judgment creditor shall not subject the account to further liability for payment to the original judgment creditor based on that transaction or judgment. Any costs incurred by the commission in attempting to collect judgments shall be paid from the account.

           A real estate licensee may provide real estate services to any party in a prospective transaction, with or without an agency relationship to one (1) or more parties to the transaction. Until such time as a licensee enters into a specific written agreement to establish an agency relationship with one (1) or more parties to a transaction, the licensee shall be considered a facilitator and shall not be considered an agent or advocate of any party to the transaction. An agency or subagency relationship shall not be assumed, implied or created without a written bilateral agreement that establishes the terms and conditions of the agency or subagency relationship. The negotiation and execution of either an exclusive agency listing agreement or an exclusive right to sell listing agreement with a prospective seller shall establish an agency relationship with the seller.

            A broker who, pursuant to a contract in writing entered into after October 1, 1997, has earned and is owed a fee or commission with respect to a lease or upon the exercise of an option for renewal or expansion of the lease, whether payable over time or in a lump sum, from the owner of commercial real estate pursuant to such written contract for the broker's services in connection with a lease of commercial real estate, shall have a cause of action to enforce the contract with respect to the fee or commission against a subsequent owner, even though the subsequent owner is not a party to the contract, if and only if the subsequent owner has notice of the contract as provided in this part with respect to the fee before obtaining title to the commercial real estate. There shall be no prohibition against a broker giving the notice as required by this part, and any such prohibition is void and unenforceable.

              Attorney General Opinions. In the definition of “practice of land surveying”, the term “drainage” refers to the components of a land drainage system, including storm and wastewater drainage, OAG 04-018, 2004 Tenn. AG LEXIS 18 (2/09/04).
             </p>
             <p>
              A licensed land surveyor who is not a registered engineer may not conduct and perform drainage design and calculations required for the construction of subdivisions, including determining the detention and retention of storm water as well as determining the size of ponds, basins, pipes and culverts which will hold and through which storm water will flow, OAG 04-018, 2004 Tenn.

             </p>
             <p>
              A city, in the exercise of its land planning authority, is not bound by the minimum standards governing the practice of land surveying and engineering; therefore, a city may require an engineer to perform functions that, arguably, may be performed by a land surveyor, OAG 04-018, 2004 Tenn.

              A professional land surveyor shall search the land records of the land to be surveyed filed in the register of deeds office and obtain the deeds of record of all the adjoining landowners as it pertains to the common boundaries. The professional land surveyor shall have the additional responsibility to utilize documents of public record or unrecorded documents or plats supplied to the surveyor at the time of the survey to resolve any discrepancies between the subject land and any adjoining lands. Evidence found from these sources shall be carefully compared with that located or found in the field survey in order to aid in the establishment of the original boundaries of the land being surveyed. It is not the intent of this section to require the professional land surveyor to research the title or encumbrances on the land involved.

               The general assembly finds that the competent and proper application of soil science principles by soil scientists is vital to the lives, property, economy, security, and environment of the people of this state. In order to safeguard life, health, and property and to promote the public welfare, the practice of soil science in this state is hereby declared to be subject to regulation in the public interest. Furthermore, the practice of soil science is hereby declared a learned profession to be practiced and regulated as such, and its practitioners in this state shall be held accountable to the state and members of the public by high professional standards in keeping with the ethics and practices of other learned professions in this state. The purpose of this part is to introduce additional qualifying criteria in a professional field at present only partially regulated, thereby benefiting the safety, health, and property of the people of Tennessee and promoting the public welfare. The fields of soil science expected to benefit are those related to the environment, soil classification and mapping, the inventory of the soil as a resource, basic soil science research, and other soil science matters of concern to the people of this state. This legislation does not attempt to infringe upon the current licensed professions of engineers, geologists, surveyors, or the persons who work directly for them as either their employees or as subcontractors. This legislation differentiates the principles of soil science from those respected and established fields.

A company that is owned and operated by licensed attorneys that obtains assignments of judgments for a fee from judgment creditors and that divides net proceeds collected on the judgments with the judgment creditors operates as a “collection service” within the meaning of the statute, OAG 00-105, 2000 Tenn.

      The term “notes” in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c20s62-20-102ol13" target="_self">62-20-102(3)</a></cite>, which exempts from the definition of “collection service” any person that engages in the “collection of notes or guarantees,” is best understood as encompassing only written promissory notes, i.e., unconditional written promises, signed by the maker, to pay absolutely and in any event a certain sum of money either to, or to the order of, the bearer or a designated person. When the Collection Services Board receives a complaint against a collection service licensee, it should inquire as to the nature of the underlying debt to make sure that is covered by the Tennessee Collection Services Act.

         Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the pest control operators on the homeowners' negligent misrepresentation and breach of warranty action relative to the issuance by the operators of a wood-destroying insect infestation inspection report; the warranty created by T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t62c21s62-21-202" target="_self">62-21-202</a></cite> was not available to the homeowners except under the limited conditions set forth in that statute, and no misrepresentation of fact had been made within the limited scope of statutory requirement in the wood-destroying insect infestation inspection report.

        Disputes which cannot be resolved between property owners, lenders, and/or trustees and persons issuing a wood destroying insect infestation inspection report may be resolved in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Prior to filing a suit for compensatory damages, the issuer of the report shall be given an opportunity to inspect the premises and to offer within thirty (30) days of such inspection a proposal for repair and treatment of the premises. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or rule to the contrary, if the property owner files suit prior to offering the issuer of the report an opportunity to inspect and propose repairs and treatments as required by this section, the issuer of the report shall have, in addition to the thirty (30) days in which to answer the complaint as provided in Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12, another thirty (30) days from the service of the summons and complaint within which to inspect and propose repairs and treatments before being required to answer the complaint. No property owner or lender shall be required to engage in an alternate dispute resolution process before filing a suit for compensatory damages.

        Attorney General Opinions. The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

        Attorney General Opinions. The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

      Attorney General Opinions. The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

       Private security guards are authorized to enforce local and state laws and to protect persons and property against general criminal activities, whether the guard is a private citizen or an off-duty police officer. White v. Revco Discount Drug Ctrs., Inc., 33 S.W.3d 713, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 650 (Tenn. 2000), rehearing denied, White v. Revco Disc. Drug Ctr., Inc., 37 S.W.3d 885, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 508 (Tenn. 2001).

       Trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress because the seizure of defendant's cell phone by a private security guard, licensed by the State did not constitute state action in violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, as the intent of the security guard was to identify the owner of the phone, the security guard was not endowed by law with plenary police powers such that he was a de facto police officer, and the choice of private establishments to use private security guards was not an affirmative action by the State to control, designate, or direct private security guards to act in a certain way in the course of their employment.

      Attorney General Opinions. The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

      The Eligibility Verification for Entitlements Act (EVEA) can be read in harmony with laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens or resident aliens and therefore did not impliedly repeal those laws. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens also violate the Equal Protection Clause because they discriminate based on alienage and would not satisfy strict scrutiny. State laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens are preempted to the extent they conflict with a federal law that limits States’ authority to determine alien eligibility for state public benefits, including professional and commercial licenses. Laws requiring licensure applicants to be U.S. citizens or resident aliens do not violate the Equal Protection Clause, however, because they discriminate only against unlawful aliens and lawful aliens who are not permanent residents. Those categories of aliens are not a suspect class, and the laws at issue would likely satisfy rational basis review. The Department of Commerce and Insurance is not required to enforce the requirements that an applicant for licensure, registration, or certification be a “citizen of the United States” or a “citizen of the United States or resident alien.” OAG 18-42, 2018 Tenn.

The commissioner of commerce and insurance is free to consider a National Rifle Association certificate in deciding whether an applicant is “personally qualified to conduct the training” of security guards; however, such a certificate is merely one aspect of this decision and the commissioner may look at all the material included with the individual's application and conclude that, based on all the experience the individual is personally qualified to conduct the training required under the statute, OAG 01-163, 2001 Tenn.

        Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics expressly state that an appraiser may not serve more than one client with regards to either an appraisal of the same property or “with respect to the same legal action” unless all parties consent to the dual representation. The appraiser could not continue his employment for general purposes with debtors and at the same time testify for the creditor on its motion for relief, which was unequivocally an interest adverse to debtors; accordingly, the appraiser was disqualified as the creditor's expert witness regarding its motion.

        Because a land consultant was not a licensed appraiser, he was not legally qualified to give an appraisal of property; however, the fact that the consultant could not appraise property did not automatically disqualify him from rendering an opinion as to the value of property, and although he could not appraise the property at issue, the fact he was not a licensed appraiser did not render him incompetent to render an opinion as to the value of the property.

          Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics expressly state that an appraiser may not serve more than one client with regards to either an appraisal of the same property or “with respect to the same legal action” unless all parties consent to the dual representation. The appraiser could not continue his employment for general purposes with debtors and at the same time testify for the creditor on its motion for relief, which was unequivocally an interest adverse to debtors; accordingly, the appraiser was disqualified as the creditor's expert witness regarding its motion.
