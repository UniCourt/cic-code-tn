         In wife's action as intervenor to recover proceeds from sale of racing mare which she alleged her husband had given her, all testimony relative to conversations and transaction between the husband and wife, not in presence of third person, was inadmissible while evidence as to ownership and possession of the mare, amounting to mere statements of fact, was admissible.

        <p>
         Proof of the execution of a written agreement between husband and wife, both having died since the agreement, could not be supplied by testimony relating to statements made by the wife while not in the husband's presence since not only is this testimony hearsay but also it violates the rule that neither husband nor wife is competent to testify to matters occurring by virtue of, or in consequence of the marital relation and as the wife would therefore, be incompetent so are those to whom she made the statement.

         Act qualifying husband and wife as competent witnesses for and against each other in civil actions, notwithstanding their marriage relation, with the exception of matters occurring between them by virtue of or in consequence of their marriage relation, is in effect a declaration that the general rule of incompetency as established by the common law shall remain and continue to be the rule in criminal cases against the one spouse when the other is offered as a witness.

         Because defendant's telephone call to spouse seeking a ride in the early morning hours was not intended to be confidential, the trial court correctly ruled that it was not privileged. State v. Price, 46 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 597 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Feb. 26, 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because defendant was on a public street when first seen by spouse wearing bloody clothing, the incident could not be described as “originating in a confidence,” and therefore, no privilege attached. State v. Price, 46 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 597 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Feb. 26, 2001).
        </p>

         Because there was no eyewitness to the murder and there was evidence that the defendant's marriage was already failing, the testimony of defendant's spouse offered a significant benefit to the trial of fact, a greater benefit than any injury to the marriage caused thereby. State v. Price, 46 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 597 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Feb. 26, 2001).

         By telling the jury that defendant's wife had previously testified against him, but that she could not be compelled to testify at trial, the prosecutor invited an inference that her prior testimony was unfavorable to defendant and that he was claiming the marital privilege to suppress her incriminating testimony; therefore, commenting on the privilege was improper.

         In a suit against an executor to recover the amount of a note having been collected by him before the death of his testator, testimony of executor's wife that the defendant paid the amount to testator was admissible since information was not derived from the marital relation but was testimony to a fact arrived at as any third person might.

         Where wife who was separated from her husband testified against him in a trial for armed robbery as state's witness, privileged communication between spouses was inapplicable as husband was not aware of her surveillance until she asked him what he was doing and the actions of defendant observed by wife could have been equally observed by general public.

         In a murder case, defendant's wife's testimony pertaining to the alleged crime should not have been excluded by the trial court, because the marriage was over, as the parties were separated, the wife harbored no desire for a reconciliation, and, at the time of the trial court's ruling, the only reason that the wife had not filed for a divorce was lack of money.

         In a felony murder case, spousal privilege was not violated by admitting a letter written by defendant to his wife, where, given that the marriage was irretrievably damaged, there was no risk of injury to it by disclosure of the communication to be balanced against the benefit from correct disposal of the prosecution; and the testimony of defendant's wife offered a significant benefit to the trier of fact, a greater benefit than any injury caused thereby.

        It is not lawful for any party to any action, suit, or proceeding to testify as to any transaction or conversation with, or statement by, any opposite party in interest, if such opposite party is incapacitated or disqualified to testify thereto, by reason of idiocy, lunacy, or insanity, unless called by the opposite side, and then only in the discretion of the court; provided, if a corporation be a party, this disqualification shall extend to its officers of every grade and its directors.

         In an age discrimination suit, the jury's verdict in favor of plaintiff was vacated because the admission of hearsay testimony was not harmless as if the out-of-court statements were excluded, plaintiff would have had only circumstantial evidence as a basis for his claim and could not have met his burden of proof to show that the proffered reason was pretextual.

         The statute was primarily intended to provide against the testimony of the living against the dead. Death having silenced the one, the law silences the other, the theory being that both or neither must be competent to testify. McDonald v. Allen, 67 Tenn. 446, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 397 (1874); Bingham v. Lavender, 70 Tenn. 48, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 186 (1878); D'Armond v. Baker, 10 Tenn. App. 28, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928); Baker v. Baker, 24 Tenn.

         The purpose of this section is to prevent the surviving party from having the benefit of his own testimony, when, by the death of his adversary, his representative was deprived of the decedent's version of the transaction or the statement.

         In a wrongful death case, the Dead Man's Statue did not apply because the estate had no interest in the outcome; because a deceased patient had no surviving spouse, the interest in the litigation passed to his minor son. Although the action was brought in the name of the personal representative, it was brought on behalf of the next of kin. Choate ex rel. Clayton C. v. Vanderbilt Univ., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn.

         This statute cannot be extended by the courts to cases not within its terms, upon the idea that they fall within the evil which was intended to be guarded against. As an exception, it must be strictly construed as against the exclusion of the testimony, and in favor of its admission. Hughlett v. Conner, 59 Tenn. 83, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1873); Fuqua v.

         Where suit against defendant's deceased agent was dismissed with prejudice, admission of evidence of conversations between the deceased agent and plaintiff was proper since the decedent's estate was no longer a party to the lawsuit, and this statute cannot be extended to cases not within its terms.

         Two things must concur to bring a case within the operation of this statute, and authorize the rejection of the evidence, namely (1) the proposed witness must be a party to the suit in such way that judgment may be rendered for or against him, and (2) the subject matter of his testimony must be concerning some “transaction with or statement by the testator, intestate, or ward.” Montague v. Thomason, 91 Tenn. 168, 18 S.W. 264, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 90 (1892); Leffew v. Mayes, 685 S.W.2d 288, 1984 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3055 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section contemplates those cases “wherein judgment may be rendered for the representative party and against the proposed witness, or vice versa. It does not comprehend a case wherein no judgment could be rendered either for or against the one called upon to testify, even though a judgment might be rendered for or against the personal representative.” Bernard v. Reaves, 27 Tenn. App. 121, 178 S.W.2d 224, 1943 Tenn. App. LEXIS 155 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943).

        <p>
         The competency of a witness under this section does not turn on whether the action is in tort or ex contractu but on whether in a given case the proffered testimony relates to a “transaction with or a statement by the deceased.” Christofiel v.

        <p>
         To render a party incompetent as a witness against the personal representative, it is not necessary that he should be an “opposite party” formally on the record, for, though a party be on the same side of the record with the personal representative, if his interest be antagonistic to that of the personal representative against whom he is called to testify, he will be incompetent. But, regardless of his formal position as a party on the record, if his interest is not antagonistic to the personal representative, he is a competent witness against the representative. Trabue, Davis & Co. v. Turner, 57 Tenn. 447, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 437 (1873); Hudgins v. Fanning, 63 Tenn. 574, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 307 (1874); Fuqua v. Dinwiddie, 74 Tenn. 645, 1881 Tenn.

         Transactions with an intestate must have reference to things done in intestate's presence, to which he might testify from his own personal knowledge, and not to things done outside his presence and hearing, though affecting liability of his estate. Waggoner v. Dorris, 17 Tenn. App. 420, 68 S.W.2d 142, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 76 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

         Even in tort actions there can be a “transaction” falling within the provisions of this section. Christofiel v. Johnson, 40 Tenn. App. 197, 290 S.W.2d 215, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         Not everything pertaining to an action ex contractu is a “transaction” in the sense of this section. Christofiel v. Johnson, 40 Tenn. App. 197, 290 S.W.2d 215, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).

         This section was inapplicable to suit by creditor of estate against administratrix where novation resulted from creditor's refraining to file claim against estate within the period provided by § 30-513 (now § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.30.html#t30c02s30-2-310" target="_blank">30-2-310</a></cite>) in reliance on administratrix' promise to personally pay claim so that suit was against administratrix personally on the new contract and not against the estate.

         The maker of a note to a partner in whose name the firm business was done, when sued on by the surviving partners, to whom the note had passed by operation of law, might testify as to a payment to the deceased partner; and the fact that one of the surviving partners, as executor of the deceased partner, was joined as a complainant was immaterial, since this statute contemplates only proper and necessary parties to the record, and such executor was only a nominal and unneccessary party.

         This statute was never intended to deprive litigants of the testimony of nominal but disinterested parties, nor, for stronger reason, of parties whose interests are the same as, or not antagonistic to, those against whom they are called to testify; as, a vendee of land is a competent witness to prove an oral contract between his vendor and his deceased mortgagee, that the vendor's equitable lien should be superior to the mortgage, in a suit by the personal representative of the vendor against the vendee and the personal representative of the deceased mortgagee to enforce such lien.

         In suit by an administrator to subject realty, now claimed by defendant but formerly belonging to decedent's judgment debtor, to satisfaction of the judgment, testimony of defendant relating to transactions with such judgment debtor, now deceased, is competent.

        </p>
        <p>
         In an action against an administrator, the complainant is competent to prove his possession of a letter to himself from the deceased, which he offers in evidence, and that it is in the handwriting of the deceased. These facts do not constitute “transactions with, or statements by,” the deceased. They are independent facts which may be proved by either party to the suit. Minnis v.

         The statute does not make the surviving party wholly incompetent; it only excludes his testimony respecting transactions with or statements by the person deceased. Minnis v. Abrams, 105 Tenn. 662, 58 S.W. 645, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 120, 80 Am. St. Rep. 913 (1900).

         This section prevents a “party” to a suit by or against the representative of a decedent from testifying to a transaction with or a statement by the decedent, but it does not prevent other witnesses from testifying to such a transaction or statement. Therefore a bank cashier in suit by bank against administratrix on note executed by decedent could testify to decedent's statement as to making a new note, and the fact that cashier was a stockholder and had handled the transaction as agent for plaintiff did not disqualify him to testify to such transaction or statement by decedent.

        <p>
         Where one party takes the deposition of an “opposite party” touching “transactions with or statements by the testator or intestate,” this constitutes an irrevocable call to testify thereto, “by the opposite party,” within the meaning of this statute, and the evidence thus elicited is admissible on behalf of either or both parties.

         The rule in Thomas v. Irvin, 90 Tenn. 512, 16 S.W. 1045, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 33 (1981), that where a defendant takes for use and not for discovery, and files a deposition of a plaintiff after examining him as to transactions and conversations he had with the testator, the defendant waives the Dead Man Statute and the evidence adduced becomes competent, is not inconsistent with the Tennessee discovery rules.

        </p>
        <p>
         A litigant would be penalized for utilizing discovery if, by the acquisition of information under the discovery rule, it would render incompetent evidence competent; therefore, the taking of discovery depositions does not necessarily render competent evidence otherwise incompetent under this section.

         The purpose of the law was to prevent the surviving party from having the benefit of his own testimony, when, by the death of his adversary, his representative was deprived of the decedent's version of the transaction or statement. Therefore, where a party dies after giving his deposition in a case, in which he deposed as to the transaction, the opposite party is competent to give his version of the transaction. McDonald v.

         In an action against executrix for services rendered testator, based on testator's promise to further compensate complainant, for her services, in his will, in which complainant testified on direct examination over defendant's exception as to such agreement, the mere fact that the defendant cross-examined her as to the agreement did not render her testimony as to testator's promise on reexamination competent, where otherwise incompetent.

         Continual objections made by administrator's counsel put the judge on notice that he was insisting on his rights to have plaintiff's testimony as to an agreement made between plaintiff and decedent excluded from the record under this section, and his cross-examination of plaintiff as to the agreement, after court had refrained from ruling on his objections, did not constitute a waiver of his rights under this section.

        Attorney General Opinions. Communications between an employee of a county sheriff's department and a volunteer clergy member, appointed by the sheriff to provide spirtual consultation, are confidential and privileged, provided the communications are made to the clergy member confidentially, in the clergy's professional capacity, according to the usual course of the clergy's practice or discipline, as established by the rules or customs of the clergy's religious organization or denomination when the employee is seeking spiritual advice or counseling; however, this privilege does not apply to any communication involving known or suspected child sexual abuse, OAG 01-009, 2001 Tenn.

         Communications made to a psychiatrist when the confidential relationship of psychiatrist and patient exists even though made in the presence of a spouse are privileged including any diagnosis made therefrom. Ellis v. Ellis, 63 Tenn. App. 361, 472 S.W.2d 741, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 225 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence during confidential communications to a psychiatrist of one sustaining such intimate family relationship as a spouse does not constitute the presence of a third party so as to void the confidential nature of the communications. Ellis v. Ellis, 63 Tenn. App. 361, 472 S.W.2d 741, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 225 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         While the parties themselves may testify in a divorce proceeding as to statements made by the other spouse while both were in the presence of a psychiatrist and a confidential relationship between psychiatrist and patient existed, the psychiatrist cannot divulge the privileged communications whether it be the actual conversations or diagnosis drawn therefrom unless the patient waives the privilege or the communications fall within some exception to the privilege. Ellis v. Ellis, 63 Tenn. App. 361, 472 S.W.2d 741, 1971 Tenn. App. LEXIS 225 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1971).

         Where defendant in a burglary and assault and battery case sought discovery of the prosecutrix-victim's hospital records on the grounds that these records would establish that she suffered from hallucinations or delusions; and other factors pointed to defendant's innocence, clearly the mental condition of prosecutrix was an issue in this case under exception (1) to the psychiatrist-patient privilege; and even more clearly the interests of justice required that the privilege be withheld under exception (2). State v. Brown, 552 S.W.2d 383, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 513 (Tenn. 1977).

         Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying an ex-husband's motion for a mistrial because the ex-husband received relevant information from his witness, the psychiatrist who had his ex-wife as a patient, and he could not force the witness to testify about privileged information; even without the privileged information, the witness provided information relevant to the case.

        <p>
         In Tennessee, authorizations to release medical information to third parties are a waiver of the privilege, but only to the extent of any disclosure made; therefore, the patient's authorization to release medical information to a third party should not be contemplated by the patient as release of all information in the medical file. Kennedy v. Dermatology Assocs., P.C., 183 F.R.D. 619, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5828 (E.D. Tenn. 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because the communications with the paramedics were not protected the psychiatrist/patient privilege where (1) as soon as the paramedics understood that defendant was incriminating herself, they stopped her, (2) the police officers present took appropriate action to ensure defendant was not questioned until she was advised of her rights, and (3) defendant was given a thorough Miranda warning before she signed the waiver and gave her recorded statement. State v. Polochak, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 35 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 16, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. LEXIS 396 (Tenn. May 14, 2015).

         Since the privilege does not apply in proceedings in which the patient raises the issue of the patient's mental or emotional condition, the exception to the privilege clearly controlled when the plaintiff sought damages for emotional distress, thereby raising the issue of plaintiff's mental and emotional condition. Kirchner v. Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc., 184 F.R.D. 124, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20241 (M.D. Tenn. 1998).

         Supreme court considered the substance of the questions presented concerning the exception to the news media shield law because the issue remained unresolved since the trial court had not yet ruled on the media's motion for summary judgment; in the absence of any ruling by the trial court, due to the district attorney's status as a public official, actual malice remained relevant, and the district attorney's request for discovery of information regarding actual malice was ripe for resolution. Funk v. Scripps Media, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Mar. 13, 2019).

         </span>
        </h4>
        <p>
         Fair report privilege is a defense based upon the source of the allegedly defamatory information, and as such, the assertion of this defense triggers the exception to the news media shield law; the statute uses “source” in a broad manner that includes official actions or proceedings. Funk v. Scripps Media, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Mar. 13, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court erred by granting a district attorney's motion to compel because the fair report privilege was a defense that rendered the source of the alleged defamatory statements unprotected by the news media shield law; the media disclosed the circumstances of the judicial proceeding where the allegedly defamatory statements originated, and thus, the trial court could not order them to disclose the information obtained from sources unless the district attorney satisfied the three-party test. Funk v. Scripps Media, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Mar. 13, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Assertion of the fair report privilege will necessarily entail disclosure of the media defendant's source of information; this is because a media defendant asserting the privilege must show that the allegedly defamatory information is a fair and accurate report of official actions or proceedings, and therefore, the media defendant must disclose the source of the allegedly defamatory information. Funk v. Scripps Media, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Mar. 13, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Source is the means by which a reporter obtains information, but information is what the reporter learned from the interview or the document; thus, the exception to the news media shield law allows a court to compel disclosure of the source of a media defendant's information, how media defendants know something; it does not authorize a court to compel media defendants to disclose the information the source provided. Funk v. Scripps Media, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Mar. 13, 2019).

         Defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failure to object to the use of only one interpreter for the victim (a deaf mute), and for failure to hire a second interpreter from funds available through the public defender's office.

         Discrimination claim of a man, who was both hearing-impaired and mute, stemming from the lack of an interpreter at his dispositional hearing was summarily dismissed because, although T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c01s24-1-211" target="_self">24-1-211</a></cite> requires that a qualified interpreter be present when a deaf person is the subject of court proceedings, the man's attorney, knowing that no interpreter was available, elected to keep the court date in order to enter a plea agreement, and enlisted the help of the man's mother as an interpreter.

       The witness may be discharged by the party at whose instance he was summoned; and his telling the witness that he need not attend, unless convenient, and that, if not present at the trial, he should not be called out, operates to discharge the witness, so that he does not incur the penalty for nonattendance.

       Where on day witness was summoned to appear the court granted an indefinite continuance of the case and thereafter a new trial date was set, a letter written by the solicitors for the complainants to such witness telling him when the case was set for trial did not amount to a legal notice and therefore such witness could not be punished for contempt for not appearing on such date.

       The judgment nisi must show by direct averment the time of the service of the subpoena, and the time of the trial, and that the defendant was bound to attend at that time. State v. Lacy, 22 Tenn. 225, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1842).
      </p>
      <p>
       The judgment nisi must assume every fact necessary to be proved in order to constitute the defendant's liability, and must embody such statement of facts as will show directly and certainly, and not by mere inference, the legal ground of the witness' liability to the penalty. The scire facias should follow the judgment nisi, and recite all the facts assumed and embodied therein. State v. Lacy, 22 Tenn. 225, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1842); Dickenson v. Kincaid, 30 Tenn. 72, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1850); Knott v. Smith, 34 Tenn. 244, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1854).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment nisi and the scire facias issued therefrom must both show when the witness was summoned and whether the subpoena issued in vacation or instanter during the term, and if it fails to do this, the defendant may defeat the proceeding by a plea of nul tiel record to the scire facias. Dickenson v. Kincaid, 30 Tenn. 72, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment nisi is essential to the validity of a proceeding by scire facias to recover the statutory penalty of a defaulting witness, and the want of it is not waived by appearance and defense on the merits. Rogers v. Goins, 95 Tenn. 361, 32 S.W. 197, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 99 (1895).

       The scire facias to recover the penalty for a failure to attend need only set out the subpoena substantially, because it is in the nature of a record. Smith v. Barger, 17 Tenn. 322, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1836).

       Witness could be excused from attending for physical incapacity, high water and the like. Duke v. Given, 12 Tenn. 478, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1833).

       Under Acts 1794, ch. 1, § 29 authorizing excuse for nonattendance because of “incapacity to attend” the incapacity was held to be limited to a personal incapacity of the witness himself. Slaughter v. Birdwell, 38 Tenn. 341, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 186 (1858).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section as carried forward into the Code of 1858 relieves the witness from forfeiture upon “sufficient cause” for failing to attend and so it was a good defense that the wife of the witness was so seriously ill as to need his attention at home.

       No witness shall prove personal attendance in more than four (4) suits where one (1) of the parties is the same or the question to be tried is the same; provided, that this shall apply only to the term where the witness actually testifies in such suits. At all other terms where such witness does not actually testify, the witness shall be allowed to prove attendance in only two (2) of such suits; provided, that in any event such witness shall claim mileage and ferriage in only one (1) of such suits.

        A strict compliance with the requirements of the statute as to proof of attendance by witnesses as a prerequisite to the taxing of costs is essential to a valid allowance of witness fees and mileage. King v. State, 170 Tenn. 236, 94 S.W.2d 383, 1936 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1936).

       </h4>
       <p>
        Witnesses, attending without being legally subpoenaed, are not entitled to prove their attendance and have it taxed in the bill of costs, but must look, for their compensation, to the party requesting their attendance as witnesses. Hopkins v. Waterhouse, 10 Tenn. 230, 1828 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1828); Moore v. McLemore, 2 Shan. 160 (1876); Lancaster v. State, 71 Tenn. 652, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the attendance has been proved, the presumption is that the witness was subpoenaed, although the process cannot be found. But if the court is satisfied that he was not subpoenaed, his costs should be stricken. A memorandum of the attendance of witnesses, kept by the clerk, may, it seems, be looked to by the court. Hopkins v. Waterhouse, 10 Tenn. 323, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1829); Burson v. Mahoney & Shipley, 65 Tenn. 304, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 351 (1873); Moore v. McLemore, 2 Shan. 160 (1876).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that there is no subpoena on file is not conclusive evidence that the witness has not been summoned. Moore v. McLemore, 2 Shan. 160 (1876).

        A witness is entitled to prove his attendance, although he was a party to another suit, which would, of itself, have compelled him to attend court. Hopkins v. Waterhouse, 10 Tenn. 323, 1829 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1829).

        Incompetent witness is entitled to his attendance, if examined, and when paid, it cannot be recovered from him upon retaxation of costs striking the item paid, merely because the record showed him to be an incompetent witness. Gray v. Alexander, 26 Tenn. 16, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 37 (1846).

        While a subpoenaed witness cannot demand his fees and expenses to be paid in advance, he can maintain an action against the party, at whose instance he was summoned, for his compensation as allowed by law, at the end of each term, without waiting till the termination of the cause; but the clerk cannot sue for his fees before the termination of the cause. The suit of the witness may be before any tribunal having jurisdiction of the amount; but the suit is not on the bond, but for his attendance. Wetherspoon v. Killough, 8 Tenn. 38, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1827); Smith v. Barger, 17 Tenn. 322, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 54 (1836); Burson v. Mahoney & Shipley, 65 Tenn. 304, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 351 (1873).

       <p>
        Where probate of attendance of witnesses was not taken until after final decision of case and after the filing of defendant's motion to retax the costs for failure to so probate attendance of witnesses, the circuit court erred in overruling defendant's motion to retax the costs as the clerk is without authority to probate attendance of witnesses after the final decision of the case.

       Whenever a party in a court of record recovers a judgment or decree against another for costs, and it appears from the return of the execution that such costs cannot be made out of the person against whom they have been adjudged, the witnesses summoned by the successful party may have judgment by motion against such party for their costs.

       Settlements of an administrator or guardian, made with the clerk ex parte, without notice to the parties interested in the estate, or without their appearance, are, at most, only prima facie evidence in his favor, when impeached by a bill attacking them and seeking an account. Hammond v. Beasley, 83 Tenn. 618, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1885); Murray v. Luna, 86 Tenn. 326, 6 S.W. 603, 1887 Tenn. LEXIS 49 (1887); Henley v. Robb, 86 Tenn. 474, 7 S.W. 190, 1887 Tenn.

       Where settlement was not attached until many years afterwards and after the death of the executor and, apparently, of all others having personal knowledge of the facts, the settlement should be deemed prima facie correct, though the record does not affirmatively show that notice was given.

      <p>
       Under statute providing that settlements of guardians are to be taken as prima facie correct where made in county court in pursuance of law, there can be no distinction between an annual settlement and a final settlement with respect to the method by which they may be attacked.

       This statute was intended to afford the creditor an easy and cheap mode of collecting his debt, when it was justly due and no real defense existed, and to put accounts from another county or state, duly sworn to and certified, upon the footing of written contracts constituting the foundation of an action, as under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c05s24-5-104ol1repealed" target="_self">24-5-104 (repealed)</a></cite> and to enable the plaintiff, in such case, to have judgment without further proof, unless the defendant should deny the account on oath, and thus give him notice that he must be prepared to prove the correctness of the account.

       The declaration must aver that the account is from another county or state, verified as provided, and make profert of it, in order to make it incumbent on the defendant to deny it under oath; and where this is done, the defendant must file his denial under oath, with his plea, if he contests the account. This course prevents surprise to either party on the trial. Hunter v. Anderson, 48 Tenn. 1, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1870); Wilkhorn v. Gillespie, 53 Tenn. 329, 1871 Tenn.

      <p>
       In a suit before a justice, upon a proved account coming from another county or state, it should be stated in the warrant, or otherwise made to appear, that the suit is upon such account. It was held that it “otherwise” appeared where the warrant was in the usual form on an ordinary account, and without more, and the proved account was merely attached to the warrant. Wilkhorn v. Gillespie, 53 Tenn. 329, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 367 (1871), overruled, Williams v. Lenoir, 67 Tenn. 395, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1875); Jenkins v. Southern Lumber Co., 3 Tenn. App. 605, 1926 Tenn.

       Though the bill did not expressly state that the suit was on a sworn account coming from another state, it was sufficient and required a denial under oath, before evidence to impeach it was admissible, where a reading of the bill and exhibits should have put anyone on notice that the suit was upon sworn account coming from another state.

       Appellant entered a general denial with her answer that was accepted by the trial court and was effective insofar as the trial court recognized her denial of the debt's validity, but she did not, however, assert a timely affirmative defense, and thus the trial court did not err by determining that appellant had waived any affirmative defense, including an assertion that the money transfers were gifts, by failing to plead it in her answer.

       If the account is unjust, the defendant may deny it on oath, and this will neutralize the effect of the plaintiff's oath, and make up an issue between them, and put the plaintiff to the proof of the account, as though it had not been sworn to under the statute. Cave & Shaffer v. Baskett, 22 Tenn. 340, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1842); Brien v. Peterman & Cope, 40 Tenn. 498, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1859); Cumberland Grocery Co. v. York, 9 Tenn. App. 316, 1929 Tenn.

       In an action upon an account coming from another state or another county of this state, properly proved in compliance with the statute, its correctness is not in issue unless it is denied under oath. Foster v. Scott County, 107 Tenn. 693, 65 S.W. 22, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1901).

      <p>
       Where the sworn account was filed with the declaration, and the denial under oath was made nearly 12 months thereafter, and only one day before the trial, and the plaintiff did not ask for a continuance on that account, but elected to go to trial, he was not entitled to a new trial on the ground of surprise. Brien v. Peterman & Cope, 40 Tenn. 498, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1859); Hunter v. Anderson, 48 Tenn. 1, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 1 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the defendant contests the proved account, he must make his denial on oath before the justice, in writing, as in cases where the plea of non est factum is relied upon, and if he fails to do so, and appeals, the affidavit of denial must be made and filed in the circuit court, at all events, before the submission of the case to the jury. Wilkhorn v. Gillespie, 53 Tenn. 329, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 367 (1871), overruled, Williams v. Lenoir, 67 Tenn. 395, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1875).

       Where several defendants are jointly sued, and they are jointly concerned, a sworn denial of the justice of the account, made by one of the defendants, if it go to the justice of the account as against all of the defendants, is as efficacious as if all had united in the denial. This suit was against the two personal representatives of a decedent, and the account was denied on oath by one of them. Brien v. Peterman & Cope, 40 Tenn. 498, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 142 (1859).

       The denial of the justice of an account, coming from another county or state, and proved as provided, contained in a sworn petition for a certiorari and supersedeas to take the case up from a justice to the circuit court, for a new trial, is such a denial under oath as to put the plaintiff to the proof of his account, in the circuit court, and to entitle the defendant to disprove it.

       Grant of summary judgment in favor of a credit card company in an action on a sworn account for unpaid credit card debt was appropriate because the company was not required to bring forth further proof of its claim; the properly authenticated and sworn account, without a proper response from the customer, was conclusive against him.

      <p>
       Regardless of whether appellees were required to comply with the statute on sworn accounts, it appeared that any purported error in failing to do so was corrected when the case was appealed de novo to the trial court because, once there, the trial court held a full evidentiary hearing in which appellees submitted their evidence, both documentary and testimonial, to support their claim, and the trial court found that evidence credible and persuasive; thus, any purported error in failing to comply with the statute on sworn accounts in the general sessions court was harmless.

       Where a prima facie case is established against a bailee by proof of delivery of goods to the bailee in good condition and proof of failure of bailee to redeliver or of redelivery in damaged condition, the prima facie case is not overcome by a showing on the part of the bailee that the goods have been burned or otherwise destroyed or have been stolen but such bailee must produce evidence that the burning, loss or theft was occasioned without his fault.

       In an interlocutory appeal, because it was undisputed that the total of respective medical bills of plaintiffs exceeded the statutory limit of $4,000, the trial court did not err in declining to apply the T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c05s24-5-113" target="_self">24-5-113</a></cite> presumption and striking the medical bills, in amounts of $3,977 and $3,968, attached to plaintiffs'  complaint; the court rejected plaintiffs'  argument that they could redact certain portions of medical bills in order to comport with the statute.

       Trial court did not err in finding an estate proved the reasonableness and necessity of hospital bills related to the amputation of the decedent's leg because a medical doctor testified the gangrene which necessitated the amputation of the decedent's leg was a natural progression of the foot wound the decedent suffered in an ambulance ride; the original injury to the decedent's left foot was what made the amputation necessary, the surgery done at the hospital to remove the left leg was “a surgical emergency,” and the doctor followed the decedent's recuperation in the hospital to achieve closure of the wound.

       After defendant moved for a directed verdict with respect to plaintiff's claim for medical expenses, the trial court erred by denying plaintiff's request to re-open the proof for the narrow purpose of allowing him to put his medical bills into evidence; therefore, it also erred in granting defendant a directed verdict.

       Because the claims made by patients were not personal injury claims against the persons who caused their injuries, and the amount of each claim exceeded $4,000, the appellate court had to assess the reasonableness of a hospital's charges without the presumption that they were reasonable.

       Matter to be determined by the jury with respect to appellant's medical bills was not whether the charges were incurred but the extent to which they were reasonable and necessary and caused by the accident; the jury's decision turned on the assessment of credibility and the jury's determination of the extent to which appellant's medical condition was caused by the accident, and there was material evidence to support the verdict in this case.

However, the remittance and acceptance of a check or other instrument bearing on its face words that it is payment or satisfaction in full of a debt or obligation shall not be considered conclusive evidence of an intention that the debt or obligation for which the same is given be discharged or released; provided, that the remittee of such instrument tenders back to the remittor the funds represented by such instrument.

       It is a sufficient consideration that the one released paid before demand his aliquot part of the debt which was accepted in full satisfaction of his liability, and that this situation was acquiesced in with full knowledge by all parties until the other makers, then solvent, had become utterly insolvent. First Nat'l Bank v. Shook, 100 Tenn. 436, 45 S.W. 338, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       A payment by a joint maker of his aliquot part of a note is sufficient consideration for his release. First Nat'l Bank v. Shook, 100 Tenn. 436, 45 S.W. 338, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1898); Miller v. Fox, 111 Tenn. 336, 76 S.W. 893, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The seals having been abolished, a release in writing is sufficient without a consideration. First Nat'l Bank v. Shook, 100 Tenn. 436, 45 S.W. 338, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1898); Tippett v. Shaw, 4 Tenn. App. 132, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 172 (1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       A release or discharge of a debt, in writing, without any new consideration passing, is valid, and will operate according to the intention of the parties. Miller v. Fox, 111 Tenn. 336, 76 S.W. 893, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       A verbal agreement of a landlord made during the term of a lease to accept a reduced rental without consideration is unenforceable. A consideration is necessary to support the modification, and the original rental sums for the remainder of the term may be recovered after acceptance of a lesser amount for the intervening periods. Winer v. Williams, 165 Tenn. 190, 54 S.W.2d 723, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1932).

       Where plaintiff released defendant from future negligence in the application of hair straightener, the services rendered in attempting to straighten the hair which subsequently fell out constituted adequate consideration to support the release. Dixon v. Manier, 545 S.W.2d 948, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976). But see Cocke v. Stuart, 7 Tenn. 136, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1823) noted in the bound volume.

       A release is the giving or discharging of a right of action which one has; but it cannot operate prospectively, so as to defeat an action the cause of which may arise in the future. Cocke v. Stuart, 7 Tenn. 136, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1823).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee public policy favors freedom to contract for release for future negligence. Dixon v. Manier, 545 S.W.2d 948, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976). But see Cocke v. Stuart, 7 Tenn. 136, 1823 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1823) noted in the bound volume.

       The language of a written release signed by complainant, being plain and unambiguous, it will be given effect according to the intention of the parties as plainly expressed therein, unvaried or not contradicted by parol testimony of the complainant as to his purposes or understanding to the contrary.

       Agreement which recited that payee assign all his rights, title and interest to note executed by defendant without prejudice in any manner to rights theretofore acquired by holder, as an innocent purchaser for value, did not upon entry of compromise order of settlement and dismissal as to payee assignor operate as a cancelation of note as to maker, since intent was manifested merely to effect an assignment of all interest of payee to the holder.

       Cashing of defendant's check which contained specified deductions did not constitute accord and satisfaction where plaintiff wrote it was not accepting check as full payment of account and defendant replied that it would welcome a conference on the matter of the deductions. B. Mifflin Hood Co. v. Lichter, 106 F. Supp. 220, 1950 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4281 (D. Tenn. 1950), aff'd, 198 F.2d 472, 1952 U.S. App. LEXIS 3194 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1952).

      <p>
       Where there has been no evidence that the creditor ever understood that the debt was in dispute and that the creditor ever agreed to take a lesser sum in payment of the full amount it was unrealistic for a debtor to send an installment payment to a creditor, and to have the balance of his debt deemed discharged as a master of law simply because of a legend the debtor placed thereon. Quality Care Nursing Services, Inc. v. Coleman, 728 S.W.2d 1, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 861 (Tenn. 1987).

       A release or discharge of a debt, without consideration, and not in a signed writing, is void. Miller v. Fox, 111 Tenn. 336, 76 S.W. 893, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The oral release of some of the joint obligors, upon the payment of a portion of the debt owed, after its maturity, without other consideration, is not binding, and all the obligors remain bound for the balance of the debt. Miller v. Fox, 111 Tenn. 336, 76 S.W. 893, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       An oral release is binding, if supported by a consideration; and a co-obligor will not be relieved thereby, if he consented to the release, and agreed to remain bound. The case also discusses the nature of the required consideration. Miller v. Fox, 111 Tenn. 336, 76 S.W. 893, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       A verbal agreement by a landlord during the term to accept a reduced rental sum without consideration is unenforceable. At the expiration of the term the landlord may recover the difference between the stipulated rent and the reduced rent that had been paid. Winer v. Williams, 165 Tenn. 190, 54 S.W.2d 723, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is generally held that where an agreement to reduce rent has been fully executed and a smaller rent paid and accepted in full during term of the lease no form of consideration is necessary. Haun v. Corkland, 55 Tenn. App. 292, 399 S.W.2d 518, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 256 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965). Commenting on Winer v. Williams, 165 Tenn. 190, 54 S.W.2d 723, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant entered lease agreement for $600 per month and thereafter because of loss of business, rent was reduced to $100 per week by oral agreement there was a consideration for such reduction in rent passing to the lessor because of the possibility that by so doing he kept the building occupied when otherwise he may have had an empty building in view of the depressed conditions, and a consideration also passed from the lessee in the form of inconvenience of making weekly instead of monthly payments. Haun v. Corkland, 55 Tenn. App. 292, 399 S.W.2d 518, 1965 Tenn. App. LEXIS 256 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1965).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Under this statute, where one of the obligors has been released, it is a question of intention to be determined from the terms of the release whether the effect was to release the other obligors wholly or only for the released obligor's aliquot proportion of the joint liability, or whether the unreleased obligors are still held for the whole joint liability. But the party seeking to enforce the liability against the unreleased obligors, either for the whole joint liability or only for the part remaining after deducting the aliquot proportion of the released obligor, must affirmatively show the liability in either degree, either by admissions of defendants or by some action or course of conduct equivalent thereto, or by the instrument of release to be interpreted by the court. The release of one joint obligor, without the consent or knowledge of the other obligors, and without their express or implied promise to pay the debt or their aliquot proportion of it, does not release them of their part where the expressed intention of the owner of the note, bond, or obligation was not to release them; but oral evidence is inadmissible to show an agreement not expressed in the writing not to release the other parties to the instrument or obligation. Evans v. Pigg, 43 Tenn. 395, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1866); Simpson v. Moore, 65 Tenn. 371, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 367 (1873); Richardson v. McLemore, 64 Tenn. 586, 1875 Tenn. LEXIS 132 (1875); Williams v.

       Where joint and several debtors agree each to pay one-half of the debt, the creditor, with knowledge of this agreement, by accepting one-half from one and releasing him does not release the other. The creditor but conformed to the intent and design of the debtors, the debt was by the debtors in effect several, each making his part his debt. Hamilton v. Ritchie, 53 S.W. 198, 1899 Tenn. Ch.

       This section changed the old technical rule of the common law, whereby the release of one co-obligor automatically released another co-obligor, so that since 1858 the law in Tennessee has been that the release of one co-obligor on a contractual debt does not release another co-obligor, unless the consequent release of the other is the intent of the parties to the release instrument.

       A release, upon sufficient consideration, and with the consent of the other interested parties, of one of several makers of a note, by merely erasing his signature, is valid and effectual without other writing. The statute relating to releases in writing has no application in such case. First Nat'l Bank v. Shook, 100 Tenn. 436, 45 S.W. 338, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 134 (1898); Miller v.

       A release of a railroad company from liability under contractual obligation to protect plaintiff, its employee, does not operate to release defendants, other employees, as to their intentional tort. The consideration paid for the release is not to be considered in mitigation of damages. Brimer v. Scheibel, 154 Tenn. 253, 290 S.W. 5, 1926 Tenn.

      <p>
       A misrepresentation, in order to be sufficient to avoid a contract of settlement, must be as to the material facts rather than mere matters of opinion, unless the relation of the parties is such as to render applicable certain well recognized exceptions to the rule, such as where there is a fiduciary relation existing between the parties. Chattanooga R. & L. Co. v. Glaze, 146 Tenn. 49, 239 S.W. 394, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for personal injuries, in which the defendant set up a contract of settlement, the evidence is stated and held to be insufficient to show that the settlement and release were procured by defendant's fraud.

       In the absence of fraud or duress, the failure of the plaintiff to read the release agreement is not a valid ground to declare the release void. Dixon v. Manier, 545 S.W.2d 948, 1976 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).

       An instrument executed by a person sustaining a personal injury inflicted by joint wrongdoers, whereby he agrees to dismiss the suit against one of them, and not to reinstitute it, and whereby he agrees to hold such wrongdoer harmless from all liability by reason of the accident, is a “covenant not to sue” such wrongdoer, and is not a satisfaction of the liability of the other wrongdoers, and judgment may be recovered against them. Smith v. Dixie Park & Amusement Co., 128 Tenn. 112, 157 S.W. 900, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1913); Nashville I. Ry. v. Gregory, 137 Tenn. 422, 193 S.W. 1053, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       A covenant by an injured person not to sue one of two joint tort-feasors, if not released does not reduce the liability of the other, and does not entitle the other to credit for the amount received for the covenant, because the consideration is not a satisfaction of the claim for damages, especially where it was expressly contracted that the sum received was not intended as a satisfaction of plaintiff's claim for damages, and the other tort-feasor would have no cross action against the one to whom the covenant was given. Nashville I. Ry. v. Gregory, 137 Tenn. 422, 193 S.W. 1053, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1917).

      <p>
       Where there is a covenant not to sue a part of joint wrongdoers in which instrument there is embodied a stipulation that it “may be pleaded as a defense in any action,” such stipulation operates to extinguish the cause of action and releases the joint tort-feasor. Byrd v. Crowder, 166 Tenn. 215, 60 S.W.2d 171, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (1933), superseded by statute as stated in, Kreutzmann v. Bauman, 609 S.W.2d 736, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 389 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).

       Instrument in judgment held not to be a release but a covenant not to sue, which did not extinguish the cause of action. Oliver v. Williams, 19 Tenn. App. 54, 83 S.W.2d 271, 1935 Tenn. App. LEXIS 20 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1935).

       Blood grouping tests made by qualified persons in laboratories located in this state for the purpose of exclusion of a person as an alleged parent are admissible in evidence but such tests should not be received in evidence without affording the parties involved an opportunity to examine the witness who made the tests as to his competency and as to the means employed by him and all other factors having to do with the reliability of such tests. Nicks v. Nicks, 51 Tenn. App. 520, 369 S.W.2d 909, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 124 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce suit where paternity of child born to wife was in issue action of trial court in concluding that husband was not the father was improper where blood test was made by out of state doctor and was not offered in evidence or presented by person preparing report as a witness or otherwise identified. Nicks v. Nicks, 51 Tenn. App. 520, 369 S.W.2d 909, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 124 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section requires that the demand for testing by either party must be made at the initial appearance of the demanding party in the juvenile court only if the issue of paternity is tried in the juvenile court. If it is transferred to the circuit court for trial, that court becomes “the court before whom the matter may be brought.” State ex rel. Overton v. Taylor, 786 S.W.2d 942, 1990 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (Tenn. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section establishes a procedure for requesting blood tests in the initial proceeding in which a party raises the issue of parentage; a contempt proceeding for failure to pay child support arises out of the order in a divorce and custody proceeding, and is not a separate and distinct proceeding in which a party can request a blood test.

       The trial judge is vested with wide latitude in setting up procedures to guarantee that blood testing will be conducted fairly, properly, and without fraud. Tennessee Dep't of Human Services v. Jones, 647 S.W.2d 942, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 446 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

       It was within the discretion of the trial judge to grant a motion to require a blood test that was filed subsequent to the mother's initial appearance. State ex rel. Scott v. Brown, 937 S.W.2d 934, 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 507 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court abused its discretion in allowing the husband in a divorce case to proceed on a post-decree petition challenging the paternity of the child for whom the husband had agreed to pay support, where the information causing the husband to doubt his paternity had been known to the husband for several years before he filed his petition, and the petition was brought almost 10 years after the divorce.

       The 1994 amendment, adding the conclusive presumption feature contained in subdivision (b)(2)(B), is procedural and could be applied retroactively. State ex rel. Scott v. Brown, 937 S.W.2d 934, 1996 Tenn. App. LEXIS 507 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).

      <p>
       Pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.36.html#t36c02s36-2-302" target="_blank">36-2-302</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-112" target="_self">24-7-112</a></cite>, the biological father was the legal father of the child, absent the termination of his rights, and a best-interests analysis was relevant if an only if termination was appropriate; the evidence did not support the arguments of the mother and her husband that the biological father willfully failed to visit or support the child, as the evidence showed that: (1) The mother actively concealed the child's parentage; and (2) The mother declined the biological father's offer of support. In re T.K.Y., 205 S.W.3d 343, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 757 (Tenn. 2006), rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 891 (Tenn. Sept. 19, 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the juvenile court erred in taking judicial notice of a paternity test report previously entered as an exhibit in proceedings before a magistrate, the error was harmless because the mother's copy of the report was admissible; because the report showed a statistical probability of paternity of ninety-nine percent or greater, the putative father had an extremely high burden of proof to rebut the statutory presumption of paternity, but he failed to meet that burden. In re Michael J., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 52 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2018).

       Trial court's narrow reading of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-113" target="_self">24-7-113</a></cite> to allow a man not related to the minor child (whose mother was incarcerated) to retain parental status he had obtained as a result of his voluntary acknowledgement of paternity was against public policy; limiting paternity challenges to the signatories to a voluntary acknowledgment would make that status virtually unassailable, even to the biological father. In re C.A.F., 114 S.W.3d 524, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-113" target="_self">24-7-113</a></cite> creates a mechanism for establishing paternity without the intervention of the court; its main purpose is to make it possible to decree child support orders without first having to go through a paternity proceeding. It was not meant to allow a non-parent to obtain parental rights over a child without having to go through an adoption proceeding. In re C.A.F., 114 S.W.3d 524, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 134 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of the putative father's rights to five children was appropriate because the record clearly and convincingly established that the Department of Children's Services used reasonable efforts to assist him in establishing his parentage of the children. When the DCS obtained the results of the genetic testing, it provided the results to the putative father and advised him to take the results to the juvenile court to establish his paternity, but the father was not successful; he did not testify that he informed the DCS that his efforts to establish his paternity had failed or that he requested further assistance from the DCS to accomplish that task. In re Bernard T., 319 S.W.3d 586,  2010 Tenn. LEXIS 683 (Tenn. Aug. 26, 2010).

       Although, in its 1994 amendment to the Vital Records Act of 1977, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.68.html#t68c03s68-3-305ol1b" target="_blank">68-3-305(b)</a></cite>, the Legislature did not use the specific term “voluntary acknowledgment of paternity” that it used in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-113" target="_self">24-7-113</a></cite>, the Legislature intended the “sworn acknowledgment” or “affidavit” contemplated in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.68.html#t68c03s68-3-305ol1b" target="_blank">68-3-305(b)</a></cite> to receive the legal status of a § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-113" target="_self">24-7-113</a></cite> voluntary acknowledgment of paternity.

       With the enactment of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-113" target="_self">24-7-113</a></cite>, the “affidavits” that had previously been executed under the Vital Records Act of 1977, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.68.html#t68c03s68-3-305ol1b" target="_blank">68-3-305(b)</a></cite>, are given the status of voluntary acknowledgments of paternity constituting a legal finding of paternity and are entitled to full faith and credit in any judicial proceeding. In re Estate of Davis, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 235 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly ruled that a child was an heir-at-law of the decedent, who died intestate, because the inclusion of the decedent's name on the child's birth certificate evinced the execution of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that constituted a legal finding of paternity; therefore, the child's portion of the estate vested in him immediately upon the decedent's death. In re Estate of Davis, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 235 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2016).

      <p>
       Trial court erred in denying a motion filed by a child's mother to set aside a settlement reached by the decedent's mother in an underlying wrongful death lawsuit, staying its proceedings, and transferring the paternity issue to the Probate Court because, while the decedent executed a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity in Mississippi, the court did not make the statutorily required findings concerning fraud, duress, or material mistake when the child's paternity was challenged, and the Probate Court had no authority to enroll the foreign acknowledgment of paternity under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act.

       Earlier cases to the contrary, since the enactment of this section in 1967, expert witnesses can testify as to their professional opinion and it is the responsibility of the trial judge to choose from conflicting opinions expressed by highly qualified and conscientious expert witnesses. Combustion Engineering, Inc. v. Kennedy, 562 S.W.2d 202, 1978 Tenn. LEXIS 585 (Tenn. 1978).
      </p>

       Under this section, the opinion of a qualified medical expert witness based on subjective findings alone is sufficient to establish medical causation and the permanency of disability, if the evidence is found to be credible by the trial judge.

       In workers' compensation case, the fact that there was no objective finding upon which physician could base a permanent partial disability rating did not render his testimony inadmissible; rather the fact that his opinion was based upon subjective findings alone affected only its weight.

       Although defendant's cell phone records were improperly introduced into evidence through a detective's testimony, the error was harmless because the phone records would not change the jury's verdict or affect the outcome of the trial as the records were introduced to refute the assertion that the victim called defendant in the middle of the night to invite him over to her aunt's house because the victim testified that she did not call defendant, that she did not have her own cell phone, and that there was not a landline at her aunt's house; the victim's aunt stated that she had taken her own cell phone with her on her trip; and the victim's uncle testified that the victim had no access to a phone on the night of the incident.

       Evidence of DNA analysis is admissible upon a showing that the evidence otherwise meets the standards of admissibility set forth in the Tennessee Rules of Evidence. State v. Scott, 33 S.W.3d 746, 2000 Tenn. LEXIS 682 (Tenn. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because DNA evidence is statutorily regarded as trustworthy and reliable, DNA evidence is exempted from the trial court's determination under Tenn. R. Evid. 703 of whether DNA analysis provides a trustworthy and reliable method of identifying characteristics in an individual's genetic material. State v. Spratt, 31 S.W.3d 587, 2000 Tenn. Crim.

       T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-118" target="_self">24-7-118</a></cite> effectively exempts DNA evidence from the reliability and trustworthiness inquiry required by Tenn. R.

      <p>
       DNA testing evidence “substantially assisted” the trier of fact, despite that the testing excluded neither the defendant nor the victim, where it did conclusively exclude codefendant and the defense's theory was that the codefendant attacked and killed the victim. State v. Price, 46 S.W.3d 785, 2000 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 597 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 2001 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (Tenn. Feb. 26, 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that DNA evidence was admissible and that defendant's recourse was to challenge the evidence at trial because under the plain terms of the statute, the DNA evidence was admissible without a prior hearing on its reliability; a forensic DNA analyst testified the testing was a type of DNA testing, and she compared DNA from the Y chromosomes recovered from a swab to DNA from the Y chromosomes recovered from the specimen obtained from defendant. State v. Reed, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 22 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 16, 2020).

      <p>
       Trial court correctly denied defendant's motion seeking to prohibit the introduction of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence in an aggravated rape prosecution, since through this act the legislature has clearly mandated that DNA analysis is to be admissible in evidence without the need for expert testimony as to its reliability as long as it meets the standards set forth in the Tenn. R. Evid. State v. Harris, 866 S.W.2d 583, 1992 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 492 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method of DNA analysis is an inherently trustworthy and reliable method of identification and is admissible into evidence without antecedent expert testimony as to its trustworthiness and reliability. Parties are nevertheless allowed to offer proof that DNA analysis is not trustworthy and reliable; such a challenge, however, will go to the weight, not the admissibility, of DNA evidence. State v. Reid, — S.W.3d —, 2003 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1086 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 29, 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. LEXIS 161 (Tenn. Feb. 28, 2005), aff'd, 164 S.W.3d 286, 2005 Tenn.

       Defendant failed to make showing required for authorization of funds for him to employ deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) expert where his request for “assistance in his defense” or for “information regarding the DNA evidence the state would seek to introduce” was too general in nature and circumstances did not adequately establish “particularized necessity” for DNA expert. State v. Edwards, 868 S.W.2d 682, 1993 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 228 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court's failure to provide expert assistance to the defendant in the field of DNA analysis was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; thus, a new trial was required to ensure that the defendant was afforded due process of law.

       Trial court did not err by allowing the son of the victim and defendant to testify by closed circuit television because the trial court accredited the son's therapist's testimony that the son would “shut down” when scared or anxious and that he still exhibited fear and anxiety of defendant. The trial court also accredited the victim's testimony that the son was afraid to testify, and the trial court found that the son was traumatized and would be traumatized in a courtroom setting with defendant present, and that the emotional distress to the son would be substantial and that he would likely not be able to testify with defendant in the courtroom.

       Trial court erred in a motor vehicle accident case by excluding the accident victim's prior medical records from a medical group and a medical center because the jury was never able to see the victim's medical records from before the accident and consider the earlier diagnosis of the victim's prior injuries and whether the victim's medical condition predated the accident. The error was not harmless because the error prejudiced the judicial process and more probably than not affected the jury's verdict in the case. Goodwin v. Hanebis, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn.

       Requirements of T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t24c07s24-7-123" target="_self">24-7-123</a></cite> were satisfied, because the victim authenticated the recording of the forensic interview and was subject to cross-examination by defendant. State v. Austin, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 343 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 12, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by admitting a video recording of the victim's forensic interview where the questions were not leading and were framed in the only conceivable way to elicit whether defendant had told the victim about abusing others, the forensic interviewer's curriculum vitae showed that she was a professional who went far above the minimum requirements imposed on her, and neither the trial court nor did defense counsel had a problem understanding what the victim was saying in the video. State v. Tyler, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 322 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 29, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision to attack a witness's testimony in closing argument was a strategic decision entitled to deference and petitioner failed to establish ineffective assistance in this regard, in light of the trial court's pretrial determination that the witness had not asked leading questions in the interview and the ruling admitting the evidence. Davis v. State, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 864 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 16, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Video recording of the victim's forensic interview was properly admitted under this section because defendant stipulated the forensic interviewer met the requirements of this section, the victim testified under oath that the video was a true and correct recording of the events, and she available for cross-examination at trial, and the trial court determined that the recording possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. State v. Smith, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 370 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 11, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 608 (Tenn. Sept. 22, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual battery, the victim's forensic interview was properly admitted as the statutory requirements were met because the victim testified under oath that the video was a true and correct recording of the events, and he was subjected to cross-examination by defense counsel; the forensic interviewer testified, and the trial court determined that she met the requirements of this statute; and the trial court determined that the video recording had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. State v. Alvarado, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 548 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 27, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 677 (Tenn. Oct. 4, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual battery, even if the statements challenged by defendant were improperly admitted, any error was harmless as none of the statements in the video recording of the victim's forensic interview were so prejudicial that they more probably than not affected the jury's decision making because, although the victim talked about other behavior by defendant, such behavior did not involve children, and the victim stated that he was unsure if the allegations involving others were true; men spending time with other men had no inherent negative sexual connotation; and the other statements by the interviewer were simply statements of empathy. State v. Alvarado, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 548 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 27, 2017), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 677 (Tenn. Oct. 4, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the trial court erred by admitting the forensic interview, because the forensic interviewer held a business degree, which did not sufficiently align with the educational focus of the other listed degrees, the error was harmless because the State provided overwhelming evidence, including the victim's testimony, sufficient to support defendant's convictions. State v. Earhart, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 152 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 27, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly admitted the video of a child's forensic interview because prior to trial, it fully complied with the requirements of the statute, and the victim testified at trial and confirmed that the statements he provided in the video of the forensic interview were true. State v. Ray, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 263 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 24, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by admitting the recording of the child victim's forensic interview because the victim authenticated the recording and was subject to cross-examination by defendant, the victim testified about the recording at trial, and defendant was provided an opportunity to cross-examine her about the statements in the recording and any inconsistencies. State v. Barnett, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 333 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 3, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the victim testified she did not remember the forensic interview, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video and accrediting the victim's testimony that she recognized the interview and was telling the truth when she answered the questions on the video because the victim had reviewed the video and recognized herself in it. State v. Blackwell, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 353 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 13, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the victim testified she did not remember the forensic interview, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the video and accrediting the victim's testimony that she recognized the interview and was telling the truth when she answered the questions on the video because the victim had reviewed the video and recognized herself in it. State v. Blackwell, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 353 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 13, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the video of the forensic interview trustworthy, and it was undisputed that the forensic interviewer met the requirements of the statute; nothing on the video indicated that the victim made up her story or that she was coached, there were no alleged inconsistencies during the interview that would render it untrustworthy, and the victim gave no sign of being intimidated by her surroundings during the interview. State v. Franklin, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 377 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 28, 2019).

      <p>
       Statute provides that the forensic interviewer must not have a criminal history as determined by a criminal records background check, but this statute does not require that such records be admitted into evidence in determining the qualifications of the forensic interviewer; the witness testified that she did not have a criminal background, defendant did not contend that this testimony is false, and given her extensive history of working as a forensic interviewer, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that she was qualified under the statute. State v. Hawkins, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 42 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 20, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 427 (Tenn. June 23, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court found that the requirements of the statute had been met and allowed the admission of the forensic interview, and defendant chose not to cross-examine the witness and did not object to her qualifications as a forensic interviewer; in light of her extensive background in forensic interviewing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that she was qualified under the statute. State v. Hawkins, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 42 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 20, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 427 (Tenn. June 23, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by admitting forensic interviews of a child sexual abuse victim because the person who conducted the interviews was a qualified forensic interviewer, as the interviewer received at least forty hours of training and received at least eight hours of supervision from a qualified forensic interviewer who had also completed at least forty hours of training. State v. Johnson, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 97 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 10, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by admitting a forensic interview of the child victim, and therefore defendant was not entitled to plain error review of the issue, where the court concluded that the forensic interviewer was a “qualified forensic interviewer” for the purposes of this section, as she testified that she had completed a 40-hour forensic interview training course at the National Child Advocacy Center, shadowed a forensic interviewer during her internship, completed an advanced forensic interview training, and conducted over 2,000 forensic interviews during her six-year employment. State v. Long, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 630 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 25, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 970 (Tenn. Dec. 15, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in admitting the victim's forensic interview, as the interviewer's experience as a family advocate, forensic interviewer, and brain injury transition liaison for children qualified her. State v. Clymer, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 945 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 9, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's objection to the interviewer's qualification was waived, plus he could not establish that a clear and unequivocal rule of law was breached; the interviewer testified that she met the three-year requirement by having been employed for one year as a forensic interviewer and having worked with the center on the various social work positions for seven years, and defense counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine her regarding which of the statutory fields her work experience fell into, yet he chose not to do so. State v. Haven, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 431 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 19, 2020).

        3. Right to Confrontation.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Defendant raised no complaint about being denied the right to confront the victim, and he did not request that the victim's testimony and the video be stricken, and thus this issue was waived; in any event, there was no denial of defendant's right to confront the victim, who answered every question asked by defendant on cross-examination, and defendant had the opportunity to bring out such matters as witness bias. State v. Franklin, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 377 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 28, 2019).

       While the statute required a protective order preventing disclosure or dissemination of videos, preventing them from becoming public record, and required that they be sealed following the conclusion of the criminal proceedings, defendant's contention that the trial court failed to comply with these requirements would not entitle him to relief on his conviction, nor would it remove the videos from consideration.

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section did not confer any new jurisdiction on a court of law but only prescribed the manner of suing on lost instruments, regulating the practice thereon. Murlock v. Brown, 26 Tenn. 61, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1846).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a bank note has been cut for the purpose of transmission by mail, and one of the parts has been lost or stolen, the holder of the other part, upon satisfactory proof of the loss, may recover at law, upon the ground that the halves of a bill or note are not separately negotiable; but the court may, in its discretion, require the plaintiff to give an indemnity bond to the defendant. The court has this jurisdiction independent of the statute. Union Bank v. Warren, 36 Tenn. 167, 1856 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1856).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court of law has jurisdiction as against the indorser upon the lost indorsement. Hughes v. Herrin, 6 Tenn. App. 604, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 154 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).

      <p>
       The remedy at law, under the statute, does not supersede the former remedy in equity. That remains as it was before. Carter v. Vaulx, 32 Tenn. 639, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1853).

      <p>
       The affidavit of the loss of an apprentice bond and of its contents, made by the apprentice upon belief, and signed by his mark, suggesting that he could not have read the instrument, the bond being executed when he was under eight years of age, and not stating that he had ever seen it or read it, is insufficient. Cheek v. James, 49 Tenn. 170, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       The affidavit is defective if it omits statement that the instrument is still the property of the claimant, and unintentionally lost. It must be made in the court in which the suit is brought. Buckner v. Geodeker, 45 S.W. 448, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 1, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 105 (1897).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The affidavit of the lost of the instrument, appended to the declaration, is made a part of the record, and is to be taken as a substitute for profert of the instrument, and the sufficiency and validity of the declaration, including the affidavit, may be tested by demurrer. Carter v. Vaulx, 32 Tenn. 639, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1853).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where affidavit is rejected as defective, and no application to amend and no further proof offered, a decree for defendant is properly rendered. Buckner v. Geodeker, 45 S.W. 448, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 1, 1897 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 105 (1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action on lost note want of profert or want of affidavit in lieu thereof can be taken advantage of only by demurrer, and a verdict cures the defect. Hughes v. Herrin, 6 Tenn. App. 604, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 154 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).

      <p>
       The affidavit of loss must be made by a person acquainted with the facts; and it may be made by an agent or attorney of the owner, if he knows the facts. Carter v. Vaulx, 32 Tenn. 639, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1853); Halliburton v. Jackson, 79 Tenn. 471, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1883).

       Where suit is brought upon a lost instrument, the affidavit of its loss must be made in the court before the court or the clerk thereof, in which the suit was instituted, or was commenced or is pending. Carter v. Vaulx, 32 Tenn. 639, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1853); Tyree v. Magness, 33 Tenn. 276, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1853); Baker v. Grigsby, 54 Tenn. 627, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 97 (1872); Jones v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The want of an affidavit of the loss of the instrument sued on, accompanying the declaration in lieu of making profert, is waived by a plea to the merits, without insisting upon the omission, and is cured by the verdict, and the judgment will not be arrested for such defect. Lowry v. Medlin, 25 Tenn. 450, 1846 Tenn. LEXIS 20 (1846); McMillan Marble Co. v. Black, 89 Tenn. 118, 14 S.W. 479, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1890).

      <p>
       Secondary evidence as to the contents of a lost instrument cannot be heard until its nonproduction is accounted for by the person last having the legal custody thereof. It is the province of the judge, and not the jury, to determine from the proof whether there is a reasonable presumption that the paper has been lost. Pharis v. Lambert, 33 Tenn. 228, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1853); Tyree v. Magness, 33 Tenn. 276, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1853); Vaulx v. Merriwether, 34 Tenn. 683, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1855); Anderson v. Maberry, 49 Tenn. 653, 1871 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Oral proof as to the contents of a lost deed or other paper relied on as evidence cannot be heard until ground has been laid by proof that all the proper sources for the recovery of the original have been searched in vain. Vaulx v. Merriwether, 34 Tenn. 683, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1855); King v. Cox, 126 Tenn. 553, 151 S.W. 58, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       The loss of a bond is not sufficiently established by the testimony of the clerk of the county court (now county clerk), who came into the office 16 or 17 years after its execution, that, since the case was called for trial, he had examined the papers in his office labeled “1851” (the year the bond was given), and did not find the bond, so as to authorize secondary evidence of the contents of the bond. Cheek v. James, 49 Tenn. 170, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       The contents of a lost bond are not established by the testimony of the chairman of the county court, who states that he does not recollect much about the circumstances, and conjectures the contents from the usual form in such cases. Cheek v. James, 49 Tenn. 170, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 209 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit upon a constable's bond against the sureties, a copy of the bond, certified by the clerk of the county court (now county clerk) to be a true and correct copy, as it appears of record and on file in his office, and produced by the clerk of the circuit court from a file of papers in his office, in a suit against the same sureties, in which a final judgment had been pronounced, is prima facie evidence of the bond, and that it was duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded by the county court, it having been first shown that the records and papers of that court, for the year in which the bond was given, and for several years immediately preceding and following, were lost or destroyed, and the defendants admitting by their pleadings that they did sign the bond. Amis v. Marks, 71 Tenn. 568, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a suit to recover penalty on title bond is founded on a copy, the original claimed to have been lost, and suit brought ten years after its claimed execution, its execution and acknowledgment must be established by clear and cogent testimony. Johnson v. McKamey, 53 S.W. 221, 1899 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 65 (1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence stated was sufficient to prove execution of lost retention of title note. Brasfield Hardware Co. v. Harris, 5 Tenn. App. 652, — S.W. —, 1927 Tenn. App. LEXIS 104 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927).

       Copies of lost instruments are admissible in evidence if it was shown by the testimony of a justice of the peace, before whom the suit was brought on the note, that the original warrant, the note, and the notice had been lost; that careful search had been made and they could not be found; that he was acquainted with the facts of the case; and that the copies filed by him he believed to be true and perfect copies. This was sufficient to supply the lost instruments. McDonald v. Baldwin, 24 Tenn. App. 670, 148 S.W.2d 385, 1940 Tenn. App. LEXIS 79 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1940).

       The lost record or other paper cannot be supplied in a court of law, except that in which the cause is pending, and to which the paper belonged, or of which the record is a part.

       A note lost after suit had been brought upon it before a justice of the peace may be supplied on transfer to the circuit court, by copies, like any other lost papers in the cause. Travis v. Laurace, 2 Shan. 109 (1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a cause had been transferred from a justice to the circuit court, after the levy of an execution on land, for the purpose of obtaining an order of condemnation, the circuit court could make an order supplying the original summons, though it had never been on file in that court, it having been lost before the transfer of the cause, because the power vested in courts by this section is not limited to papers filed in the court which makes the order, but applies to any paper “filed in an action.” Baker Watkins Supply Co. v.

      <p>
       The provisions of this section were intended only to enable a party, during the pendency of the suit, to supply any record, proceeding, or paper which had been filed in the action, and had been lost or destroyed, or fraudulently made away with, and which he might conceive to be necessary to a correct adjudication of his rights in such action, and not for the supplying of a final judgment which had been destroyed. The proper practice, where the record of a judgment has been lost, and the plaintiff desires an execution thereon, is to apply to the court where the judgment was rendered for an execution, and, upon satisfactory proof of the rendition of the judgment and the loss of the record thereof, execution may be awarded. Faust v. Echols, 44 Tenn. 397, 1867 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (1867); Childress v. Marks, 61 Tenn. 12, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 334 (1872); Randall v. Payne, 1 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 137 (1873); Whitworth v.

      <p>
       It is suggested that the spirit of the provision of this section, and perhaps the common law, would authorize the court, in its discretion, to order new pleadings to be prepared, if the parties are alive; but this would not be allowable where the loss was occasioned with that end in view, nor where a copy of the lost pleadings may be had, nor where the new pleadings are in conflict with the old, as shown by the evidence.

      <p>
       The question whether there has been a loss is a preliminary one, and the judge must determine from the proof whether there has been such loss, before secondary evidence as to the contents thereof is admissible; and when the loss has been adjudged, the court must then order the lost paper or record to be supplied by secondary evidence; and the court adjudges as to the sufficiency of such evidence. If it is adjudged sufficient, the court orders the supplied paper or record to be substituted for the original. State v. Harrison, 18 Tenn. 542, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1837); Tyree v. Magness, 33 Tenn. 276, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1853); Lane v. Jones, 42 Tenn. 318, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1865); Galbraith v. McFarland, 43 Tenn. 267, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1866); Anderson v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that the best evidence within the power of the party shall be produced admits of no evasion. So, where a peace warrant, the foundation of an action for malicious prosecution, was lost in the hands of plaintiff's counsel, his evidence, if he be in reach of process, is indispensably necessary to account for the nonproduction of the original warrant, before proof can be heard of its contents. Pharis v. Lambert, 33 Tenn. 228, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1853); Vaulx v. Merriwether, 34 Tenn. 683, 1855 Tenn. LEXIS 119 (1855); Cornelius v. City Bank, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 5 (1875); Southern R. Co. v. Seymour, 113 Tenn. 523, 83 S.W. 674, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unintentional loss must be shown before order to supply is made, and the order to supply must then be made. Lane v. Jones, 42 Tenn. 318, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1865); Galbraith v. McFarland, 43 Tenn. 267, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1866); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Ordway, Gordon & McGuire, 76 Tenn. 558, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application for supplying a lost record, or paper, or proceeding must be supported by satisfactory evidence that the same has been lost or made way with as provided in the statute; then the same may be supplied, under the order of the court, but not otherwise. Graves v. Keaton, 43 Tenn. 8, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1866); Galbraith v. McFarland, 43 Tenn. 267, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1866); Cornelius v. City Bank, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 5 (1875).

      <p>
       The proof of the loss of a paper or record by the legal custodian dispenses with the necessity of an affidavit of loss by the party offering to prove its contents. Hale v. Darter, 29 Tenn. 92, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1849).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the loss of the paper or record should appear from the affidavit of the clerk of the court, as the keeper of the records. Peirce & Pittman v. Bank of Tennessee, 31 Tenn. 265, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1851); Lane v. Jones, 42 Tenn. 318, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1865); Rhea v. McCorkle, 58 Tenn. 415, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       The unintentional loss or destruction of the record may ordinarily be established by the evidence of the clerk or other officer entrusted by law with the care and custody of the same, instead of the attorney in the case. Lane v. Jones, 42 Tenn. 318, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1865).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a party to a suit, instead of the clerk, made the affidavit of loss, is not reversible error. Johnson v. Hall, 68 Tenn. 351, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant is entitled to have lost search warrant and affidavit upon which it issued supplied upon trial; but, in absence of testimony from clerk of court that such papers in his custody are lost, testimony of others as to loss is insufficient for admission of secondary evidence. Strunk v. State, 154 Tenn. 56, 289 S.W. 532, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1926).

       No paper can be supplied, unless it has been “filed in an action” and has thus become a record. Baker v. McMinnville, 49 Tenn. 117, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 200 (1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       Papers which have not been filed in an action and have not thus become a record cannot be supplied after the cause has been determined, by proof that they were read at the hearing. The chancery court has no power thus to manufacture records from the uncertain memory of witnesses after a cause has been determined. Mullins v. Aiken, 49 Tenn. 535, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1871); Hearst v. Proffit, 115 Tenn. 560, 91 S.W. 207, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1905).

       Where the warrant and note were lost before the justice, they cannot be established and supplied upon the justice's mere certificate of their loss and his certificate of copies thereof. The facts stated should be under oath. Halliburton v. Jackson, 79 Tenn. 471, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1883); Baker Watkins Supply Co. v. Fowlkes, 129 Tenn. 663, 168 S.W. 153, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1914).

       When the record books are burned, mutilated or lost, the clerk's docket and the notes of the presiding judge are the next best evidence of the contents of the record, and must be produced, in preference to the parol evidence of witnesses, for the law is justly jealous of the memory of witnesses, when they come to speak of the contents of a written instrument. Lane v. Jones, 42 Tenn. 318, 1865 Tenn. LEXIS 67 (1865).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under an order to supply lost papers, the evidence of the clerk of the court, or of the solicitor in the cause, to the fact that the copies presented to the court are true copies of the lost papers, is sufficient. Terry v. Wood, 66 Tenn. 292, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 127 (1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lost indictment or presentment may be supplied upon satisfactory affidavits of the district attorney, the grand jury officer, and the entries on the grand jury book, independent of the recollection of the presiding judge.

       Where appeal bond was lost in lower court after filing, clerk's certificate as to the filing and loss will not be accepted in lieu of the bond.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where judicial review of an administrative judge's decision is sought, missing evidence is ordinarily supplied by affidavit from the clerk and master, the attorneys, or any other person who is best acquainted with the facts or nature of the missing record. Goins v. University of Tennessee Memorial Research Center & Hosp., 821 S.W.2d 942, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 510 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991).
      </p>

       The proper procedure for supplying the lost portions of the record would have been to offer summaries of the video tape, photographs and other exhibits by sworn affidavit not by making a motion for summary judgment or remand of the case for a new administrative hearing.

       The appellate court will not supply a record lost or destroyed in the court below, and where the record was not properly supplied below, so that there is nothing before the appellate court that will enable it to take jurisdiction of the cause, so as to review the judgment of the court below, the cause will be struck from the docket, with leave to proceed in the proper mode to establish the loss of the record.

       Decree could not be sustained in favor of defendant on basis of affidavit by defendant as to what was contained in papers lost since no substantial copy of the proceedings was presented for court's approval and in no event should a decree be based on mere affidavits by a party to the proceedings.

       If, from the nature of the case itself, it is manifest that a more satisfactory kind of secondary evidence exists, the party will be required to produce it; but when the nature of the case does not, of itself, disclose the existence of such better evidence, the objector must not only prove its existence, but also must prove that it was known to the other party, in season to have been produced at the trial.

       “(a)  The witness, if he is a practicing physician, shall be exempt from appearance in court to testify, provided he clearly states his profession in his deposition. No subpoena need be served on such a witness in order for such exemption to be valid.

      <p>
       “(b)  If the witness fails to claim exemption at the time mentioned, he may be allowed the benefit of it, by application to the court.

      <p>
       “(c)  A false claim set up by the witness shall in no way affect the right of the party summoning the witness under the provisions of this Code, and the burden of proof is on the witness, upon scire facias, to show the fact entitling him to exemption.”

        postconviction court erred by failing to grant petitioner's physician's motion to quash a judicial subpoena compelling him to testify at a hearing on behalf of petitioner because he was statutorily exempt from subpoena to the hearing but was subject to subpoena to a deposition. The court further held that it saw no reason why petitioner could not participate in the physician's deposition via telephone, video, or some other media, and therefore petitioner's inability to leave prison to attend a deposition was not sufficient justification for denying the physician's motion to quash.
