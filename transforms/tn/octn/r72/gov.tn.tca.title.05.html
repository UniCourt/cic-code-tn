        A county is defined to be “a government within a government,” and cannot be dissolved or destroyed by direct legislative enactment. Ferguson v. Tyler, 134 Tenn. 25, 183 S.W. 162, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county, which existed as a unit of government when the state was organized under the Constitution of 1796, is an integral part or arm of the state; and no distinct line of demarcation can be drawn between county and state officers, with official duty as the only test, or between county purposes and state purposes, with objective as the only test. Davidson County v. Kirkpatrick, 150 Tenn. 546, 266 S.W. 107, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counties are created by statute and the statutes prescribe their powers, duties and liabilities. Armitage v. Holt, 21 Tenn. App. 273, 109 S.W.2d 411, 1937 Tenn. App. LEXIS 31 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute does not mean that no other body can act in certain capacities for the county. State ex rel. Bobo v. Moore, 207 Tenn. 622, 341 S.W.2d 746, 1960 Tenn. LEXIS 502 (1960).

       </p>
       <p>
        A county is a public corporation, created by the government for political purposes, and invested with subordinate legislative powers, to be exercised for local purposes connected with the public good, and such powers are, in general, subject to the control of the general assembly of the state. Maury County v. Lewis County, 31 Tenn. 236, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1851); Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904); Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        For some purposes, counties are merely civil divisions, but for other purposes, they are certainly corporations. They are, therefore, sometimes called quasi-corporations. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. County Court of Davidson, 33 Tenn. 637, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1854); Winston v. Tennessee & P.R.R., 60 Tenn. 60, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 415 (1873); Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counties in this state are clothed with the powers and attributes of corporations to a sufficient extent to be able to act and contract, and whether this be by the action of the county legislative body, or a vote of the people, or any other agency, can make no difference. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. County Court of Davidson, 33 Tenn. 637, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 81 (1854); Beck v. Puckett, 2 Shan. 490 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        In Tennessee, counties are considered public municipal corporations with limited powers, and liable as such. White's Creek Turnpike Co. v. Davidson County, 82 Tenn. 73, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 107 (1884), superseded by statute as stated in, Jenkins v. Loudon County, 736 S.W.2d 603, 1987 Tenn. LEXIS 1084 (Tenn. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Considered with respect to their powers, duties and liabilities, counties stand low down in the scale of corporate existence. They are ranked as quasi-corporations to distinguish them from private corporations and from municipal corporations proper. Burnett v. Maloney, 97 Tenn. 697, 37 S.W. 689, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 197, <cite class="lra">34 L.R.A. 541</cite> (1896); Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).

         3. Counties and Municipal Corporations Distinguished.
        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Counties do not hold and operate under charters, as do municipal corporations, they have no franchises, they can make no bylaws, they have the same powers and duties throughout the state, and other distinctions are stated. Burnett v. Maloney, 97 Tenn. 697, 37 S.W. 689, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 197, <cite class="lra">34 L.R.A. 541</cite> (1896); Southern R. Co. v. Hamblen County, 115 Tenn. 526, 92 S.W. 238, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1906); Edmonson v. Walker, 137 Tenn. 569, 195 S.W. 168, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 169 (1917), overruled, State ex. rel. Williamson County v. A&amp;F Constr., — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 275 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a municipal body, a county is an arm or instrument of the state to carry out the purposes of government, but it is not so highly organized as the municipal corporation proper (town or city). Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904).
       </p>

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        The county legislative body represents the county in its civil and political powers, its rights and obligations, and it is through the county legislative body that the county may act or be acted upon. Maury County v. Lewis County, 31 Tenn. 236, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1851); Dulaney v. Dunlap, 43 Tenn. 306, 1866 Tenn. LEXIS 56 (1866); Hunter v. Justices of Campbell County, 47 Tenn. 49, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1869); Grant v. Lindsay, 58 Tenn. 651, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 315 (1872); Beck v. Puckett, 2 Shan. 490 (1877); Davidson County v. Olwill, 72 Tenn. 28, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1879); Lauderdale County v. Fargason, 75 Tenn. 153, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 91 (1881); Nashville & K. R. Co. v. Wilson County, 89 Tenn. 597, 15 S.W. 446, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1891); Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904); Wright v. Cunningham, 115 Tenn. 445, 91 S.W. 293, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 79 (1905); Southern R. Co. v. Hamblen County, 115 Tenn. 526, 92 S.W. 238, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1906); State v. True, 116 Tenn. 294, 95 S.W. 1028, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counties may act as other corporations by their representatives, the county legislative body, or by their agents and committees. Beck v. Puckett, 2 Shan. 490 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        The political, municipal, police and legislative powers of the county are to be exercised by and through the county legislative body, as empowered and controlled by the general assembly. Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general assembly has the power to strip county legislative body of its nonconstitutional powers and may transfer those powers to a board of commissioners or other agency. Shelby County Board of Comm'rs v. Shelby County Quarterly Court, 216 Tenn. 470, 392 S.W.2d 935, 1965 Tenn. LEXIS 592 (1965).

        The county's field of action is local and limited to the confines of the county. The rights, duties, obligations, privileges and offices are exercisable in the county by the body politic composing the county, exclusive of the agency of the officers of any and every other like county. Stewart v. Roberts, 9 Tenn. 386, 9 Tenn. 387, 1830 Tenn. LEXIS 28 (1830); Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904); Southern R. Co. v. Hamblen County, 115 Tenn. 526, 92 S.W. 238, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1906); Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county's function in regard to its public institutions is legislative. McAndrews v. Hamilton County, 105 Tenn. 399, 58 S.W. 483, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1900); State ex rel. Citizens v. Justices of Wayne County, 108 Tenn. 259, 67 S.W. 72, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1901). See also, as to legislative powers, Maury County v. Lewis County, 31 Tenn. 236, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 52 (1851); Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904); Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        The powers of counties, except those necessarily implied, must be found within statutory provisions made by the general assembly. One dealing with a county is bound at one's peril to take notice of the limitations of its authority. State ex rel. Wilson County v. Lebanon & Nashville Turnpike Co., 151 Tenn. 150, 268 S.W. 627, 1924 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority of the governing body of a county to exercise corporate powers cannot be delegated, only ministerial acts carrying out the details of such matters may be delegated. Rutherford County v. Murfreesboro, 43 Tenn. App. 489, 309 S.W.2d 778, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 132 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

        The county legislative body cannot delegate its authority in such matters as the appropriation of money, the disposition of property and the like. Rutherford County v. Murfreesboro, 43 Tenn. App. 489, 309 S.W.2d 778, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 132 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

        County legislative body that acted in good faith was authorized to employ counsel in case involving constitutionality of an act although county was not named as a party to the proceeding. Reece v. Polk County, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 354 (1912); Crewse v. Beeler, 186 Tenn. 475, 212 S.W.2d 39, 1948 Tenn. LEXIS 568 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county legislative body has only such power and jurisdiction as vested by law and cannot bind the county for any purpose until the record, which is the sole evidence thereof, has been made; thus an attorney cannot recover for services rendered under parol contract with the court in adjusting county's claim under the Highway Reimbursement Act. Epps v. Washington County, 173 Tenn. 373, 117 S.W.2d 749, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The records of the county legislative body are the sole witness of proceedings of such court to employ counsel and authorize a charge against the county to pay counsel's compensation. Epps v. Washington County, 173 Tenn. 373, 117 S.W.2d 749, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of the county legislative body in electing a county attorney and fixing such attorney's salary or retainer may be construed as being the employment of such attorney to represent the county in litigated cases against it with compensation to be fixed as provided by statute or by subsequent appropriation, but cannot be construed as having authorized such attorney to adjust the claims of the county with the state in reference to highway construction and to entitle such attorney to compensation for such services. Epps v. Washington County, 173 Tenn. 373, 117 S.W.2d 749, 1937 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1938).

        A county is no more liable to be sued for the neglect of duty by its officers than is the state for similar neglect. The common law gives no such action, and it is therefore not sustainable at all, unless given by statute. Wood v. Tipton County, 66 Tenn. 112, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 88, 32 Am. Rep. 561 (1874).

        The county is declared to be a corporation to facilitate the execution of the powers delegated to it, and to enable it to make binding contracts, and to be liable to suit for just claims arising under such contracts, but this is the extent to which, as corporations, counties can be sued.

        This section does not enlarge the liability of counties, nor create any new liability against them, and does not authorize suit for neglect of the officers of the county.

        Where county hired contractor to construct a school and the contractor hired a subcontractor to dig the sewers, the negligence of the subcontractor was the sole proximate cause of the death of its employee, plaintiff's intestate, and plaintiff's theory that defendant was liable because it had a nondelegable duty to protect plaintiff's intestate from injury due to hazards created by unlawful work and work that is necessarily dangerous is without merit, since ditchdigging is not an activity considered to be inherently dangerous and, even if it were, defendant would not be considered a “supplier” of ditchdigging and hence would not be vicariously liable.

        These districts are considered a very important feature in our system and policy. They constitute small communities better enabling the people to carry out self-government, as regards their smallest and greatest interests, and the system is of special value in the exercise of the elective franchise.

        It will be presumed that each county is laid off into “districts of convenient size,” in which places are designated for holding popular elections. Marshall v. Kerns, 32 Tenn. 68, 1852 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1852).

        Civil districts of counties are not, in the sense of the constitution, incorporated towns having taxing powers, and fact that they are vested with some of the capacities of corporate bodies does not make them incorporated towns. Keesee v. Civil Dist. Board of Education, 46 Tenn. 127, 1868 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1868).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil districts cannot be endowed with corporate life and power of taxation cannot be delegated to them. Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904); Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).

       <p>
        The fact that the constitution provides that counties shall be laid off, as the general assembly may direct, into districts does not necessarily imply that the general assembly itself shall not do the work. A statute redistricting a county, and providing that the civil districts thereby established shall not be increased or diminished in number in the future, except by acts of the general assembly, is not for that reason unconstitutional. Grainger County v. State, 111 Tenn. 234, 80 S.W. 750, 1903 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute, abolishing certain districts and redistricting the county, is constitutional, though the districts as laid off in the statute are disproportionate in area, wealth and population, and of shape inconvenient to their inhabitants. The power to create the districts is a political power vested in the legislative department to be exercised in its discretion, not subject to review by the courts. Maxey v. Powers, 117 Tenn. 381, 101 S.W. 181, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1907).

        The statutes reducing the number and thereby abolishing some of the districts, operate as an inevitable legal consequence to destroy all offices that are dependent upon the district for their existence.

       Based on the applicable definitions of “agriculture” and “agricultural,” concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) clearly involve “agricultural” activities and the “agricultural” use of land and structures. Thus, a county is not authorized to regulate CAFOs under its zoning powers or its general powers.

        Once elected, members of a charter commission have a duty to prepare and file a charter for consideration by the people. The applicable statutes place no limits on a county legislative body’s authority to extend the time a charter commission has to prepare and file its proposed charter.  State law does not provide any other specific remedies for a charter commission’s failure to fulfill its duty, but a county legislative body has some implied authority over the continued existence of the commission.

        Once elected, members of a charter commission have a duty to prepare and file a charter for consideration by the people. The applicable statutes place no limits on a county legislative body’s authority to extend the time a charter commission has to prepare and file its proposed charter.  State law does not provide any other specific remedies for a charter commission’s failure to fulfill its duty, but a county legislative body has some implied authority over the continued existence of the commission.

      <p>
       The territory of a county of which it is unconstitutionally deprived will be restored to it, and it will not be estopped by mere lapse of time, in ignorance of the fact of the encroachment; but, until the filing of the bill, the revenue collected from the territory by the county to which it was thus unconstitutionally attached will not be refunded to the county from which it was so detached.

       Under Tenn. Const., art. X, § 4, it is required that two-thirds of all the qualified voters of the county must affirmatively express their concurrence in the removal of the county seat and legislation specifying other basis is unconstitutional to that extent. Bouldin v. Lockhart, 62 Tenn. 262, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 187 (1873); Combs v. Stumple, 79 Tenn. 26, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1883); Lindsay v. Allen, 112 Tenn. 637, 82 S.W. 171, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       An act that provides that if it is ascertained that the people desire the removal by a concurrence of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the county, then that an election be held to ascertain the location for the county seat and that the place receiving the majority vote shall be the location, is unconstitutional. The removal and location must concur in one election, and the chancery court, at the instance of citizens and taxpayers of the county, will enjoin the holding of a popular election to ascertain the location, and further proceedings, after the election has been held and so carried. Combs v. Stumple, 79 Tenn. 26, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1883).

      </h4>
      <p>
       When the general assembly attempts to permit removal without the required vote, citizens and taxpayers of the county may restrain the removal. Stuart v. Bair, 67 Tenn. 141, 1874 Tenn. LEXIS 340 (1874); Lindsay v. Allen, 112 Tenn. 637, 82 S.W. 171, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 61 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an actual removal of the county seat has been unconstitutionally effected, it cannot be ordered returned, but, at the instance of citizens and taxpayers of the county, the chancery court will declare the order of removal void, and enjoin the commissioners from further proceedings to erect the new county seat, and the county legislative body from levying taxes or incurring further expense for this purpose. Bouldin v. Lockhart, 69 Tenn. 195, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1878); Braden v. Stumph, 84 Tenn. 581, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 146 (1886).

       Removal applies to a transfer of the seat of county government from the established county seat town to some other city or town in the county and not a change of the site of the courthouse from one part of the county seat town to another part of the same town.

       Amendments. The 2016 amendment deleted former (c)(3) which read: “(3)(A) Any member of a local governing body of a county or a municipality who is also an employee of such county or municipality may vote on matters in which such member has a conflict of interest if the member informs the governing body immediately prior to the vote as follows:“Because I am an employee of (name of governmental unit), I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted. However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation to my constituents and the citizens this body represents.“(B) In the event a member of a local governing body of a county or a municipality has a conflict of interest in a matter to be voted upon by the body, such member may abstain for cause by announcing such to the presiding officer. Any member of a local governing body of a county or municipality who abstains from voting for cause on any issue coming to a vote before the body shall not be counted for the purpose of determining a majority vote.“(C) The vote of any person having a conflict of interest who does not inform the governing body of such conflict as provided in subdivision (c)(3)(A) shall be void if challenged in a timely manner. As used in this section, “timely manner” means during the same meeting at which the vote was cast and prior to the transaction of any further business by the body.“(D) Nothing in this subdivision (c)(3) shall be construed as altering, amending or otherwise affecting § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.12.html#t12c04s12-4-101ol1a" target="_blank">12-4-101(a)</a></cite>.

       </h4>
       <p>
        Where the general assembly has made a permanent, general provision, applicable in nearly 90 of the counties, giving the local legislative bodies discretion as to the method of election of their members, it could not properly make different provisions for two of the counties, by population bracket; such legislation is not authorized by either Tenn. Const., art. VII or art. XI, § 9. Leech v. Wayne County, 588 S.W.2d 270, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 516 (Tenn. 1979) (declaring unconstitutional former portions of this section).
       </p>
       <p>
        When properly construed there is no conflict between this statute's provisions for filling vacancies and Tenn. Const., art. VII, § 1. Both the constitutional provision and the statute provide for the vacancy to be filled by the legislative body. Marion County Bd. of Comm'rs v. Marion County Election Com., 594 S.W.2d 681, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 407 (Tenn. 1980).

        The overriding legislative purpose was to provide a mechanism for the selection of successor county commissioners designed, on the one hand, to ensure that the people had continuing representation, and on the other, to give maximum opportunity for the public to exercise its choice. Hence, the remaining members of the legislative body name a temporary successor and the people fill the vacancy on the date of a primary or the date of a referendum election.

        The county executive (now county mayor) has no power to make appropriations of county moneys; this power belongs to the county legislative body, therefore a proceeding to compel an appropriation of money out of the county treasury should be against the members of the county legislative body and not against the county executive (now county mayor).

        The “county warrant” is a mode of reaching money in the county treasury, and is a voucher to the disbursing officer. Camp v. Knox County, 71 Tenn. 199, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1879); Davidson County v. Olwill, 72 Tenn. 28, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1879); Bank of Gallatin v. Baber, 74 Tenn. 273, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 247 (1880).

       <p>
        The county executive (now county mayor) has no power to draw a warrant upon the treasury of the county for any funds in the hands of the county trustee, in the absence of express statutory authority, without an appropriation having first been made for that purpose by the county legislative body, who alone are authorized to act for the county in such matters. State v. True, 116 Tenn. 294, 95 S.W. 1028, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrants may be issued although there is no money in the treasury to pay them, but they cannot be paid unless an appropriation has been made. Macon County v. Dixon, 20 Tenn. App. 425, 100 S.W.2d 5, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 34 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

        </span>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Mandamus will not lie to compel the county executive (now county mayor) to issue a county warrant, where he disputes the correctness or justness of an unadjudicated claim. Connell v. County Judge of Davidson, 39 Tenn. 189, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 276 (1858); Whitesides v. Stewart, 91 Tenn. 710, 20 S.W. 245, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus was ordered against county executive (now county mayor) where there was no right of setoff as claimed. Robison v. Hawkins, 80 Tenn. 450, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 194 (1883).

        County warrants are not negotiable and do not bear interest as a matter of law, even after demand of payment. Camp v. Knox County, 71 Tenn. 199, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1879); Gibson County v. Rains, 79 Tenn. 20, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        While county legislative body cannot by general order make all county warrants bear interest indefinitely, it could contract to pay interest on the county's warrants for forbearance to sue until sufficient money was in the treasury for payment. Davidson County v. Olwill, 72 Tenn. 28, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1879).

       <p>
        Where a county trustee paid a warrant by check but turned same over to a bank for money with which to pay the warrant, the same was extinguished and could not be revived as an obligation by such delivery to the bank. Bank of Erin v. Houston County, 6 Tenn. App. 638, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 194 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       <p>
        Warrants are assignable, and may be sued upon in name of payee for use. A written assignment by payee vests legal title in assignee and parol assignment vests equitable title, enforceable in equity. Bradley County v. Surgoine & Tibbs, 65 Tenn. 108, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 315 (1873); Bank of Erin v. Houston County, 6 Tenn. App. 638, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 194 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purchaser or bearer of a county warrant, without the written endorsement or assignment of the payee, cannot maintain a suit on it in his own name against the county. Bradley County v. Surgoine & Tibbs, 65 Tenn. 108, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 315 (1873); Bradley County v. Surgoine & Tibbs, 68 Tenn. 407, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrant regular on its face establishes prima facie the validity of the claim, but assignee takes subject to risk of invalidity since a warrant is not a negotiable instrument. Bank of Erin v. Houston County, 6 Tenn. App. 638, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 194 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       <p>
        Where county warrants are regular on their face the burden is on the county to prove their invalidity. Macon County v. Dixon, 20 Tenn. App. 425, 100 S.W.2d 5, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 34 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to determine the validity of county warrants, it was wrong to exclude testimony relating to the preparation and submission of claims on the ground that the county records were the best evidence when the county held the records and refused to produce them. Macon County v. Dixon, 20 Tenn. App. 425, 100 S.W.2d 5, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 34 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

        Interest, by way of damages, may be allowed on county warrants by the jury or the court trying the case, without the intervention of a jury, if equity and justice demands it. Gibson County v. Rains, 79 Tenn. 20, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 7 (1883).

          The duties of the county mayor in regard to any petition filed pursuant to title 7, chapter 82, are transferred to the water and wastewater treatment authority board under title 68, chapter 221, part 6 in any county that has created such authority. The preceding sentence does not apply to any petition by any governmental entity or state instrumentality that does not purport to adjust or otherwise modify any territory included in the service area of a water and wastewater treatment authority. Such petitions may be granted if the board determines in its sole discretion that the public convenience and necessity require the same. The general assembly enacts this section as a statement of its intent that this section is a clarification of title 68, chapter 221, part 6. From and after the creation of a water and wastewater treatment authority and the establishment of its service area, the authority shall be the sole and exclusive provider of its authorized services in its service area. The designated service area for any particular function or service shall not include any area located within the boundaries of another governmental entity providing the same function or service on the date the service area is established. Different service areas may be established for different functions or services. The authority may cede all or any portion of its functions or service area to another governmental entity upon the board determining in its sole discretion that the public convenience and necessity require the same.

         Each county trustee may adopt a checking system for the disbursing of county funds by the county trustee as prescribed by this section by giving at least thirty (30) days notice to each official authorized to sign checks. Once adopted, any trustee may, with the approval of the county finance committee created pursuant to § 5-8-201, or with the approval of the county legislative body, discontinue the application of this section.
        </li>

         For purposes of this section, the “county master account” means all accounts maintained by the county trustee for the purpose of handling banking transactions of the various county funds required by law to be managed by the county trustee, except for any check clearing account as defined in subsection (c). The county trustee shall reconcile all county master accounts and shall maintain all records as required by law relating to such accounts, including maintaining paid checks.
        </li>

         For purposes of this section, “check clearing account” includes any account created for combined offices and departments or created for separate offices or departments, or both, that the county trustee establishes as a separate checking account for county payrolls or as a method of certifying checks. If any check clearing account is established, such account shall be reconciled by the county trustee, except that a separate clearing account established for a single office or department shall be reconciled by that office or department; provided, that if the county trustee deems it necessary or advisable, the county trustee may reconcile any check clearing account established for a single office or department, which shall include maintaining the paid checks.
        </li>
        <li id="t05c08s5-8-210ol1d">
         Any financial institution charges incurred by a county for a county master account or for a check clearing account shall be an allowable office expense for the county trustee; provided, that any financial institution charges incurred for a check clearing account established for a single office or department shall be a charge against the funds of the office or department.
        </li>
        <li id="t05c08s5-8-210ol1e">
         In any county coming under this section, a county master account and a check clearing account shall be established by the county trustee at a financial institution selected by the county finance committee created pursuant to § 5-8-201 or, if the county legislative body has not created a county finance committee or the county finance committee fails to specify one (1) or more financial institutions, then the county trustee may select a financial institution authorized to handle such account. Any financial institution shall be selected based on the institution offering the highest and best bid or bids to pay interest on daily balances of the county's funds, considering the lowest service charges, and considering other factors affecting safety and liquidity of county moneys.
        </li>
        <li id="t05c08s5-8-210ol1f">
         When the financial institution has been selected, the county trustee shall establish one (1) or more county master bank accounts or one (1) or more check clearing accounts, or both, and have each official authorized by law to sign checks drawn on each account to complete forms as required by the financial institution. The forms shall be completed and returned to the financial institution prior to any checks being issued on the account. Persons who have the authority to sign checks drawn on the account shall promptly complete these forms and return them to the county trustee. The county trustee shall maintain a copy of these forms and shall provide a copy of each completed form to the county mayor and to each person who is authorized to sign checks drawn on the account.

         The county trustee, in conjunction with the financial institution, may designate specifications for checks used to make withdrawals on any account established pursuant to this section. In the event of a written objection to the specifications by the county mayor, a department head, the director of accounts and budgets, or the director of finance is filed with the trustee, the county trustee's specifications for checks shall be approved by the finance committee created pursuant to § 5-8-201, or by the county legislative body.

           List Certification Method.  This method requires each department, including the county mayor, a department head, director of accounts and budgets, and a director of finance, to submit a list by fund to the county trustee of the checks being issued showing the date of the check, check number, payee and amount. The county trustee verifies the department's fund balance and certifies that funds are available or will be available in the “check clearing account” for payment of those checks. The county trustee then transfers funds from the “county master account” to the “check clearing account.” The county trustee may develop a procedure for emergency certification by the county trustee in circumstances where such would be reasonable, in which event the county trustee must be provided with a written document for certification by the end of the next business day;

The county trustee verifies the department's fund balance. The county trustee signs or validates each check if sufficient funds are or will be available and makes any necessary transfer of funds from the master account to the check clearing account;

        The county has power to appropriate money for the support of the poor of the county, and is the exclusive judge as to whether the persons provided for are “poor persons,” in the sense of the law; and if the order appropriating the money recites that they are poor persons, or the equivalent, it is conclusive on this point, and a valid appropriation.

       “That it is hereby determined and declared that the purpose of this act is to do that which the state welfare demands, and the state public policy requires:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a)  That the migration and loss of the people of Tennessee, who are compelled to leave the territorial limits of the state, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly to obtain employment and earn a livelihood be retarded and reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  That the conditions of unemployment existing statewide in Tennessee be relieved thereby reducing the evils attendant thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  That the average family income in Tennessee be raised and increased as much as possible, but to an amount at least the average over the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  That a means be provided for the citizens of communities to promote and develop industry in their areas, when it is possible for them to do so in their separate and individual capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  That a balanced economic development highly essential to the welfare of this state be promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f)  That the reconversion from war time and civil defense economy to peace time pursuits be expedited by a program for readjustment of employment to accord with employment problems necessarily arising from changed conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(g)  That the present and prospective health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment and the general welfare of the citizens demand as a public purpose, the development within Tennessee of commercial, industrial, agricultural and manufacturing enterprises by the several municipalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(h)  That the means and measures herein authorized to promote such enterprises are, as a matter of public policy, for the public purposes of the several municipalities, and the state of Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)  That the present and prospective promotion of health, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment, and the general welfare of the state requires the measures that are herein and hereby authorized, and to that end will afford ready and attractive markets for farm and garden products, for the development of natural resources, and for the conversion of raw materials of farm, mine and forest into finished products for the general welfare of each of such municipalities, and the entire people of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(j)  That the accomplishment of the things herein authorized to be done by the several municipalities will give to them local benefits peculiar to each, and general benefits to the entire state.”

          The motion for the retaxation of criminal costs taxed and certified against a county is not barred, though not made at the first term of the court after judgment since the provisions of the statute do not limit the time within that such retaxation may be had, but it is the proper practice for the county executive (now county mayor) to make, as soon as may be, an examination of all bills of costs against the county and to move promptly for a retaxation in proper cases.

        While T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t05c14s5-14-114" target="_self">5-14-114</a></cite> is not unconstitutionally vague, it is violative of equal protection guaranties. State v. Whitehead, 43 S.W.3d 921, 2000 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 742 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000).

        There is no fundamental right to a financial or “personal beneficial” interest in county contracts; moreover, the class of citizens to which T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t05c14s5-14-114" target="_self">5-14-114</a></cite> applies is not discrete, and in consequence, is not suspect.

       <p>
        The legislature's classification of a county official's conflict of interest with regard to a county contract as a Class D felony in only those counties adopting the County Purchasing Law of 1957 was purely arbitrary and could not withstand the defendant's equal protection challenge.

       It is the legislative intent that all counties in this state have certain minimum written personnel policies in effect in order to assist in maintaining compliance with applicable state and federal laws and to facilitate accurate recordkeeping. This chapter is not intended to affect the present authority within counties to adopt policies in addition to those required by this chapter, nor is it intended to enlarge, diminish or otherwise affect the obligation to comply with current state and federal laws governing personnel matters. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impose any liability on any county government for failure to have written personnel policies in place, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law.
