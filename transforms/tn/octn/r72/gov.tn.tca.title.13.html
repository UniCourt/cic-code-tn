         The procedural steps which the general assembly has put in place in the form of enabling statutes governing the enactment of zoning ordinances usually are regarded as mandatory, and a failure substantially to comply with such requirements renders the zoning ordinance invalid.

           Orders dismissing a local government's amended complaint against the second real estate developer for failure to state a claim and granting the first developer summary judgment in the government's action seeking to force the developers to complete a road or to pay damages were vacated because the ordinance approving the project, Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, Ordinance No. 88-491, provided a sufficient legal basis for requiring both developers to build and pave the missing section of the road; the ordinance specifically referred to and incorporated the project's preliminary master plan, which included the road, and the first developer's transfer of the property to the second developer did not terminate its legal obligation to build and pave the road. The court further held that the conditions and requirements of the preliminary master plan were binding not only on the first developer but on the second developer as well; the second developer's omission of the middle of the road from the final subdivision plats approved by the planning commission did not absolve it of its legal obligation to finish the road.

          A regional planning commission may adopt the regional plan as a whole by a single resolution, or, as the work of making the plan progresses, may from time to time adopt a part or parts thereof. The commission may from time to time amend, extend or add to the plan or carry any part of the plan into greater detail. Prior to the adoption of the plan or any part, amendment or addition to the plan, the commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, the time and place of which shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting in which the adoption is to be first considered. The adoption of the plan or any part, amendment or addition shall be by resolution carried by the affirmative votes of not less than a majority of the membership of the commission. The resolution shall refer to the maps and descriptive matter intended by the commission to form the whole or part of the plan, and the action taken shall be recorded on the map or maps and descriptive matter by the identifying signature of the secretary of the commission.

Any municipal planning commission which receives any such certification may adopt, as a part or amendment of or addition to the plan of the municipality, so much of the regional plan or part or amendment thereof, or addition thereto as falls within the territory of the municipality, and when so adopted, it shall have the same force and effect as though made and prepared, as well as adopted, by such municipal planning commission.

The county legislative body, by resolution or the municipal legislative body by ordinance, may adopt the general regional plan, or in the case of the municipality, their element of the plan as certified by the planning commission. Prior to the adoption of the general regional plan or amendment of the general regional plan by a legislative body, the legislative body shall hold a public hearing thereon, the time and place of which shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting in which the adoption or amendment is to be first considered. If the legislative body adopts the general regional plan in the form of an ordinance by the municipality or a resolution by the county, then any land use decisions thereafter made by the legislative body, planning commission or board of zoning appeals when the board of zoning appeals is exercising its powers on matters other than variances, must be consistent with the general regional plan.

            Orders dismissing a local government's amended complaint against the second real estate developer for failure to state a claim and granting the first developer summary judgment in the government's action seeking to force the developers to complete a road or to pay damages were vacated because the ordinance approving the project, Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, Ordinance No. 88-491, provided a sufficient legal basis for requiring both developers to build and pave the missing section of the road; the ordinance specifically referred to and incorporated the project's preliminary master plan, which included the road, and the first developer's transfer of the property to the second developer did not terminate its legal obligation to build and pave the road. The court further held that the conditions and requirements of the preliminary master plan were binding not only on the first developer but on the second developer as well; the second developer's omission of the middle of the road from the final subdivision plats approved by the planning commission did not absolve it of its legal obligation to finish the road.

Where allowed under the prevailing local authority, the municipal planning commission may also contract, within funds appropriated by the legislative body for this purpose, with planners or other experts for such services as it may require. In the absence of such authority, only the municipality may contract for such services. The appropriate financial official of the municipality, city or town, within the funds appropriated by the legislative body for this purpose, will disperse funds for the salary or salaries of the planning director and staff and the operational expenses of the planning office and the contracted services of planners or other experts retained to provide assistance to and studies, plans, reviews and reports for the municipal planning commission. The municipal planning commission may also, through the legislative body, receive and expend funds from grants, gifts, contracts, fees, and appropriations from federal, state, other local governments or private sources for the purpose of carrying on its planning functions.

Protection and encouragement of access to sunlight for solar energy systems may be considered in promulgating zoning regulations pursuant to this section. Quarrying shall be uniformly defined, for purposes of all county zoning regulations, as the extraction, removal and mechanized processing of stone, gravel, phosphate rock, metallic ore, limestone, marble, chert, sand, dimension stone and any other solid mineral or substance of commercial value, except coal and deep metal mining, including, but not limited to zinc, found in natural deposits in the earth, for barter or sale. The definition of quarrying shall not include the reuse of these minerals on the same site from which they are extracted. This definition shall have no effect on the exception contained in § 54-1-128. The removal of borrow material from a site and the placement of the same material on a project site without any mechanized processing shall not be considered quarrying.

        A board of zoning appeals' power is limited in scope to that expressly conferred by statute. Father Ryan High School, Inc. v. Oak Hill, 774 S.W.2d 184, 1988 Tenn. App. LEXIS 725 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The procedural steps which the general assembly has put in place in the form of enabling statutes governing the enactment of zoning ordinances usually are regarded as mandatory, and a failure substantially to comply with such requirements renders the zoning ordinance invalid. Hutcherson v. Criner, 11 S.W.3d 126, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 461 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999), rehearing denied, — S.W.3d —, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 542 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 1999).
       </p>

All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout any such district, but the regulations in one (1) district may differ from those in other districts. The regional planning commission may make and certify a single plan for all the territory of the county which lies within the region but outside of municipal corporations, or may make and certify separate and successive plans for parts of such territory which it deems to be suitable for urban or nonurban development or which for other reasons it deems to be an appropriate territorial unit for a zone plan; and correspondingly, any ordinance enacted by the county legislative body may cover and include the whole territory of the county which lies within the region but outside of municipal corporations covered and included in any such single plan or in any such separate and successive plans. No ordinance covering more or less than the entire area covered by any such certified plan shall be enacted or put into effect until or unless it is first submitted to the regional planning commission and is approved by the commission or, if disapproved, shall receive the favorable vote of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the entire membership of the county legislative body.

        Where notice of a proposed zoning reclassification to allow a shooting range involved ten acres, but the adopted resolution stated ninety acres, the ordinance was void ab initio and the statute of limitations was no defense because: (1) The resolution qualified as a zoning amendment which required specific procedures; (2) The county legislative body had no jurisdiction to act on the proposed amendment since the alteration was so substantial that there should have been a resubmission of the proposed amendment to the planning commission; and (3) The record did not establish the requisite public or private reliance for an exception to the application of the void ab initio doctrine.

The county legislative body shall be the appointing power of the members of such board of appeals and may fix their compensation and their terms, which terms shall be of such length and so arranged that the term of one (1) member will expire each year. In any county which has adopted a charter form of government as provided in the Constitution of Tennessee, article VII, § 1, and by § 5-1-201, and which has a population of less than six hundred thousand (600,000), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, the county legislative body shall arrange their terms in any fashion so long as no member's term exceeds five (5) years in length. The county legislative body may remove any member for cause upon written charges and after a public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms in the same manner as in the case of original appointments. The county legislative body may appoint associate members of the board, and, in the event that any regular member be temporarily unable to act owing to absence from the county, illness, interest in a case before the board, or other cause, such associate member's place may be taken during such temporary disability by an associate member designated for the purpose by the county legislative body. The county legislative bodies of two (2) or more counties may, by ordinances enacted by both or all of them, arrange and provide for a joint or common board of zoning appeals.

        Where notice of a proposed zoning reclassification to allow a shooting range involved ten acres, but the adopted resolution stated ninety acres, the ordinance was void ab initio and the statute of limitations was no defense because: (1) The resolution qualified as a zoning amendment which required specific procedures; (2) The county legislative body had no jurisdiction to act on the proposed amendment since the alteration was so substantial that there should have been a resubmission of the proposed amendment to the planning commission; and (3) The record did not establish the requisite public or private reliance for an exception to the application of the void ab initio doctrine.

       <p>
   Based on the applicable definitions of “agriculture” and “agricultural,” concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) clearly involve “agricultural” activities and the “agricultural” use of land and structures. Thus, a county is not authorized to regulate CAFOs under its zoning powers or its general powers. T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.44.html#t44c18s44-18-104" target="_blank">44-18-104</a></cite> merely sets forth which zoning requirements and regulations apply when determining whether a feedlot, dairy farm, or poultry production house is to be afforded absolute immunity from a nuisance claim, but it does not provide authority for a county to enact zoning requirements or regulations. T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t13c07s13-7-114" target="_self">13-7-114</a></cite>, which prevents counties from using their zoning power to regulate structures and land used for agricultural purposes, is not in conflict with T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.44.html#t44c18s44-18-104" target="_blank">44-18-104</a></cite> because there is no independent source of zoning power bestowed upon any local entity under this right-to-farm law. T.C.A §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.44.html#t44c18s44-18-104ol1b" target="_blank">44-18-104(b)</a></cite> and (d) do not direct compliance with the section when no zoning requirements or regulations exist. When no zoning requirements or regulations exist, these provisions convey that a person’s compliance with the section is deemed to be established as a matter of law. OAG 18-30, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 29 (7/6/2018).

   Owners and operators of a farm, who operated a pumpkin patch and corn maze and conducted concerts on their property, were protected from the application of the local zoning laws by the Tennessee Right-to-Farm Act, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.43.html#t43c26s43-26-101" target="_blank">43-26-101</a></cite> et seq., because their farm activities were sufficient to meet the definition of agritourism.

        Music concerts a neighbor hosted on his farm could not claim the benefit of the exemption from compliance with a county's zoning resolution because they did not fall within the rubric of “agriculture”; without the exemption, a homeowner's evidence established that the neighbor violated both the county zoning resolution and the order of the county board of zoning appeals limiting the concerts to one per year.

        While the statutory definitions of “agriculture” include recreational and educational activities, they do not include entertainment activities; therefore, entertainment activities occurring on a farm are not an agricultural use that exempts the related land, buildings, or other structures from local zoning regulation.

         This section and the municipal code provision require that if a proposed zoning ordinance is amended so substantially that a new proposal is created, it must be resubmitted to the planning commission for its consideration before the municipal legislative body may finally act upon it, as to hold otherwise would defeat the clear intent of the statutory requirement that the legislative body have available, before it acts, the recommendations of the commission.

         As the purpose of requiring submission to the planning commission is to give the legislative body the advantage of the commission's expertise on land use planning with respect to the proposal that it must either adopt or reject the test on whether the bill must be resubmitted to the commission is whether the revision is so substantial as to create a strong probability that the commission's recommendation would have been affected by the revision.

         The test for determining whether a proposed zoning ordinance, as amended, must be resubmitted to a planning commission is not the same as the test for determining whether a proposed ordinance, as amended, must be passed on three different days because it became a new bill and the purposes of the two requirements are not identical.

         Where the only change in a proposed zoning ordinance was the creation of an area to remain R-2 that would constitute a 20-foot wide buffer zone facing the residential property inside the property to be rezoned B-2 and which would appear to be beneficial rather than detrimental to those who oppose it, the change was not so substantial that resubmission to the planning commission was required, because it was not likely to have any affect on the commission's recommendation. Wilgus v. Murfreesboro, 532 S.W.2d 50, 1975 Tenn. App. LEXIS 193 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1975).

         Eleventh-hour revisions to the Knox County zoning resolution concerning landfills were important and substantial enough to require the resubmission of the proposed amendments to the metropolitan planning commission.

         Where the landowner, who owned a historical property with a still functioning carriage house, sponsored activities that ranged from low key luncheons to fairly boisterous parties, there was material evidence to support the one-year permit restriction as the Metropolitan Davidson County Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) had an interest in ascertaining whether a permit holder was abiding by its conditions, and that was especially true given the record evidence of noise and other disturbances caused by the events, and also some prior violations; however, the BZAs imposition of certain clean up deadlines, and restrictions on the landowner's use of his front yard, were not supported by material evidence, as the issues in contention primarily concerned the levels of noise and traffic in the surrounding neighborhood.

         The board is not authorized to grant a variance when the only hardship to an owner in complying with a zoning regulation is the result of a condition existing not in the land itself but in a structure which was created or altered by an owner of the property in violation of the zoning ordinance.

         Pecuniary loss is insufficient by itself to justify a variance. McClurkan v. Board of Zoning Appeals, 565 S.W.2d 495, 1977 Tenn. App. LEXIS 276 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1977).

         The characteristics of the land itself are the overriding criteria by which the board is to decide the issue of hardship to an owner, although in some cases other factors presented by a variance applicant might be so closely related to these criteria that the board would be justified in considering them.

         Where the landowner, who owned a historical property with a still functioning carriage house, sponsored activities that ranged from low key luncheons to fairly boisterous parties, there was material evidence to support the one-year permit restriction as the Metropolitan Davidson County Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) had an interest in ascertaining whether a permit holder was abiding by its conditions, and that was especially true given the record evidence of noise and other disturbances caused by the events, and also some prior violations; however, the BZAs imposition of certain clean up deadlines, and restrictions on the landowner's use of his front yard, were not supported by material evidence, as the issues in contention primarily concerned the levels of noise and traffic in the surrounding neighborhood.

   City council had authority to enact Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, Zoning Ordinance, art.

   While it is true that the proper procedure for reviewing a decision of local boards of zoning appeals is the common law writ of certiorari, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t13c07s13-7-208" target="_self">13-7-208</a></cite>(a)(2) specifically allows certain parties to institute an injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent unlawful construction.

         Because an ordinance draws its effectiveness from the state zoning laws, the statute and the ordinance should be read in pari materia to avoid conflict and to enable them to operate concurrently. 421 Corp. v.

   T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t13c07s13-7-208" target="_self">13-7-208</a></cite> regarding changes to zoning ordinances is a “grandfather clause,” which has been described as an exception to a restriction that allows all those already doing something to continue doing it, even if they would be stopped by the new restriction. A grandfather clause exception in a statute must be construed strictly against the party who seeks to come within the exception. Lamar Tenn., L.L.C. v.

         To invoke the protection of this section, two requirements must be met: (1) There must be zoning where there previously was none, or there must be a change in zoning restrictions; and (2) There must be permissive operation of a business prior to the change.

         <p>
   The clear meaning of §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t13c07s13-7-208" target="_self">13-7-208</a></cite> is that the nonconforming use must be permitted by the zoning regulations, not permitted merely through lax enforcement.

   Zoning ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses and stating that any such business operating in violation of the ordinance at the time it was enacted was deemed a nonconforming use, and containing an amortization provision that permitted the nonconforming use to continue for not more than one year, was contrary to Tennessee law.

         Where billboards were prohibited in the area in question both before and after the enactment of this section and had been permitted to exist only because of lax enforcement of the zoning code by the county, the county was not estopped from enforcing the prohibition; this section did not apply to permit a landowner to remove and replace the billboards as a nonconforming use.

          <p>
           In a case in which petitioner applied for a permit to renovate a 1935 industrial building located within a historic preservation district, the evidence supported the trial court's determination that the zoning commission complied with the applicable statutes, ordinances, and design guidelines when it denied a permit for vertically operable windows. The trial court affirmed the commission's decision, based on its finding that a parapet wall would be more in keeping with the style of the original 1935 building and would harmonize the building with the rest of the district.

            Attorney General Opinions. Proposed legislation would establish a continued-use provision for short-term rental units, which would prohibit local governments from applying regulations and restrictions to short-term rental units that were in operation before the enactment of those regulations and restrictions. The legislation would not apply, however, to regulations and restrictions enacted by a local government before January 1, 2014.  By allowing some local governments to enforce their rules governing short-term rental units uniformly but preventing other local governments–namely those that enacted rules after January 1, 2014–from doing so, the proposed legislation does not constitute impermissible class legislation.  However, a provision which would allow some local governments to continue to prohibit short-term rentals but would prevent local governments that did not enact such laws prior to August 1, 2017, from doing so would, constitute impermissible class legislation.  The proposed legislation would also prevent a local government from considering the leasing of a residential dwelling as a short-term rental for purposes of determining land use or utility rates. This provision does not violate article II, section 28 of the Tennessee Constitution.  Furthermore, the proposed legislation does not otherwise violate the U.S. Constitution or Tennessee Constitution, including by effectively limiting the ability of a single county to restrict short-term rentals or by employing terms such as “effectively prohibit” and “reasonable compliance” that might be deemed too vague to provide meaningful guidance to local governments.

       The membership of boards created under this chapter shall consist of the county mayor of each county within the district, the mayor of each municipality within the district, the chief executive officer of any metropolitan government within the district, one (1) representative from a local agency in each county dealing with problems of industrial development or promotion appointed by the county mayor, and one (1) state senator and one (1) state representative whose senatorial or representative districts lie wholly or in part in the development district. The senator member shall be selected by the senators whose districts are wholly or in part within the development district. Senators and representatives shall serve on such boards for two (2) years or until they leave the general assembly, whichever occurs first. Senators whose districts lie wholly or partly within the development district shall meet at the call of the senior senator among those affected, for the purpose of selecting a member of the development district board, and representatives shall meet at the call of the senior representative for that purpose. Membership on such boards shall be for four (4) years or until the expiration of the term of the official by whom such representative was appointed, whichever occurs first. Members are subject to reappointment. The representative of each county and city government as indicated above may be chosen from an existing city or county planning commission. The board may appoint an executive committee to act for it and determine the authority of such committee. No member of the general assembly shall receive any additional compensation for such member's service on a board.

       “Declaration of policy. — The future growth of population in this state, the employment of its people, the proper utilization of its natural resources, and the strengthening of its economy will depend in large measure on growth of industry and related activities. In recent years, increasing numbers of plants seek location in industrial parks or districts where, in company with other plants, utilities and services may be jointly supplied, and in which suitable restrictions and standards of construction and performances may be applied. It is the intent of this act to facilitate the assembly of lands and the development of such industrial parks where feasible and necessary.”

        Notwithstanding this section, a municipality with a population not less than three hundred thousand (300,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall not be required to obtain a certificate of public purpose and necessity in order to borrow funds to develop an industrial park under this part. Any such municipality that makes a total pledge of full faith and credit of the municipality related to an industrial park project shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total assessed valuation of all property in the municipality, ascertained by the last completed assessment at the time of issuance of the obligations. In any resolution pledging the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power of any such municipality to secure any obligations related to the project, the governing body of the municipality shall state that the project being considered is well conceived, has a reasonable prospect for success, will provide proper economic development and employment, and will not likely become a burden on the taxpayers of the municipality.

        A city or county may exercise the power of eminent domain for development of an industrial park, only with respect to property located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city or county; or in the case of a city, also with respect to property within an urban growth boundary as defined in § 6-58-101; or in the case of a county, also with respect to property within an urban growth boundary or planned growth area as defined in § 6-58-101. Either a city or town and county, or both, operating a joint industrial park may exercise the power of eminent domain with respect to property located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county and within an urban growth boundary and a planned growth area. Before a city or county may undertake to exercise the power of eminent domain for development of an industrial park, it must obtain a certificate of public purpose and necessity as provided in subsection (a), even if no funds will be borrowed for the project, except:

          A certificate of public purpose and necessity for the exercise of eminent domain, in addition to the applicable findings set forth in subdivision (a)(1)(A), shall be based on a finding that the city or county has been unable, through good faith negotiations, to acquire the property to be acquired by eminent domain or any alternative property that would be of comparable suitability for the project. Good faith negotiations shall be established, if the city or county has made an offer to purchase the property for an amount equal to or in excess of the fair market value, determined by the average of at least two (2) appraisals by independent, qualified appraisers.

        Question of whether or not Public Acts 1935 (1st Ex. Sess.), §§ 24, 25 introduced other subjects into the act and were beyond the scope of the caption could not properly be raised where such sections were removed by Acts 1937, ch. 234, § 4. Knoxville Housing Authority, Inc. v. Knoxville, 174 Tenn. 76, 123 S.W.2d 1085, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of this statute and its caption providing for the conferring of the remedies on obligees of the housing authority are germane with the general purpose of the statute in creating such authority and do not deal with a subject distinct from the remainder of the statute. Knoxville Housing Authority, Inc. v. Knoxville, 174 Tenn. 76, 123 S.W.2d 1085, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1939).

   Acts 1935 (1st Ex. Sess.), ch. 20, was a constitutional enactment. Starr v. Nashville Housing Authority, 145 F. Supp. 498, 1956 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2631 (D.

        The Housing Authorities Law is not in violation of Tenn. Const., art. II, § 29, as an authorization of lending of public credit to a corporation without prior authorization by the electorate because the housing authority alone is liable on bonds issued and there is no lending of credit of either the municipality or the county. Metropolitan Development & Housing Agency v. Leech, 591 S.W.2d 427, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 524 (Tenn. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tax increment financing, provided for in the Housing Authorities Law, is not in violation of those parts of Tenn. Const., art. II, §§ 28 and 29, requiring all property to be taxed uniformly according to its value because past interpretations of taxing uniformity require only that the tax burden apply equally to all nonexempt property. Metropolitan Development & Housing Agency v. Leech, 591 S.W.2d 427, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 524 (Tenn. 1979).

        Inasmuch as this chapter were not mandatorily applicable to municipalities, Memphis housing authority as created by Priv. Acts 1935, ch. 615 was not unconstitutional because certain provisions of the private act were in conflict with the general law. Mink v. Memphis, 222 Tenn. 216, 435 S.W.2d 114, 1968 Tenn.

         “Slum clearance law” placing regulation of acquisition and disposal of property in blighted area in hands of housing authority does not violate Tenn. Const., art. II, §§ 1, 2. Nashville Housing Authority v. Nashville, 192 Tenn. 103, 237 S.W.2d 946, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 387 (1951).

         “Slum clearance law” providing for clearing of “slums” by destruction of old and dilapidated dwellings and old and dilapidated industrial and commercial buildings for purpose of redevelopment is a valid exercise of right of eminent domain under the police power for purpose of removing health, crime, and fire hazards and does not violate Tenn. Const., art. I, §§ 8, 21; art. XI, § 8 or U.S. Const., amend. 14, since acquisition and disposition of property in area is incidental to the primary purpose of the act. Nashville Housing Authority v.

   A housing authority as a redevelopment agency must approach the problem of blighted areas of the community on an area, rather than a structure by structure, basis and it is immaterial that some particular structure within such area may be safe, sound and well-kept.

             The general assembly finds and declares that:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol11">
              There are areas in counties and municipalities of this state that have a transit deficiency where the absence of facilities for high capacity transit options constitutes a serious and growing menace that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of residents;
             </li>
             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol12">
              The existence of such transit-deficient areas constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous burdens that substantially impair or arrest sound growth, aggravate traffic problems, and substantially hamper the elimination of traffic hazards, the implementation of solutions to traffic congestion, and the improvement of traffic facilities;
             </li>
             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol13">
              The prevention and elimination of such transit-deficient areas is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state and its counties and municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by such areas;

             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol14">
              Certain transit-deficient areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition, subject to use restrictions, as provided in this part, since the prevailing conditions make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation;

             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol15">
              Other areas, or portions thereof, may, through the means provided in this part, be susceptible to conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils enumerated may be eliminated, remedied, or prevented;
             </li>
             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol16">
              Such areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action to decrease vehicular congestion for residents, provide suitable density for development, and prevent sprawl into rural areas of the state, and through the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas; and
             </li>
             <li id="t13c20s13-20-701ol17">
              The powers conferred under this part are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and police power exercised, and the necessity in the public interest is declared as a matter of legislative determination.

If the structure is removed or demolished by the public officer, the public officer shall sell the materials of such structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the chancery court by the public officer, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the person found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or otherwise.

   The agency shall establish a housing cost index as defined in §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t13c23s13-23-103" target="_self">13-23-103</a></cite> to be computed monthly or at such time or times as the agency in its discretion may require. The housing cost index shall serve to determine what percentage of the average Tennessee household's gross monthly income is required to pay for primary fixed housing costs under then existing housing market conditions and to establish a basis for a threshold at which the financial assistance programs of this chapter will become effective. Thus, it is hereby found and declared that when primary housing costs, as defined by the housing cost index, reach or exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of an average Tennessee household's gross monthly income, a majority of Tennessee citizens are excluded from the normal housing market; and, in light of that finding, when the housing cost index reaches or exceeds a factor of twenty-five percent (25%) and upon the approval of the board of directors, the financial assistance programs established in this chapter will become operative to aid in providing adequate housing for lower and moderate income persons and families as defined by §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t13c23s13-23-103" target="_self">13-23-103</a></cite>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the agency may at any time approve the operation of the financial assistance programs of this chapter with the affirmative vote of nine (9) members of its board of directors.

Except as provided herein, the agency may make such loans directly only after the agency has notified all qualified lenders with whom the agency has working agreements of a sponsor's, developer's, builder's, or purchaser's pending loan application and after a reasonable time from the date of notification, no qualified lender has agreed in writing with such qualified sponsor, developer, or builder or with such qualified purchaser to make an insured mortgage loan either as mortgagee, or as an agent for a mortgagee upon reasonably equivalent terms and conditions.

        For purposes of this chapter, “limited distribution entity” means a corporation, trust, partnership, association, individual or other entity regulated by the agency as to the amount of distribution, retirement of capital investment, or redemption of stock or other ownership interest, in such a manner that any such distribution, retirement, or redemption will not exceed in any one (1) fiscal year ten percent (10%), or such lesser percentage as shall be prescribed by the rules and regulations of the agency, of such limited distribution entity's equity in a nonowner-occupied residential housing development. The limited distribution entity's equity in the development shall consist of the difference between the agency mortgage loan on the development and the total project cost. By regulation, the agency shall prescribe the categories of costs constituting “total project cost,” including organizational expenses, land acquisition, plans and specifications, interest and financing charges paid during construction, construction costs, architects, engineering, legal and accounting fees, and a reasonable builder's profit and job overhead. A limited distribution entity's equity in a nonowner-occupied residential housing development shall be established by the agency resolution approving the mortgage loan. For the purposes of this subsection (c), that equity shall remain constant during the life of the agency mortgage loan on such housing development, except for additional equity investment made by the limited distribution entity after agency approval. Should the limited distribution entity accumulate earned surplus in addition to such maintenance and replacement reserves as the agency may require in excess of ten percent (10%) of the first full year's proposed annual rent roll, the agency may direct that the development's rents be reduced to the extent necessary to lower the earned surplus accumulation to the ten percent (10%) (or such lesser percent as the agency shall have prescribed by its rules and regulations) return on equity factor established at the granting of the agency mortgage loan.

        Because the plaintiff landowners could claim no constitutionally recognized property right to maintain zoning restrictions which previously barred group homes from their neighborhood, even where the lifting of the restrictions might cause a diminution of property values, the provisions of this part, which did not restrict the use of plaintiffs' property, but merely lifted restrictions imposed by local ordinance and permitted others to use their property for a broader range of purposes than the local zoning permitted, were not a taking of property and did not violate U.S. Const., amend. 5 or Tenn. Const., art. I, § 8. Nichols v. Tullahoma Open Door, Inc., 640 S.W.2d 13, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 478 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

       For the purposes of any zoning law in Tennessee, the classification “single family residence” includes any home in which eight (8) or fewer unrelated persons with disabilities reside, and may include three (3) additional persons acting as support staff or guardians, who need not be related to each other or to any of the persons with disabilities residing in the home.

       The chief elected public officials of various counties and/or cities of the economic development districts established under chapter 14 of this title, are empowered to create a human resource agency. It is the intent of this chapter that there may be four (4) metropolitan human resource agencies, Memphis-Shelby, Nashville-Davidson, Knoxville-Knox, Chattanooga-Hamilton, and no more than nine (9) rural human resource agencies, coterminous with the boundary lines of the development districts. It is the further intent of this chapter that the agencies so created may be the delivery system for human resources, and in no way an infringement on the planning functions of the development districts.

      The legislature finds and declares as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13c30s13-30-102ol11">
       Tennessee's communities are important to the social and economic vitality of the state. Whether urban, suburban or rural, many communities are struggling to cope with vacant, abandoned and tax-delinquent properties;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c30s13-30-102ol12">
       There exists a crisis in many cities and their metro areas caused by disinvestment in real property and resulting in a significant amount of vacant and abandoned property. This condition of vacant and abandoned property represents lost revenue to local governments and large costs associated with demolition, safety hazards and spreading deterioration of neighborhoods including resulting mortgage foreclosures;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c30s13-30-102ol13">
       The need exists to strengthen and revitalize the economy of the state and its local units of government by solving the problems of vacant and abandoned property in a coordinated manner and to foster the development of such property and promote economic growth. Such problems may include multiple taxing jurisdictions lacking common policies, ineffective property inspection, code enforcement and property rehabilitation support, lengthy and/or inadequate foreclosure proceedings, and lack of coordination and resources to support economic revitalization;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c30s13-30-102ol14">
       There is an overriding public need to confront the problems caused by vacant, abandoned and tax-delinquent properties through the creation of new tools to be available to communities throughout the state enabling them to turn vacant spaces into vibrant places;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c30s13-30-102ol15">
       Land banks are one of the tools that can be utilized by communities to facilitate the return of vacant, abandoned and tax-delinquent properties to productive use.
