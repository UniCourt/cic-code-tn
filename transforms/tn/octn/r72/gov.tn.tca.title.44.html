        An owner of animals is not liable for damages caused to the crop of another by his animals, if they are not running at large by reason of his fault or negligence, where they escaped from a pasture enclosed with a lawful fence, or by an ordinary fence such as generally required to restrain that kind of stock.

         The statutes regulating partition fences apply to farms in the country, and not to lots in towns and cities. Lightfoot v. Grove, 52 Tenn. 473, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 281 (1871).
        </p>
        <p>
         The statutes are compulsory on adjoining landowners, where, as the provisions in relation to crops imply, the lands are cultivated. The fence in such case is equally beneficial to both parties, and the statutes require that they contribute equally to the expense of constructing and maintaining it. Neither has the right to remove such fence, or to allow his part of it to be out of repair, when there is an agreement that each shall keep a certain part of the fence in good repair. Brown v. Sams, 119 Tenn. 677, 109 S.W. 513, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1907).
        </p>
        <p>
         Fence posts were placed on the land by both the plaintiff landowner's and the defendant landowners'  predecessors in interest in their attempt to comply with a court order in a previous lawsuit; therefore, plaintiff should be responsible for a portion of the cost of relocating the fence posts. Based on testimony that the land was being used as a farm, it appeared that T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c08s44-8-201" target="_self">44-8-201</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c08s44-8-202" target="_self">44-8-202</a></cite> applied. Polos v. Shields, — S.W.3d —, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 625 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2009), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. LEXIS 108 (Tenn. Feb. 22, 2010).

         The provisions of this and the following sections relating to partition fences are compulsory on adjoining owners of cultivated land, and one who omits his duty in that regard is liable for damages if his stock breaks over into his neighbor's land and destroys his crop. Brown v. Sams, 119 Tenn. 677, 109 S.W. 513, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1907).

         Where the obligation to maintain a fence is the mutual responsibility of each party, a party finding livestock upon his property is obligated to make the necessary repairs. The parties, by neglecting their duties to maintain the fence, cannot recover for their losses. Wills v. Potter, 730 S.W.2d 327, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2463 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).

         Fence posts were placed on the land by both the plaintiff landowner's and the defendant landowners'  predecessors in interest in their attempt to comply with a court order in a previous lawsuit; therefore, plaintiff should be responsible for a portion of the cost of relocating the fence posts. Based on testimony that the land was being used as a farm, it appeared that T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c08s44-8-201" target="_self">44-8-201</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c08s44-8-202" target="_self">44-8-202</a></cite> applied.

         Defendants'  motion to dismiss was granted with regard to the partition fence because plaintiff failed to introduce into evidence any support for her claim regarding what she referred to as a partition fence; plaintiff testified that there was a fence on the boundary line between her property and defendants'  property that was in need of repair and/or replacement, but she did not establish how the fence came to be where it was, much less that defendants were liable for its repair or replacement.

         A partition fence upon the line between adjoining landowners may be erected and kept in repair at their joint expense; and when the fence is constructed, they may agree that each shall keep a particular part thereof in repair, and the one failing to discharge this duty is liable to the other for all damages that may result from such failure. Where one fails to discharge this duty, and, in consequence, damages result to him, on account of the injuries done to his crops by the other's hogs that passed through that part of the fence that he failed to keep in repair according to the agreement, he cannot recover the damages, because he cannot complain of an injury that was the direct result of his own wrong. Brown v. Sams, 119 Tenn. 677, 109 S.W. 513, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 29 (1907).

         Where the obligation to maintain a fence is the mutual responsibility of each party, a party finding livestock upon his property is obligated to make the necessary repairs. The parties, by neglecting their duties to maintain the fence, cannot recover for their losses. Wills v. Potter, 730 S.W.2d 327, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2463 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).

         It is lawful for two (2) or more owners of adjoining farms to enclose the same under one (1) common fence or enclosure, to be kept up to the standard of a lawful fence by each owner upon that owner's own land, or in such manner and proportion as the owners may agree upon in writing. In the absence of an agreement, the owner of any of the land embraced in the common fence shall be liable to the owners of the other lands and their tenants for all damages to their lands, pastures, fruit trees, crops, or vegetables, occasioned by the failure or neglect of the other owner to keep and maintain the common fence on that owner's land up to the standard of a lawful fence, or by the owner's own stock or that of the owner's tenants trespassing beyond the owner's own land within the common enclosure.

         It is lawful to prescribe, in such an agreement, the means and method by which the common enclosure shall be constructed and maintained, regulations for the use and enjoyment by each owner of the lands embraced in the enclosure, the penalties to be imposed upon each for violations and how the penalties shall be imposed, the mode of assessment of damages occasioned by trespassing stock of the parties to the agreement, and the length of time it shall continue in force. The agreement may also provide for impounding, feeding, and caring for trespassing stock of the parties to the agreement found within the common enclosure, and for a lien upon trespassing stock to secure the penalties and damages assessed against the owner on that account, and for the enforcement of the lien by sale. All such provisions, not in violation of any law, shall be binding upon all parties to the agreement.

           Where dog was allowed to come and go at will while owners were away from home, such animal was at large within the meaning of this section. Alex v. Armstrong, 215 Tenn. 276, 385 S.W.2d 110, 1964 Tenn. LEXIS 564 (Tenn. Dec. 11, 1964).

           In personal injury action by pedestrian for injuries received when struck by automobile after it skidded on wet pavement while driver was attempting to avoid pedestrian's dog, where record showed that dog had left pedestrian and started diagonally down and across highway when accident occurred, trial court did not err in submitting to jury questions of whether dog was “at large” in violation of statute and, if so, whether violation of statute proximately caused or contributed to plaintiff's injuries.

          </p>
          <p>
           For cases where the dog caused injury on its owner's property, the statute clearly retains and codifies the common law requirement that a claimant establish that the dog's owner knew or should have known of the dog's dangerous propensities. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c08s44-8-413ol1c1" target="_self">44-8-413(c)(1)</a></cite> (2007). Moore v. Gaut, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 995 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2015).

          <p>
           Upon a plain reading of the statute, giving the word “any” its natural and ordinary meaning, the Dog Bite Statute applies to each and every civil suit falling within the specific category of cases dealt with by subsection (c)(1); the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, and subsection (c)(1) of the Dog Bite Statute abrogates common law claims falling within its parameters. Searcy v. Axley, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 699 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2017).

           Where parents claimed that a dog injured their child while on its owners'  property, they had to comply with the substantive requirements of the Dog Bite Statute. Searcy v. Axley, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 699 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2017).

           Trial court properly found on summary judgment that the dog owner, by testifying in his affidavit that his dog never bit or attacked anyone before the satellite dish worker, had negated the element of knowledge or notice of the dog's dangerous propensity, especially since all of the evidence tended to show that the owner believed his dog was friendly, gentle, and jovial before the bite occurred, it was undisputed that the dog did not get outside the fence, and the worker was the one who approached the dog. Moore v. Gaut, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 995 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2015).
          </p>
          <p>
           In parents'  action seeking to recover for their child's injury, the trial court properly granted dog owners summary judgment because they did not know nor should they have known that the dog had dangerous propensities; every witness testified that other than jumping on and scratching people, the dog had shown no vicious or dangerous behavior, and the evidence showed that the owners were concerned about the child being merely scratched, not that they had any knowledge that the dog was dangerous. Searcy v. Axley, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 699 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2017).

           Sheriff's department was not entitled to summary judgment, when a police officer sought to recover compensatory damages for personal injury caused by a police dog, because the officer was bitten by the department's police dog while pursuing a suspect. Thus, the act or conduct that prompted the need for the services of the police dog was the fleeing suspect, not the officer's request for assistance in the pursuit of the suspect. Greenlee v. Sevier Cty., — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 223 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2018).

     <p>
      Each livestock market may be under the direct supervision of a representative of the department. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no livestock known to be infected with or known to have been exposed to any contagious, infectious or communicable animal disease or infestation shall be consigned to or sold through any livestock market. The representative may inspect all livestock that is offered for sale and may prohibit the movement of any animals that in the representative's opinion are diseased or that are likely to be carriers of disease, until final inspection is made by a qualified, accredited veterinarian, as to their condition. If, upon examination, an infectious, contagious or communicable disease or infestation is found, such animals may be sold only for immediate slaughter to a recognized slaughterer where veterinary inspection is maintained; or, the owner may, upon submission of an affidavit of ownership for at least sixty (60) days prior to sale date, return them to the original premises, where a strict quarantine must be maintained. The representative shall also issue or cause to be issued all necessary quarantines for such animals as are sold for immediate slaughter or are returned to the original premises. A copy of the quarantine shall be sent to the state veterinarian immediately following issuance, and instructions given the owner that the truck moving the quarantined animals to slaughter or returning them to the original premises must be cleaned and disinfected before being used again to transport livestock. The representative shall supervise the cleaning and disinfecting of the yards and pens at such time as may be necessary, using only those disinfectants approved by the animal disease eradication branch of the agricultural research service of the United States department of agriculture.

      <li id="t44c15s44-15-101ol1b">
       Honeybees are kept in beehives by beekeepers throughout the state, and many colonies of feral honeybees have established nests in hollow trees and in walls of buildings. These honeybees perform a pollination function that is essential to the propagation of many species of flowering plants in Tennessee. These flowering plants include many agricultural crops, wildflowers, and forest plants that are of great importance to all Tennesseans, and the honeybees are the major pollinator for most of these plants. Therefore, the state should take appropriate actions to help assure the continued availability of an adequate population of honeybee pollinators. Honeybees, like other animal species, are afflicted by a variety of contagious diseases and pests that can cause serious population reductions. The natural behavior of honeybees cause them to be interactive with bees from other colonies and therefore vulnerable to transmission of some diseases and pests. Therefore, persons involved in the keeping of bees in a given area can engage in beekeeping practices that will have a real and direct impact on the honeybees and beekeeping in surrounding areas. This chapter enables and provides for the development of regulatory programs for beekeeping activities in the state as may be needed to help protect honeybees from diseases, pests, and other threats that could seriously reduce the availability of the honeybee pollinators.

      Attorney General Opinions. Based on the applicable definitions of “agriculture” and “agricultural,” concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) clearly involve “agricultural” activities and the “agricultural” use of land and structures. Thus, a county is not authorized to regulate CAFOs under its zoning powers or its general powers. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c18s44-18-104" target="_self">44-18-104</a></cite> merely sets forth which zoning requirements and regulations apply when determining whether a feedlot, dairy farm, or poultry production house is to be afforded absolute immunity from a nuisance claim, but it does not provide authority for a county to enact zoning requirements or regulations. T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.13.html#t13c07s13-7-114" target="_blank">13-7-114</a></cite>, which prevents counties from using their zoning power to regulate structures and land used for agricultural purposes, is not in conflict with T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c18s44-18-104" target="_self">44-18-104</a></cite> because there is no independent source of zoning power bestowed upon any local entity under this right-to-farm law. T.C.A § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c18s44-18-104ol1b" target="_self">44-18-104(b)</a></cite> and (d) do not direct compliance with the section when no zoning requirements or regulations exist. When no zoning requirements or regulations exist, these provisions convey that a person’s compliance with the section is deemed to be established as a matter of law. OAG 18-30, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 29 (7/6/2018).

      The general assembly recognizes that persons who participate in equine activities may incur injuries as a result of the risks involved in such activities. The general assembly also finds that the state and its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from these activities. It is, therefore, the intent of the general assembly to encourage equine activities by limiting the civil liability of those involved in such activities.

       Defendants were denied summary judgment in a personal injury suit filed by an injured horseback rider, in part, because it was not clear, based on the allegations in the rider's complaint, that the Tennessee Equine Activities Act, T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c20s44-20-101" target="_self">44-20-101</a></cite> et seq., provides immunity to defendants in the suit. Disputed issues of material fact existed as to whether the rider's fall was the result of an inherent risk of horseback riding, which would be covered by the act, or whether her injuries resulted from the provision of faulty tack and/or from defendants' willful disregard for the rider's safety, both of which are exempted from statutory protection under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t44c20s44-20-104" target="_self">44-20-104</a></cite>.
