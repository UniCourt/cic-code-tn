       <p>
   The defense of the statute of limitations, where a complete bar to an action, cannot be taken away by statute or constitution. Girdner v. Stephens, 48 Tenn. 280, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 48, 2 Am. Rep. 700 (1870); Yancy v. Yancy, 52 Tenn. 353, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 268, 13 Am. Rep. 5 (1871); Campbell v. Holt, <cite class="us_code">115 U.S. 620</cite>, <cite class="s_court">6 S.

       The statute of limitations of the law of the forum must prevail. Harris v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 248 F. Supp. 599, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6033 (E.D. Tenn. 1965).

        3. Liberal Construction in Favor of Imperiled Right.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While it is the duty of the courts to enforce statutes of limitation, it is just and reasonable that a liberal construction be adopted, and the courts are not bound to give such statutes that construction which will operate most prejudicially to those whose remedies and rights are to be forfeited by them, but rather in favor of the right which in all such cases is imperiled. Elder v. Bradley, 34 Tenn. 247, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1854).

       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Statutes of limitation are looked upon by the courts with favor as statutes of repose, and are as much favored as any other defense. Coleson v. Blanton, 4 Tenn. 152, 1816 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1816); Patten v. Standard Oil Co., 165 Tenn. 438, 55 S.W.2d 759, 1932 Tenn. LEXIS 70 (1933); West v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 108 F. Supp. 276, 1952 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2250 (D.

       Statutes of limitation apply to the cause of action, and not to the form of the suit. The cause of action, and not its form, determines which statute of limitation is applicable. Callaway v. McMillian, 58 Tenn. 557, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 299 (1872), superseded by statute as stated in, Pioneer Bank v. Kelley, — S.W.2d —, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 599 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 21, 1994).

       The applicable statute of limitations to a particular cause is determined according to the gravamen of the complaint. Headrick v. Union Carbide Corp. (Linde Div.), 825 S.W.2d 424, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 584 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991), appeal denied, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 230 (Tenn. Mar. 9, 1992).

       Before the statutes of limitation can operate to bar an action, there must be, for the requisite period, a person capable of suing, one that can be sued, and a court in which to sue.

       Where the legal title to the property is vested in the trustee, under a continuing trust, with the right, power, and capacity to sue, the cestui que trust is likewise barred when the trustee is barred by any statute of limitations. Ferguson v. Kennedy, 7 Tenn. 321, 1824 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1824); Williams v. Otey, 27 Tenn. 563, 1847 Tenn. LEXIS 133 (1847); Wooldridge v. Planters' Bank, 33 Tenn. 297, 1853 Tenn.

However, the bill must allege the fraudulent and effective concealment of the cause of action until within the period of limitation for the particular action, and such allegation must be proved unless admitted.

       A false representation knowingly made by a vendor, reputed to be a man of integrity and veracity, that he has full title to land sold which lies in another county, is a fraudulent concealment of the cause of action for the fraud unless there be shown some circumstance or incident connected with the transaction calculated to put the vendee on inquiry.

       There can be no concealment where there are no dealings between the parties. Mere silence does not constitute concealment.

   To prove fraudulent concealment for the purposes of tolling a statute of limitations, a party must show: (1) wrongful concealment of their actions by defendants; (2) failure of the plaintiff to discover the operative facts that are the basis of his cause of action within the limitations period; and (3) plaintiff's due diligence until discovery of the facts.

       Since replications to answers in chancery have been abolished, the complainant must, in order to avoid the anticipated plea of the bar of the statutes of limitation which have apparently barred the action, specifically and well allege in the original bill the necessary facts to show the arrest of the operation of the statute, or if not so pleaded in the original bill, and the defendant pleads or relies on the bar of the statute, then the complainant must so plead by amendment.

       Where a statute of limitations which would ordinarily bar the action has run, any intervening fact, such as disability of complainant, fraudulent concealment of the cause of action, nonresidence of the defendant, or a promise to pay within the period of limitation, must be alleged in the original bill, or in an amendment, when made necessary by a defense set up in the answer, and without such allegation, evidence of such fact is irrelevant and inadmissible for any purpose.

       Wife's account against her husband is not barred where the husband promised to pay same, as in mortgage securing the indebtedness, which kept it alive as to limitation. Robertson v. Wade, 17 Tenn. App. 457, 68 S.W.2d 487, 1933 Tenn. App. LEXIS 80 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1933).

      <p>
       Where a note has become barred by the statute of limitations, the bar can be removed only by an express promise to pay, or an acknowledgment of the debt accompanied by an expression of willingness to pay it. Hall v. Skidmore, 26 Tenn. App. 189, 168 S.W.2d 800, 1942 Tenn. App. LEXIS 32 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1942), overruled, Graves v. Sawyer, 588 S.W.2d 542, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 497 (Tenn. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a debtor continued to pay the interest due on a note after the statute of limitations had run, the bar of the statute of limitations was not removed since Tennessee requires not only an acknowledgment of the debt, which the payment of the interest was, but also an expression of willingness to pay it and mere payment of interest is not sufficient by itself to indicate this willingness. Hall v. Skidmore, 26 Tenn. App. 189, 168 S.W.2d 800, 1942 Tenn. App. LEXIS 32 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1942), overruled, Graves v. Sawyer, 588 S.W.2d 542, 1979 Tenn. LEXIS 497 (Tenn. 1979).

       The express waiver of the defense of the statute of limitations revives a barred debt, and postpones the bar of the statute for a new statutory period from that date, and gives to an unbarred debt a new statutory period of limitation from that date, but the waiver does not bind the party never to plead the statutory bar.

      <p>
       The retrospective application of the 1985 amendment to this section which added the last sentence, is remedial and does not impair a vested right of the defendant in the statute of limitations and is constitutional. Morford v. Yong Kyun Cho, 732 S.W.2d 617, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2605 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of repose does not violate state or federal constitutional due process or equal protection provisions. Via v. General Electric Co., 799 F. Supp. 837, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14532 (W.D. Tenn. 1992).
      </p>

       The statute is for the benefit of a plaintiff whose first case has been dismissed without a hearing on its merits. Reed v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 136 Tenn. 499, 190 S.W. 458, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 154 (1916).

      <p>
       This statute, permitting a new action by plaintiff whose right of action has not been concluded by the disposition of the case, is remedial, and is to be liberally construed, but protection against laches, negligence, or other fault of the plaintiff was no part of its purpose, nor was it intended to hold open the way indefinitely for vexatious and harassing continuation or renewal of litigation. Moran v. Weinberger, 149 Tenn. 537, 260 S.W. 966, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       The letter of this section as well as the spirit which prompted its enactment shows its basic purpose was to aid the courts in administering the law fairly between litigants without binding them to minor and technical mistakes made by their counsel in interpreting the complexities of the laws of procedure. General Acci. Fire & Life Assurance Corp. v. Kirkland, 210 Tenn. 39, 356 S.W.2d 283, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 410 (1962).

       The saving statute was designed to protect diligent suitors, those whose timely filed complaints put their defendants on notice that the complainants intended to assert their legal rights. Lee v. Crenshaw, 622 F.2d 202, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 18770 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1980).

       This section is remedial and should be liberally construed to insure to a diligent suitor a hearing in court until he reaches a judgment on the merits, thus where an action for wrongful death was brought in federal court, under diversity of citizenship, against joint tort-feasors, and plaintiff took a voluntary nonsuit, another action could be brought within one year, against a single wrongdoer, since failure to join other defendant would not increase remaining defendant's liability, or alter facts for recovery or defense.

       This section addresses itself to time while Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01 addresses itself to the number of dismissals (nonsuits) that can be taken; thus there is no conflict between the statute and the rule. Payne v. Matthews, 633 S.W.2d 494, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 477 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982).

       Where a person is made a party, then voluntarily dismissed, then made a party again more than a year later, through an amended complaint in a continuing action against another person, the statute of limitations in this section does not bar the proceedings as to that party; and amended complaint under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03 avoids the impact of the statute of limitations by letting the amendment relate back to the original filing, and therefore this section is inapplicable for the reason that no statutory bar to the amendment exists.

       Dismissal of health care liability complaint against a physician was appropriate because the physician was not served with process as required by the saving statute in that the patient did not continue the action against the physician by obtaining issuance of new process within one year from issuance of the previous process, or within one year of the filing of the complaint. Furthermore, the patient was not entitled to rely on the fraudulent concealment doctrine or the discovery rule to toll and extend the statute of limitations. Brookins v. Tabor, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn.

       An innocent mistake of the complainant, not superinduced by the defendant, as to the existence of an injunction in the defendant's prior suit against the complainant, is insufficient to enable a court of chancery to interfere with the defendant's legal right to rely upon the statute of limitations.

       Where the summons was delivered to the plaintiff's attorney, but was never delivered to an officer, and the plaintiff dismissed his suit for want of service of process, and thereafter, within 12 months, brought a new suit, this statute does not apply, because the first suit was never “commenced.” East Tennessee Coal Co. v.

       Circuit court properly upheld the constitutionality of the health care liability act and granted summary judgment to a doctor in a health care liability action by a patient and his wife (jointly, the patient) because, inter alia, there was no violation of the right to privacy since pursuing a health care liability action constituted a voluntary waiver, the patient failed to provide written notice of the suit within the limitations period and could not rely on the savings statute where the initial action was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations, and the disclosure of medical records was based on the patient's choice to sue the providers to whom the records would be given.

       It was error to dismiss a patient's refiled health care liability complaint as untimely because, when the patient gave pre-suit notices before filing each complaint, within one year of the voluntary dismissal, the patient was entitled to a 120-day extension of the saving statute, as (1) it could not be concluded that the general assembly required plaintiffs to provide pre-suit notice before refiling under the saving statute and yet deprived plaintiffs of the 120-day extension, and (2) the patient was not only entitled to the use of one extension, as the refiled complaint was a new and independent action.

      <p>
       Because the medical authorization sent by a conservator with the first notice letter was deficient, as it only permitted the recipient providers to send medical records to the conservator's counsel and not to other providers sent notice, the conservator did not receive a 120 day extension, which made the first complaint time-barred as it was filed beyond the statute of limitations. Although the conservator voluntarily dismissed and refiled the action, the second complaint was time-barred because of the untimeliness of the first complaint. Dortch v.

      <p>
       A new action for $10,000 in the circuit court for personal injuries, after a voluntary nonsuit before a justice of the peace (now general sessions court) two years after the injury, of the original suit in the justice's court, with the jurisdiction limited to $500, but brought within one year after the taking of the nonsuit, is not saved from the bar of the statute of limitations, by this section, except to the extent of the $500. Moran v. Weinberger, 149 Tenn. 537, 260 S.W. 966, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section in no way indicates that the plaintiff must take a voluntary nonsuit in general sessions court in order not to be bound by the court's jurisdictional limit. Therefore, the statute removes the jurisdictional limit from an action commenced in general sessions court, appealed to circuit court and subsequently recommended in circuit or chancery court. Morford v. Yong Kyun Cho, 732 S.W.2d 617, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2605 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case stemming from property damage, a trial court did not err by allowing a property owner to dismiss the lawsuit following an appeal by an adjacent landowner from a general sessions court judgment in favor of the property owner; a voluntary nonsuit was permitted at any time before the trial of a cause, and there was no authority holding that the party not filing an appeal from general sessions court was not allowed to nonsuit the action in circuit court. An argument that it was unfair to allow the owner to nonsuit the action and then potentially refile his claim in circuit court, seeking a larger amount of damages, because he did not appeal the general sessions judgment was rejected under the savings statute. Layman v. Acor, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 46 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 450 (Tenn. June 23, 2016).

       The common law courts of this state do not have jurisdiction, like courts of equity, to enter decrees dismissing actions “without prejudice” to the plaintiff's right to sue defendant again on the same cause or “with prejudice” to such right and the decisive test as to whether or not plaintiff can bring his action again is whether or not the dismissal is on the merits.

       Where the declaration avers not only an original cause of action, but the bringing of suit thereon within one year after its accrual, and that the same was dismissed without a trial upon the merits, within one year next before the present suit was instituted, a simple plea thereto “that the cause of action arose more than one year before the bringing of this suit,” presents no defense, for the unanswered averment of the declaration, which is admitted under the rules of pleading, constituted a sufficient answer to the plea.

       Where in an action for personal injuries the plaintiff alleged the bringing of a former suit and its dismissal by nonsuit and the bringing of the present suit within 12 months thereafter and the plea filed by defendant raising such issue simply alleged that “plaintiff's alleged cause of action, if any, accrued more than one year before the institution of this suit, and more than one year before the institution of original suit, and defendant here pleads and relies upon the one year statute of limitations as a complete bar,” the filing of such plea did not put upon the plaintiff the burden of making proof to sustain the averments of the declaration in this regard.

The district court properly concluded that the claims in the two complaints were not related closely enough to each other, and did not arise from the same set of operative facts, so as to give proper notice to the hospital regarding the nature of the complaints; as a result, the second complaint could not be deemed timely even through operation of Tennessee's savings statute.

       Tennessee's general savings statutes provide plaintiffs with additional time to refile a complaint after the dismissal of previous action. However, these general savings statutes are inapplicable to suits against the State of Tennessee or other governmental entities. Jackson v. City of Cleveland, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 606 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2016), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 948 (Tenn. Dec. 15, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee saving statute did not operate to save the lawsuit because the third refiling was filed outside the one year saving period and after the statute of limitations had expired and, because the saving statute itself barred the customer's third case, the trial court's focus on the improper service of process in the second case was unnecessary. Greenwood v. Nat'l Dentex Corp., — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 639 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent application of the savings statute, appellant's lawsuit would be time-barred, but his reliance on the savings statute was misplaced because application of the statute would run afoul of the doctrine of sovereign immunity; given Tennessee precedent holding that the savings statute did not apply to save claims against governmental entities, the savings statute was unavailable to allow the maintenance of appellant's lawsuit against appellee, and the trial court's dismissal of the complaint was justified. Clark v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 226 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2017).
      </p>

       Even assuming that the savings statute was somehow available, the trial court did not err in dismissing the case because at the time the trial court's order of dismissal was entered, over a year had elapsed from the filing of the complaint without any issuance of process.

      <p>
       Trial court properly dismissed a wife's claim for loss of consortium as barred by the statute of limitations because the wife she was not a party to the patient's original health care liability complaint that was dismissed without prejudice; thus, the wife was unable to take advantage of the saving statute that was available to the patient, her husband.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in dismissing a patient's health care liability company against a doctor because they were barred since the patient failed to comply with the saving statutes; the patient did not serve the doctor with process as required by the saving statute because the doctor was not served with the complaint before the trial court dismissed it for lack of prosecution.

       Dismissal of executrix's second health care liability action was appropriate because the executrix's original complaint was untimely filed as no reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that the executrix, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should not have known that the executrix was injured as a result of the health care provider's allegedly wrongful conduct when the executrix learned that the executrix's parent had escaped from a hospital and killed their spouse before committing suicide.

      </p>
      <p>
       Appellants commenced the first complaint within the statute of limitations applicable to their personal injury claim, a dismissal was entered without prejudice and not upon any ground concluding appellants'  right of action; therefore, the one-year statute of limitations under the savings statute commenced upon entry of the dismissal order and the second complaint was timely filed. The delay in filing the return of service did not bar application of the savings statute. Villalba v. McCown, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 424 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2019).

Abels v. Genie Indus., 202 S.W.3d 99, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legal disability statute gives the legal representatives of minor persons and those of unsound mind the right to commence an action after the removal of such disability; the statute is silent, however, as to the effect of a representative commencing an action before the disability is removed. Abels v. Genie Indus., 202 S.W.3d 99, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legal disability statute grants a period of grace for minors and those of unsound mind during their disability, and provides a maximum of three years in which to bring a claim after the disability is removed. Importantly, the statute does not treat the two disabilities differently but provides the same protections for individuals of unsound mind that it does for those under the age of eighteen. Abels v. Genie Indus., 202 S.W.3d 99, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plain language of Tennessee's legal disability statute tolls the running of the statute of limitations while the claimant is either under the age of eighteen years, or of unsound mind; the disability of unsound mind is removed when the individual is no longer of unsound mind, due either to a change in the individual's condition or the individual's death and the statute contains no language which would lead the supreme court of Tennessee to conclude that the legislature intended for removal of either of these two disabilities upon appointment of a guardian. Abels v. Genie Indus., 202 S.W.3d 99, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 836 (Tenn. 2006).

   Tolling statute, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-106" target="_self">28-1-106</a></cite>, is the more specific statute, and it controls over the more general provision of the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act.

   Intent of the language that “all acts done by an attorney in fact during any period of disability” shall bind the principal “as if the principal were competent and not disabled,” was to give the citizens of Tennessee the statutory authority to create a durable power of attorney; the statute does not refer to and was not intended to override the protections afforded to persons with disabilities under the tolling statute, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-106" target="_self">28-1-106</a></cite>.

   Court of appeals did not err in reversing the decision of the trial court that found that a deceased nursing home resident's negligence claims against the home were barred by the statute of limitations; the deceased was mentally incapacitated while he was a resident at the home, and therefore T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104ol1a1" target="_self">28-3-104(a)(1)</a></cite>, the statute of limitations on his negligence claims, remained tolled by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-106" target="_self">28-1-106</a></cite> until his disability was removed by his death, and the tolling was uninterrupted by the existence of a durable power of attorney in his representative.

       All minors have some person, either a guardian or a parent or a next friend, who has the authority to file a lawsuit on their behalf. It is the opinion of the supreme court of Tennessee; therefore, “the person entitled to commence an action” refers to the person who suffered the legal wrong or to whom the claim belongs. Sullivan v. Chattanooga Med. Investors, 221 S.W.3d 506, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 361 (Tenn. Apr. 24, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the supreme court of Tennessee were to construe the language in the tolling statute, “the person entitled to commence an action,” to include anyone with the authority to commence an action, the tolling statute would never apply in any case when a person is deemed to have the authority to act for someone who is disabled because of age or unsound mind; such a construction would conflict not only with the purpose of the statute but also with the supreme court's previous jurisprudence. Sullivan v. Chattanooga Med. Investors, 221 S.W.3d 506, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 361 (Tenn. Apr. 24, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Person “entitled to commence an action” was a deceased nursing home resident who was incompetent while residing there because it was the deceased who had suffered the alleged negligent treatment at the hands of the nursing home; the deceased's representative, who had a durable power of attorney, was not the person entitled to commence the action. Sullivan v. Chattanooga Med. Investors, 221 S.W.3d 506, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 361 (Tenn. Apr. 24, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Person “entitled to commence an action” is more than just a person who has the authority to bring an action; the term clearly refers to the person who is under the disability, who suffered the legal wrong, and to whom the claim belongs.

       If a minor can recover for prenatal injuries caused by negligence, a minor should be able to recover for prenatal injuries caused by the failure of a health care provider to obtain informed consent; there is no meaningful distinction between a minor who suffers injuries in utero from the negligence of a driver on the road and a minor who suffers injuries in utero from the failure of a physician to disclose all appropriate information to the minor's mother before performing a medical procedure.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a minor has an independent action for lack of informed consent for injuries that occur after birth, the minor should have an independent action for injuries that occur prior to birth, as it would be arbitrary to allow a minor to recover for injuries sustained ten minutes after delivery and to prohibit a minor to recover from injuries sustained ten minutes before delivery; the minor is unable to consent in either circumstance, and effective consent must be obtained from a parent or guardian.

   Appellate court erred by dismissing appellant's claims under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) on statute of limitations grounds because it was premature, as the decisions regarding the diocese's alleged fraudulent concealment of its knowledge of and responsibility for the priest's alleged sexual abuse of appellant and appellant's diligence in pursuing his claims against the diocese required further development of the facts through discovery. There was no dispute that appellant's 18th birthday occurred on August 18, 1978 and that in accordance with T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-106" target="_self">28-1-106</a></cite> he had one year from that date to file suit; there was also no dispute that appellant did not sue the church diocese until almost 29 years after the statute of limitations would have expired.

       Where the right of action accrues to a person capable of suing, the statute of limitations begins to run against it, and the running is not stopped by his death, the infancy of his representatives, and no grant of administration. When the statute has once begun to run, no disability subsequently arising will arrest its progress. Lawrence v. Thornhill, 1 Shan. 388 (1875); Anderson v. Anderson, 2 Shan. 437 (1877).

       Where the creditor's right to sue does not accrue from more than six months after the grant of administration upon his deceased debtor's estate, his right of action will be barred, unless suit is instituted within 18 months after the accrual of his right to sue.

       The statute of limitations of six years does not run against the creditors of a decedent, either during the six months immediately after the administration is granted, or during the period, not exceeding six months, actually elapsing between the decedent's death and the granting of administration on his estate.

       The periods within which creditors must bring suit against personal representatives do not begin to run until six months after their qualification, during which time they are exempt from suit, or from accrual of cause of action, if that occurs after the expiration of the six months, and this rule applies to insolvent estates as well as solvent ones.

       When a decedent died the survival statute paused the statute of limitations, and because no personal representative was appointed during the six month period following his death, the statute of limitations recommenced; because the statute of limitations period ran before a driver and her husband filed their action against the administrator ad litem, the statute of limitations barred their personal injury claims, and the administrator's motion to dismiss was properly granted.

       Where defendant worked in adjoining state during war, but maintained residence within this state, returning to his home over weekends, he was not absent from the state so as to prevent statute of limitations from running against rights of creditor.

   Although defendant considered himself resident of state where he was absent from state most of the time between time of accident and filing of suit, and the total time he was in the state during that period did not amount to one year, this section was applicable, especially since at that time only personal service could be had, substituted service not being permitted under §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.20.html#t20c02s20-2-203" target="_blank">20-2-203</a></cite> for residents temporarily absent until after the 1957 amendment.

       Where a cause of action accrues against a person then absent or out of the state, the first part of this statute provides that the suit may be commenced within the time limited by our statutes of limitation, after the return of such person to this state. Taylor v. McGill, 74 Tenn. 294, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 251 (1880). See Mann v. Smith, 158 Tenn. 463, 14 S.W.2d 722, 1928 Tenn. LEXIS 176 (1929).

   A corporation is a person, within the purview of this statute, excluding the absence from the state in computing the time for the running of the statutes of limitation; but a foreign corporation is not “absent from,” and does not “reside out of,” the state, within the meaning of such statute, where it has, for the period requisite for the running of the statute, continuously operated its business within the state, maintaining an office, with officers and agents subject, under our statutes, to service of process that binds the corporation, and such corporation is entitled to plead and rely upon the defense of the statutes of limitation, to the same extent as a domestic corporation, although it may have failed to comply with the requirements of the law for the domestication of foreign corporations. Turcott v. Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. Co., 101 Tenn. 102, 45 S.W. 1067, 1898 Tenn. LEXIS 37, 70 Am. St. Rep. 661, <cite class="lra">40 L.R.A. 768</cite> (1898).

       Affidavit of corporation employee showing no more than that he solicited orders for the corporation was insufficient to show that nonresident corporation was subject to service in Tennessee through such employee. Young v. Hicks, 250 F.2d 80, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4452 (8th Cir. Mo. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that defendant's agent for service of process died before the one year period of limitation had expired would not toll the statute since § 48-910 (repealed) provides for service on secretary of state in such cases. Sigler v. Youngblood Truck Lines, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 61, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3823 (D. Tenn. 1957).

       Where plaintiff contended that statute of limitations had not run because of suspension under this section since defendant was a corporation not domesticated and not doing business in Tennessee, but was subject to suit in Tennessee because as of a certain date a certain corporation opened a Knoxville office handling defendant's products and thereby became an agent for the purpose of service of process, plaintiff could not contend that period of limitations had not run where it was shown that such agency agreement was actually entered into one and a half years earlier.

   Where the remedy of the suitor is unaffected by the absence of the defendant from the state and the nonresidence of the defendant does not affect the right to sue, the provisions of this section are without application. Arrowood v. McMinn County, 173 Tenn. 562, 121 S.W.2d 566, 1938 Tenn. LEXIS 43, <cite class="alr">119 A.L.R. 855</cite> (1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       The object of this section is to save the creditor's remedy while he is kept from enforcing it by his debtor being out of the state, but if the debtor's absence is not such as to prevent his creditor from suing him and having him personally served with process in the state, it is not an absence within this section, and does not suspend the running of the statute. Spiegel, Inc. v. Luster, 31 Tenn. App. 342, 215 S.W.2d 16, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 96 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1948).

   Worker's compensation recipient must bring action against nonresident third party tortfeasor in another state within one year after the injury or as a matter of law the cause of action is assigned to his employer, since this section does not toll the running of the time specified in § 50-914 (now §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.50.html#t50c06s50-6-112" target="_blank">50-6-112</a></cite>).

   Although a homeowner's association followed the correct procedure in its restrictive covenants to increase the amount of dues, an appellate court was unable to review the dismissal of a lot owner's counterclaims because the trial court did not make findings, as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04, concerning the ground for its application of laches or whether T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-114" target="_self">28-1-114</a></cite> “saved” the owner's counterclaims.

   In a case in which appellants filed suit to assert rights to a tract of real property by adverse possession, the trial court was correct in ordering appellants to vacate the disputed property because appellants'  petition was filed before they had adversely possessed the property for a total of seven years. Moreover, pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-114" target="_self">28-1-114</a></cite>, appellee's counterclaim for ejectment related back to the filing of appellants'  original petition.

   Seven years' adverse possession of granted land, by a person and those through whom he claims, under color or assurance of title, purporting to convey an estate in fee, without any intermediate existing estate and without any claim by action at law or in equity commenced within that time, extinguishes the equitable and legal title of the true owner and draws the same to the possessor's title, and invests him with a good and indefeasible title in fee, provided the true owner was under no legal disability or exception in the statute, and the possession was adverse to him.

       Where the state has issued three successive grants covering the same land, and the defendants, claiming under the third grant, have held the adverse possession of a part of the land covered by the three grants, for a period of seven years, under an assurance of title purporting to convey a fee, the statute took away the title of the real owner, the first grantee, and transferred it, in legal effect, to the adverse occupant, and thus clothed him with a perfect title, and the extinguishment of the title of the first grantee did not vitalize the second grant nor infuse title into the second grantee. Earnest v. Little River Land & Lumber Co., 109 Tenn. 427, 75 S.W. 1122, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1902).

       Legal title by adverse possession may be acquired by seven years adverse possession under a registered assurance of title where the land has been originally granted by the state, or by 20 years adverse holding, which amounts to an assurance of title.

       This section deals with land granted by the state and requires only seven years' adverse possession of the land under recorded assurance of title of such land to perfect legal title in the adverse holder to the extent of the boundaries set forth in the color of title under which the land is held, even though possession is located only on a part of the land included in the boundaries of the adverse holder's assurance of title. Moore v. Brannan, 42 Tenn. App. 542, 304 S.W.2d 660, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 97 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

      <p>
       When the requirements of this section are met, title is transferred by operation of the statute from the holder of the legal title to the adverse claimant. The statute takes the place of a formal conveyance of land such as a grant or deed. Moore v. Brannan, 42 Tenn. App. 542, 304 S.W.2d 660, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 97 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

       A suit by a person having a right-of-way to abate an adverse use must be brought within seven years from the time the cause of action arose or the right of action is barred; in the interim period of time between the seven years and 20 years, if the adverse holding ceases, the person who has the right-of-way may resume his use, as the right-of-way still exists, on the other hand, he may not bring an action to abate the adverse use during that period and if the adverse use continues for 20 years, the right-of-way is extinguished.

       This section has no application to an action which merely seeks to subject the land to the burden of a debt or charge imposed either by contract or by statute.

       This statute applies where there is an adverse holding of real estate, but it does not apply in an action to remove a cloud on title affecting the marketability of land, or under which an adverse possession might be attempted, and thus endanger the rights of the complainant, and a bill to remove cloud from title may be maintained, where the owner is in possession, or as some of the cases put it, where the owner is not out of possession.

       Possession of land for seven years under a void grant, as under a grant of lands within the Indian boundary prohibited from appropriation, will not avail in ejectment. Cocke's Lessee v.

       A deed of conveyance of land previously granted by the state, by whomsoever made and upon whatsoever consideration, is an assurance of title, though it forms no connection with the grant by a regular chain of conveyances from the state's grantee; and adverse possession under such deed for seven years will perfect the possessor's title. Hampton's Lessee v. M'Ginnis, 1 Tenn. 286, 1808 Tenn. LEXIS 15 (1808); Craddock v. Stalcup, 1 Tenn. 351, 1808 Tenn. LEXIS 50 (1808); Sawyer v. Shannon, 21 F. Cas. 579, 1 Tenn. 465, 1809 Tenn.

   A deed for granted lands is founded upon a grant, in the sense of the statute of limitations, though such deed be made without connection of the title with the grant. Gray v.

      <p>
       Where the state's grant includes within its boundaries, but excludes from its operation, all older and superior claims, it is not operative as color of title to land so included and excluded, and sufficiently identified and located within the grant, and shown to be covered by older and superior title, and a possession of part or all of such included and excluded land is not a possession under color of title.

      <p>
       The state's grant is of no force to transmit title to land where the state had previously granted the same, and has no interest left which it can grant or convey, and its second grant can only serve as an assurance of title to be made effective by seven years' adverse possession thereunder.

       It is the rule that the statute of limitations does not run until there is a valid grant of land from the sovereignty having title and jurisdiction for the obvious reason that until there is a grant the title is in the sovereign or state and the statute does not run against the sovereign.

   The State of North Carolina, after the Cession Act (Acts 1789, ch. 3), ceding to the United States the territory afterwards embraced in the State of Tennessee, had no power to issue grants for lands, within such ceded territory, except to perfect incipient rights or titles, in pursuance of the reservation made in the act.

       Inasmuch as the state of North Carolina once owned the territory now the state of Tennessee, and exercised its sovereignty by granting lands therein, the legislature intended in this section to recognize the grants of North Carolina, while sovereign in such territory, in the same way as the grants of Tennessee itself.

       From the reason and policy of the statute, as well as from the obvious import of the language employed, the possession shall be adverse, for it would be absurd to maintain that a permissive possession should be held to ripen into a title, or to bar the right of the legal owner.

   To constitute adverse possession, the possession must be accompanied with a claim of right to the property. It requires both the actual possession and an intent, fully developed by words or action, to claim the property against the true owner, in order to render the possession adverse. The possession must be adverse, whether it be asserted under §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-101" target="_self">28-2-101</a></cite> or §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-103" target="_self">28-2-103</a></cite>.

       A possession by permission of the owner, or in subordination of his title, is not an adverse possession. Story v. Saunders, 27 Tenn. 663, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1848); Memphis v. Lenore, 46 Tenn. 412, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1869).

       The statutes of limitation can confer title upon no one except the person in adverse possession, and, therefore, adverse possession by trustee under a void deed of trust may vest title in the trustee, but not in claimants as remainderman under such void deed, because no estate in remainder was vested in them for the reason that such deed was void. Stevens v. Bomar, 28 Tenn. 546, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 120 (1848); Watkins v. Specht, 47 Tenn. 585, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 177 (1870).

       The public cannot acquire a right-of-way by mere use which is permissive, and not adverse, and without any intention on the part of the owner of the land to dedicate the way to the public. Henderson v. Alloway, 3 Cooper's Tenn. Ch. 688 (1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The adverse possession must be of such open and notorious character that the owner may be reasonably presumed to have known of it. Kirkman v. Brown, 93 Tenn. 476, 27 S.W. 709, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1894); Sequatchie Valley Coal & Iron Co. v. Coppinger, 95 Tenn. 526, 32 S.W. 465, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 126 (1895).

       Adverse possession requires the presence of certain definite ingredients. The essential ones are, that the possession be open, notorious, continuous, exclusive, actual, and of course adverse. United States v. McCulley, 100 F. Supp. 379, 1951 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3942 (D. Tenn. 1951).

       To determine what is actual possession, reference must be had to the nature and situation of the property, the usage to which it is adapted, and the kind of possession of which it is susceptible.

       The owner of a water mill situated on a stream acquires, by occupation and operation of the mill, actual adverse possession, not only of the mill buildings and wheel pit, but of the bed of the stream to its thread, between such points above and below the mill as will afford the free and unobstructed use of the water in the operation of the mill; and if such possession be continued for seven years under an assurance of title, with claim of ownership, the title will be perfected, and if such possession, without assurance of title, be continued for seven years, such mill owner would acquire a defensive title to the extent of the above defined adverse possession. Cooper v. Great Falls Cotton Mills Co., 94 Tenn. 588, 30 S.W. 353, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 72 (1895); Green v. Cumberland Coal & Coke Co., 110 Tenn. 35, 72 S.W. 459, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1903).

       Possession is a fact composed of act and intention, but what constitutes possession in a given instance is sometimes difficult to determine, owing to the existence of qualifying circumstances. A house occupied or kept locked, or a fenced field with the inclosures maintained, constitutes possession, but the act of a casual trespasser does not constitute possession. Round Mountain Lumber & Coal Co. v. Bass, 136 Tenn. 687, 191 S.W. 341, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 171 (1916).

       Maintenance of a cowpen on a small portion of land, which is used to salt animals, is not sufficient basis for claim of actual possession. Sage v. Dayton Coal & Iron Co., 148 Tenn. 1, 251 S.W. 780, 1922 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual possession usually requires inclosure. It requires more than a casual use, more than the erection of a shelter or a stockpen for casual use, and more than a spot of cultivation within an unfenced wilderness of several thousand acres. The possession must be comparable to the susceptible uses to which a person of the claimant's character and occupation would normally make of the land. United States v. McCulley, 100 F. Supp. 379, 1951 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3942 (D. Tenn. 1951).

       Adverse holding is necessary to make the statute effective in barring the owner out of possession; and the bar was not intended to be applicable to cases where there was no adverse claim against the party entitled to the land. Graham's Heirs v. Nelson, 24 Tenn. 605, 1845 Tenn. LEXIS 145 (1845); Lincoln v. Purcell, 39 Tenn. 143, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 267 (1858); Martin v. Niblett, 86 Tenn. 383, 7 S.W. 123, 1887 Tenn.

       One holding for another, such as a tenant for his landlord, or a tenant in common for his cotenants, cannot hold adversely to such other while that relation exists. But he may throw off that relation, may work an ouster of his landlord or his cotenants; and upon such an ouster this section begins to run. Hood v. Cravens, 31 Tenn.

       Where a tenant makes a deed purporting to convey the land to another, or where a tenant in common makes a deed purporting to convey the entire estate in the land, this amounts to an actual ouster and disseizin which the landlord or the cotenant is bound to notice.

       Where the owner of a tract of granted land sold and conveyed the westerly half thereof by specific metes and bounds and retained the easterly half; and thereafter the entire original tract was assessed and sold for taxes, as one body of land and as the land of the original grantee who had, 45 years prior thereto, parted with his title by a conveyance of the land; and the tax deed, covering and conveying the land as one tract or body, was made to the purchaser under the tax sale, who took actual possession within the boundaries of the easterly half, and held the same adversely for more than seven years, but did not take any actual possession of the westerly half until a short time before the ejectment suit of the owner thereof was brought against such tax purchaser, it was held that such possession of the easterly half did not create a constructive possession of the westerly half, so as to displace the true owner's constructive possession, and to create the bar of the statute against such owner thereof, who had never been in actual, but only in constructive possession. The tax assessment, proceeding, and sale must have been treated as void, and as communicating no title to the purchaser thereunder, though it is not so stated in the opinion. Stewart v.

       There can be no constructive adverse possession which is not based upon a claim under an assurance or color of title, purporting to convey an estate in fee, and a possession outside of the boundaries recited in a deed is not under such assurance of title, because the possession without some written instrument defining the land is only notice to the boundaries actually inclosed or possessed, and, being limited in effect to the actual possession, cannot be invoked by the possessor as constructive adverse possession of land within the deed. Slatton v. Tennessee C., I. & R. Co., 109 Tenn. 415, 75 S.W. 926, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 85 (1902).

      <p>
       Seven years' actual adverse possession of the whole or some part of a tract of land previously granted by the state, when held under an assurance of title, purporting to convey an estate in fee, vests the possessor with a perfect and indefeasible title in fee to the limits of the boundaries described in his assurance of title. Earnest v. Little River Land & Lumber Co., 109 Tenn. 427, 75 S.W. 1122, 1902 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1902); Kittel v. Steger, 121 Tenn. 400, 117 S.W. 500, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1909).

      <p>
       The actual adverse possession of a part of a tract of land, under an assurance of title, constructively extends to the boundaries thereof, and if such adverse possession be within the superior title, its continuance for seven years perfects the title of the adverse possessor to the extent of his boundaries. The fact that there is a small tract of inferior title covered by a deed within the superior title on which there is no possession is immaterial, since the only title necessary to be affected or barred by the adverse possession is the superior title, and when that is barred, all is barred.

       An inclosure or residence on land is not necessary for the purpose of constituting actual adverse possession, but only such use and occupation of the land, under claim of ownership, as it is susceptible of, considering its nature and character, is necessary for that purpose. Cutting timber and digging ore will constitute actual possession under some circumstances. West v. Lanier, 28 Tenn. 762, 1849 Tenn. LEXIS 123 (1849); Creech v. Jones, 37 Tenn. 631, 1858 Tenn.

       The possession of a spring or ford for the ordinary purposes of use by one's family and hands, under claim of ownership, may constitute actual adverse possession as much as if they had been inclosed, for a spring or ford is often susceptible of no other possession than that of ordinary use and enjoyment.

       Where rights of defendants in ejectment turned upon actual inclosure, there was no error in charging the jury that if the possession was disturbed by an army burning the fences, such would not arrest the running of the statute, if it be shown that defendants resumed actual possession as soon thereafter as they reasonably could do. Temporary destruction of the fences by an army or by an accidental fire would not arrest the operation of limitations, if the fences be replaced within a reasonable time. McColgan v.

       Successive possessions, to be connected so as to make out a perfect and complete title, must be held under a deed or some assurance of title purporting to convey the fee; but a possession under a title bond for part of the time and under a deed for part will not be sufficient to make out a title, because the title bond does not purport to convey the estate; but so long as the possession is retained in such case, it is a perfect defense to any possessory action, provided it has been held for seven years.

       Adverse possession of land by members of the family of the possessor, or by his tenants, or by the occupation and cultivation of the land, is as operative under this section as a possession by actual residence, in person, upon the premises.

      </p>
      <p>
       The adverse possession may be held by a tenant for the landlord, without the tenant's knowledge of the adverse holding, for the tenant's possession is, in law, the landlord's possession, and its character depends upon the acts or intentions of the landlord, and not upon those of the tenant, and his declarations in reference to the same are immaterial.

       The possession of successive tenants under a landlord, claiming title by entry only, can be connected so as to create a bar to the better title, because a possession under an entry for seven years will confer a fee simple title. Sims v. Eastland, 40 Tenn. 368, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1859).

The defendant's possession did not ripen into adverse title, where his possession did not continue for the statutory period, excluding the time while the complainant was so in possession, for the time of such concurrent possession must be deducted from the defendant's time of possession. Sequatchie & S. P. Coal & Iron Co. v. Tennessee C. I. & R. Co., 131 Tenn. 221, 174 S.W. 1122, 1914 Tenn. LEXIS 101 (1915); Jones v. Coal Creek Min. & Mfg. Co., 133 Tenn. 183, 180 S.W. 991, 1915 Tenn.

       In a contest between the true owner and a trespasser under color of title, both holding actual adverse possession of different parts, at the same time, the constructive possession as to that part of the land outside the actual possessions is that of the true owner; and the fact that such trespasser was first in such actual possession can make no difference. Jones v. Coal Creek Min. & Mfg. Co., 133 Tenn. 183, 180 S.W. 991, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1915).

       Where two persons are in possession, and both claim title, the possession is neutralized; and the fact that one title may be equitable and the other legal, or that one may be in deed and the other in parol, as resulting trust, can make no difference.

       Seven years' adverse possession by mere trespasser is not sufficient to bar action by owner, since defendant must claim peaceably under a color of title. Patton's Lessee v. Hynes, F. Cas. No. 10835, 18 F. Cas. 1338, 3 Tenn. 356, 1 Cooke 356, 1813 Tenn. LEXIS 32 (1813).

       <p>
   Adverse possession of seven years is a bar only when held under a grant or a deed founded on a grant. Den ex dem. Walker v.

      <p>
       Registration formerly was not, but now is, necessary for the creation of a good defensive or possessory title by adverse possession. Jones' Heirs v. Perry, 18 Tenn. 59, 1836 Tenn. LEXIS 102 (1836); Meriwether v. Vaulx, 37 Tenn. 300, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 4 (1858); Nelson v. Trigg, 72 Tenn. 701, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 79 (1880); Kittel v. Steger, 121 Tenn. 400, 117 S.W. 500, 1908 Tenn.

      <p>
       Where predecessor held under no color of title and no claim of title could be perfected under his holding, without such color defining his boundaries, his possession was merely a defensive right which was lost by the abandonment of the possession after his death. Schmittow v. McFall, 39 S.W. 886, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 98 (1896).
      </p>

       By the terms of this section, the adverse possession under the state's grant is not effective in perfecting the title, unless such grant is registered. Smith v. Cross, 125 Tenn. 159, 140 S.W. 1060, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1911).

       Case was not made out under this section because deed had not been registered for seven years. Jones v. Mosley, 29 Tenn. App. 559, 198 S.W.2d 652, 1946 Tenn. App. LEXIS 91 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1946).

       An assurance of title purporting to convey an estate in fee, though not, in fact, conveying such estate, constitutes color of title; and it may be a fraudulent or forged deed, or it may be a will, or a decree divesting and vesting title, or any other paper purporting to transfer a title in fee.

       The decree of the chancery court and the will of the deceased purported to convey only the right, title and interest of the deceased.

       It may be that the assurance of title of the adverse possessor is void for the reason that his grantor had no title to convey.

       The deed of an executor, showing on its face that it was made in pursuance of a power conferred by the will, and purporting to convey “all the right, title, and claim” of the testator who held under registered tax deeds purporting to convey an estate in fee, is an assurance of title vesting title in one who has had seven years' adverse possession of land under an assurance of title.

      </p>
      <p>
       One who makes a deed conveying all his right, title, estate, and interest in certain described lands, or who uses equivalent words, necessarily refers to his title papers, and the deed conveys whatever interest those title papers show that he has; and where his title papers do not convey a title to him, in fact and law, but only purport to do so, the effect will be the same, that is, the deed would carry whatever force or effect such assurance has under our statutes of limitation.

      <p>
       While it may be that a deed purporting to convey all the right, title, and interest of the grantor in a specified tract of land, nothing else appearing, would not be an assurance of title, yet, when such deed is accompanied by proof of deeds purporting to convey an estate in fee to him, it and the grantor's title papers constitute color of title.

       A deed reciting that the grantors do hereby “absolutely give, grant, remise, release, and forever quitclaim unto the grantee” named “all such right and title as … the grantors have, or ought to have, in and to the” land described, is not a quitclaim deed; but, under the provision that every grant shall pass all the estate of the grantor, it conveys the grantors' whole estate in the premises, and refers to and must be taken in connection with the chain of title on which it is based, whereby it must appear what was the estate owned by the grantors, and was conveyed by them. Such deed purports to “convey,” since the word “grant” is equivalent to the word “convey.” Such deed is an assurance of title. Hitt v. Caney Fork Gulf Coal Co., 124 Tenn. 334, 139 S.W. 693, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 58 (1911).

       A tax deed which does not on its face identify the land conveyed thereby as a particular grant, but calls for the corners of another grant from which, under the evidence, it is apparent that the description in the tax deed was intended to cover the first grant, is sufficient to give color of title to that grant.

       A deed must contain some definite description which will identify the lands claimed thereunder, in order to be an assurance of title under this statute, and if the description is indefinite so as to make it impossible from the deed to locate the land, the conveyance and holding thereunder is void as a basis for the constructive possession.

Woodruff v. Roysden, 105 Tenn. 491, 58 S.W. 1066, 1900 Tenn. LEXIS 96, 80 Am. St. Rep. 905 (1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of limitations would not begin to run against a tenant in common until there was a clear and definite action of ouster by another tenant in common, and as this did not occur more than seven years prior to the commencement of the action a plea of the statute of limitations was not available as a defense. Woods v. Richardson, 190 Tenn. 662, 231 S.W.2d 340, 1950 Tenn. LEXIS 590 (1950).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The possession of land by one tenant in common is presumed to be for all the tenants owning the same, for every presumption is that the possession is in subordination to the title of the true owners. Hubbard v. Wood's Lessee, 33 Tenn. 279, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1853); Elliott v. Holder, 40 Tenn. 698, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 205 (1859); Heirs of Marr v. Gilliam, 41 Tenn. 488, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1860).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes of limitation must receive a strict construction in favor of the cotenant not in actual possession, as the presumption is against an adverse possession between privies. The possession of one cotenant is consistent with the right of the other, and in support of their common title. Hubbard v. Wood's Lessee, 33 Tenn. 279, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1853); Heirs of Marr v. Gilliam, 41 Tenn. 488, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 96 (1860); Drewery v. Nelms, 132 Tenn. 254, 177 S.W. 946, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       To remove the presumption that one tenant in common in possession of the land is holding for all, the fact must be affirmatively proved, by clear and convincing evidence, not merely that he held the possession for himself, and adversely to his cotenants, for seven years, but that his cotenants had full knowledge of such adverse claim and holding, during all that period of time. Elliott v. Holder, 40 Tenn. 698, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 205 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       To overturn the presumed entirety of possession of one tenant in common, there must be some plain demonstration that he has repudiated the rights of his cotenants, and his adverse possession must, by some act or conduct of his, produce an actual ouster of his cotenants. Drewery v. Nelms, 132 Tenn. 254, 177 S.W. 946, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       While we adhere to the accepted rule that a tenant in possession is presumed to be holding for all other cotenants, as well as for himself, this presumption should not be indulged where the person in possession is a stranger to the instrument which created the alleged tenancy in common. Wallace v. McPherson, 187 Tenn. 333, 214 S.W.2d 50, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession by one tenant in common is also possession by other tenants in common and statute will not begin to run against them until he disseizes them by actual ouster or such an act as would give them actual notice that he was holding adverse to them. Eckhardt v. Eckhardt, 43 Tenn. App. 1, 305 S.W.2d 346, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).

       <p>
   One tenant in common may oust his cotenant, and hold as severalty; but a silent possession, accompanied with no act amounting to an ouster, or the giving of notice to his cotenant that his possession is adverse, cannot be construed into an adverse possession. M'Clung v. Ross, <cite class="us_code">18 U.S. 116</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">5 L. Ed. 46</cite>, 1820 U.S. LEXIS 246 (1820).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though tenants in common are not within any exception of the statutes of limitation, they will not be barred by the possession of a cotenant, except where his possession is exclusive and operates as a disseizin and actual ouster of the other tenants. Story v. Saunders, 27 Tenn. 663, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1848).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere silent and sole occupation by one of the entire property, though he claims the whole estate and appropriates the whole rents, without notice to his cotenants that his possession is adverse, where unaccompanied by some act which can amount to an exclusion and ouster of the other cotenants, cannot be construed into an adverse possession. Drewery v. Nelms, 132 Tenn. 254, 177 S.W. 946, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband and wife owned land as tenants in common, after the death of the husband the wife owned the fee in one half of the property, the other half descended to the husband's heirs, and the wife held possession not only for herself but for the heirs, and hence did not hold adversely to them. The fact that she collected the rent and paid the taxes was not an actual ouster of the heirs. Wallace v. McPherson, 187 Tenn. 333, 214 S.W.2d 50, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a will for probate, the acceptance, by a stranger to the instrument creating a tenancy in common, of a devise purporting to pass the whole property in question, taking possession, payment of the inheritance tax on the value of the whole property, collection of rents and making of valuable improvements, and the contest of the will, coupled with a failure by any of the cotenants to assert any interest in the property for more than seven years, constituted an ouster. Wallace v. McPherson, 187 Tenn. 333, 214 S.W.2d 50, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 278 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where tenant in common and his wife executed a warranty deed to property in question conveying such property to a third person who without taking possession reconveyed the property to such tenant in common and his wife for the purpose of creating an estate by the entireties in such tenant in common and his wife and where both deeds were duly registered, such conveyances and registration was not such notice to the other tenants in common of a hostile possession by such tenant in common and his wife to amount to an ouster or to cause the statute of limitations to run. Moore v. Cole, 200 Tenn. 43, 289 S.W.2d 695, 1956 Tenn. LEXIS 375 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Holding of land by one cotenant and taking the profits without accounting to the others was not sufficient proof of the ouster of the others. Eckhardt v. Eckhardt, 43 Tenn. App. 1, 305 S.W.2d 346, 1957 Tenn. App. LEXIS 100 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Will giving “all my property of every kind and description, real, personal and mixed,” without specifically describing any of it was not an assurance of title and was too general to be constructive notice to other cotenants that their interests were being devised.

       The exclusive adverse possession by one tenant in common, or his exclusive receipt of the rents and profits, without demand made by the other tenants or, if made, refused, and their title denied, would be evidence of an actual ouster or disseizin, and would vest title in such adverse possessor, if continued long enough. Hubbard v. Wood's Lessee, 33 Tenn. 279, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1853); Hilton v. Duncan, 41 Tenn. 313, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 69 (1860); Heirs of Marr v. Gilliam, 41 Tenn. 488, 1860 Tenn.

       The adverse possession by one tenant in common for the seven year period vests him with the absolute and indefeasible title to the whole tract. Hubbard v.

      <p>
       The open, exclusive, continuous, and adverse possession by a tenant in common, for seven years, under a parol partition, amounting to an actual ouster of the other cotenants, will vest the whole indefeasible title in the adverse possessor as against his cotenants. Fisher v. Loague, 3 Shan. 123 (1882); Morelock v. Bernard, 83 Tenn. 169, 1885 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       As between tenants in common, an ouster may be presumed in favor of one who, with the knowledge of his cotenants, and without objection, takes and holds, for many years, the adverse and exclusive possession of land owned in common, receives all the rents and profits thereof, conveys the land to secure his debts, and subsequently conveys it, in fee simple, to a purchaser who held adversely for many years before suit was brought. Burns v. Headrick, 85 Tenn. 102, 2 S.W. 259, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 17 (1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of land by one tenant in common operates against his cotenants where it is intended or understood by all the parties to be adverse, as where person in possession of land purchases an undivided interest in the land from an adverse claimant with a view to protect himself against litigation.

       Where the possession of a tenant in common was open and notorious, and, for the statutory period of seven years, he cultivated the land, removed practically all the merchantable timber, sold some 15 tracts off the land, the deeds being recorded, and never made nor was asked for an accounting, the possession was adverse, and the right of the other tenants was barred.

       The rule that a tenant cannot rightfully dispute the title of his landlord, without first restoring the possession, applies to a tenant who goes into possession under a parol lease for a longer term than one year, which is voidable under the statute of frauds.

       The possession of a tenant is the possession of his landlord, and is not adverse; but if the tenant disavow the title of the landlord, and hold for himself or another, with actual notice to the landlord or with his actual personal knowledge, such holding is an adverse possession, and if continued for seven years, with such knowledge of the landlord, the statute of limitations will form a bar; but the tenant can in no case contest the right of his landlord, or defend himself under a claim or title adverse to the landlord, during the prescriptive period.

       If the tenant disclaims his landlord's title, and holds adversely to it, with the knowledge of the landlord, the statute begins to run in his favor from that time, and will form a bar in seven years; but until the period prescribed expires, the landlord may recover in ejectment, the possession, by the mere force of the tenure, without any other evidence than the proof of the tenancy, for the tenant cannot set up the adverse claim against his landlord during the time the statute has to run.

      <p>
       Adverse possession of the surface of land by one holding under color of title, and who has, by his conveyance of the mineral interest, severed that interest from the surface, is not a possession of the severed mineral interest, nor does such possession inure to the owner of the mineral interest, for distinct estates were created by the severance.

       Where minerals are conveyed, the grantor, by implication of law, conveyed the right to obtain access to them through the surface, and as against that purpose he no longer held the surface adversely, because the grantor held it as trustee for the grantee, for the right of access was an incident to the conveyance of the mineral right, and became a part of that right when severed.

       Adverse possession for the requisite period of seven years, within the boundaries of a deed conveying and describing the land as a single tract, extended or made and held under such deed and after its execution, operates to perfect the title in the possessor to the entire tract, not covered by a counter possession on some part thereof, notwithstanding the land had been originally granted by the state to different persons and in several tracts, but, in case of conflicting titles, the possession must be on the disputed part; and the possession of one of several adjoining tracts conveyed by the same deed is not constructive possession of either of the other tracts, where the several tracts were separately described by the deed, and were not covered by one general boundary.

       In the case of conflicting land titles, the adverse possession must be the actual possession of some part of the land in dispute, or within the bounds of the disputed part, in order to make the statutes of limitation effective. Possession of some part of the true owner's land, not within the bounds of the disputed part, is not sufficient, because possession outside of the conflict or interference does not displace the constructive possession of the true owner, which the law attaches to him in virtue of his better title. Peck v. Houston, 73 Tenn. 227, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1880); Hebard v. Scott, 95 Tenn. 467, 32 S.W. 390, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 117 (1895); Elliott v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The adverse possession must be on some part of the disputed land, without any counter possession thereon, in order to nullify the constructive possession of the true owner as to the part not adversely held by actual possession. Kittel v. Steger, 121 Tenn. 400, 117 S.W. 500, 1908 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adverse possession under a younger grant on its interlap with an older grant perfects title under the younger grant; but adverse possession under a younger grant, when not within the interlap with the older grant, does not toll or affect the title of the older grant. Wright v. Hurst, 122 Tenn. 656, 127 S.W. 701, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1910).
      </p>

       Where the defendant's adverse possession bars the superior title of the complainant, though it be by actual possession of part constructively extending to the whole boundaries, the complainant is not entitled to recover that part of the land in the defendant's constructive possession, where there is a conflict between the grant under which complainant was holding and an inferior grant under which the defendant held another and additional deed, there being no title under such deed and grant within the interlap, for, when the superior title of the complainant was thus barred by actual possession of part constructively extending to the whole boundaries, all was barred. Jones v. Coal Creek Mining & Mfg. Co., 133 Tenn. 159, 180 S.W. 179, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that an adverse possessor under a tax deed as color of title, for more than seven years, acquired title to a small tract before abandoning the possession, the true owner, to defeat such title, must have had possession thereon during the adverse party's possession of the specific tract, and the true owner's possession of a number of other contiguous tracts which, with the one involved, had been embraced in boundaries inclosing one large tract, was not sufficient, for the general rule is that where there are several interlapping grants or conveyances, there must be actual possession on the interlap or disputed ground, in order to start adverse holding in respect thereto. Round Mountain Lumber & Coal Co. v. Bass, 136 Tenn. 687, 191 S.W. 341, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 171 (1916).

      <p>
       When A has superior title defining his boundaries to a grant of land, without actual possession thereon, and B enters under color of title to a smaller tract lying within A's grant and establishes actual possession thereon, B's possession to the extent of his boundaries is constructive to put into operation the running of the seven-year statute; and the subsequent location by A of an actual possession on his grant outside of B's tract, which is the disputed area, does not reconfer by construction the possession of A within B's boundaries, nor suspend the running of the statute. Conveyances by A of lands so possessed by B were champertous. Allis v. Hunt, 155 Tenn. 155, 294 S.W. 509, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       In case of conflict of title by reason of interlap, the possession must be located within the disputed area to be effective and to neutralize the possession of the other. Allis v. Hunt, 155 Tenn. 155, 294 S.W. 509, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 30 (1927).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Independent of the statutes of limitation, and upon common law principles and the general principle of public policy, a grant from the state will be presumed, where there has been a continued and uninterrupted adverse possession and enjoyment of land by actual occupation or enclosure under claim of ownership, for 20 years, though there be no paper title nor color of title, but the adverse possession must be the same character of possession as that required to perfect title under the statutes of limitation. Gwathney v. Stump, 2 Tenn. 308, 1814 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1814); Hanes v. Peck, 8 Tenn. 227, 8 Tenn. 228, 1827 Tenn. LEXIS 39 (1827); Cannon v. Phillips, 34 Tenn. 211, 1854 Tenn. LEXIS 35 (1854); White v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption is that the state's grant was issued to the last holder of the possession, where the 20 years' possession is made out by separate, successive, and consecutive adverse possessions, continued without break or hiatus, though there be no privity of title or occupation between them, and no transfers, verbal or written. Chilton v. Wilson's Heirs, 28 Tenn. 399, 1848 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1848); Scales v. Cockrill, 40 Tenn. 432, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1859); Heirs of Marr v. Gilliam, 41 Tenn. 488, 1860 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Grant from the state will not be presumed from actual adverse possession for 20 years, as to land included in the conflict of boundaries, but not included in the actual possession. White v. Lavender, 37 Tenn. 648, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 87 (1858); Snoddy v. Kreutch, 40 Tenn. 301, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of the state's grant from adverse possession for 20 years does not rest upon the probability of the fact, but upon the legal possibility thereof; and to destroy the foundation of such presumption, it must appear that the issuance of a grant, in the given case, was a legal impossibility. Williams v. Donell, 39 Tenn. 695, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 303 (1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual adverse possession of part of a tract of land, claimed under a deed or paper title describing the boundaries of the land conveyed, creates a constructive possession as to the part not actually possessed, and if such possession be held and continued for 20 years, without any counter possession, it raises a presumption of a grant from the state, not only as to the land actually occupied or inclosed, but also to the extent of the boundaries of such deed or paper title. Scales v. Cockrill, 40 Tenn. 432, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1859); Hunter v. Bills, 3 Shan. 97 (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a presumption of grant or deed whether the continuous possession be in one person, or there be several successive possessions; but the successive possessions must be connected without any hiatus, though there need be no privity of contract or other legal privity between the successive occupants.

       It must appear that the parties against whom the presumption of a grant or deed to land is sought to be enforced were, during the whole 20 years, in a position to resist the possession, that is, were not under disability; and, where the adverse possession was less than 20 years when the owner died leaving minor children, one of them, still a minor, is entitled to recover his inherited undivided interest in the land, because the presumption had not completely run as to him.

      </p>
      <p>
       The three years' saving for infants prescribed by our statutes of limitation has no bearing upon the presumption of title from the lapse of time; and where one was an infant at the time of inheriting land to which another claimed title by adverse possession, only the time during which the disability existed will be counted in determining the length of the adverse possession. Ferguson v. Prince, 136 Tenn. 543, 190 S.W. 548, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 160 (1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       To establish a right by prescription, the acts by which it is sought to establish it must operate against persons capable of making a grant, and in a condition to resist it. Davis v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 147 Tenn. 1, 244 S.W. 483, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is said in some cases that it is a part of the case of one claiming a prescriptive right to show affirmatively that the owners of the servient estate during the prescriptive period were competent to convey title, in the absence of any proof on the subject, it will be presumed that they were capable of suing or acquiescing in the prescription and the fact that they were not sui juris or capable of granting a right must be pleaded and proved.

       Where it is verbally agreed between tenants in common as the owners of land descended to them that all should give up their shares to one of their number, for a certain compensation, whereupon he entered into the exclusive possession, and held the land adversely for 20 years, the whole title was vested in such tenant.

       Where grantor was in possession of land, some of which he held adversely, and conveyed only the part to which he held good title, but gave possession of all, the court held no privity between grantor and grantee under the seven year statute, but that title could be perfected under the 20 year presumption since there was successive occupation. Ferguson v. Prince, 136 Tenn. 543, 190 S.W. 548, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 160 (1916).

       Where neither of parties had 20 years possession but together their period of adverse possession amounted to more than 20 years without interruption, the title and right to possession by prescription prevailed.

       <p>
   The operation of the statute in favor of one in actual possession under color of title can be suspended or stopped only by actual suit, or by the entry and actual possession of the true owner, made and taken before the bar is completed by adverse and peaceable possession for seven years. The peaceable possession cannot continue and exist, after the person having the better title takes actual possession in pursuance of his right. M'Clung v. Ross, <cite class="us_code">18 U.S. 116</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">5 L. Ed. 46</cite>, 1820 U.S. LEXIS 246 (1820).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only method by which the operation of the statute may be arrested or suspended is by suit in law or equity effectually prosecuted against the person or persons in possession, or by peaceable entry, in a legal sense, that is, an entry by the rightful owner with the consent and acquiescence of the adverse possessor. Norvell v. Gray's, 31 Tenn. 96, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 26 (1851); Wooldridge v. Planters' Bank, 33 Tenn. 297, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1853); Creech v. Jones, 37 Tenn. 631, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 82 (1858).

       The statute is not suspended by the abatement of an action of forcible entry and detainer upon the death of the ancestor. Jones v. Preston, 40 Tenn. 161, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 42 (1859); Hopkins' Heirs v. Calloway, 47 Tenn. 37, 1869 Tenn. LEXIS 6 (1869).

       Failure to assert a valid title does not amount to an abandonment or operate to extinguish such title. Marbury v. May, 9 F.2d 587, 1925 U.S. App. LEXIS 2433 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1925).

       It is true, as a general proposition, that a party cannot be divested of his title to land by a mere oral disclaimer. Boles v. Smith, 1 Shan. 149 (1859); Round Mountain Lumber & Coal Co. v. Bass, 136 Tenn. 687, 191 S.W. 341, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 171 (1916).

       Where land has been previously granted by the state to certain persons, seven years' adverse possession thereof by others under color of title will toll the true title, operating just as if a valid deed had been made, and the subsequent relinquishment or abandonment of possession cannot divest the title.

       Where it is established, a seven year adverse possession under a registered assurance of title purporting to convey the fee, vests a good and indefeasible title in fee to the land described in the assurance of title no less than if the true owner of the fee had conveyed it by deed, and such a title will support an action in ejectment or any other affirmative action, subject only to the qualification that it must appear that the land in question was granted by the state of Tennessee or the state of North Carolina.

       Actual possession under a deed raises no presumption that such possession began at the date of the deed. Stockley v. Cissna, 119 F. 812, 1902 U.S. App. LEXIS 4728 (6th Cir. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of adverse possession is to be taken strictly, and the adverse possession must be made out by clear and positive proof, and not by inference, for every presumption is in favor of a possession in subordination to the title of the true owner. Drewery v. Nelms, 132 Tenn. 254, 177 S.W. 946, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 18 (1915).
      </p>

       In an action of ejectment by the landlord against the tenant, before his adverse possession has formed a bar, the tenancy is all that need be proved. It is not necessary for the landlord to prove title, and the tenant cannot prove that his landlord has no title. Duke v. Harper, 14 Tenn. 279, 14 Tenn. 280, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1834).

      </p>
      <p>
       A deed conveying all that portion of a certain described tract of land not previously conveyed or held by older title, without description of the excluded land, operates prima facie to convey the whole described tract. It devolves on the defendant, who disputes the title of plaintiff claiming under a grant excluding older but not definitely described older titles, to show the existence of such. Southern Iron & Coal Co. v. Schwoon, 124 Tenn. 176, 135 S.W. 785, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (1911); Brier Hill Collieries v. Pile, 4 Tenn. App. 468, — S.W. —, 1926 Tenn. App. LEXIS 198 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the instruments under which an adverse claimant made his claim did not appear, but it was established that there was such a claim, another claimant, seeking in an action to establish title by adverse possession, had the burden of clearing up the question raised by the existence of the other claim, and of showing its invalidity. Jones v. Coal Creek Min. & Mfg. Co., 133 Tenn. 183, 180 S.W. 991, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       In spite of the principle that a tenant cannot attorn to another, so as to hold adversely to his landlord without notice to him, where it appeared that a tenant had claimed adversely to his landlord, a third party seeking to establish adverse possession to the same land, as against both the landlord and the tenant and their assignees, has the burden of showing positively that the tenant had no title by adverse possession, and of showing the absence of a lease inferred from the testimony of his own witness. Jones v. Coal Creek Min. & Mfg. Co., 133 Tenn. 183, 180 S.W. 991, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is incumbent upon the adverse possessor to establish, by clear and positive testimony, such adverse possession as will bar the real title. Jones v. Coal Creek Min. & Mfg. Co., 133 Tenn. 183, 180 S.W. 991, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 84 (1915); Davis v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 147 Tenn. 1, 244 S.W. 483, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 66 (1922); O'Brien v. Waggoner, 20 Tenn.

       Where a party bases his title or right upon adverse possession the burden is upon him to sustain such contention. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Sharp, 141 Tenn. 146, 207 S.W. 728, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1918); Blakemore v. Matthews, 154 Tenn. 334, 285 S.W. 567, 1926 Tenn. LEXIS 130 (1926); Hoge v. Southern Cities Power Co., 8 Tenn. App. 636, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 186 (1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule of law that one seeking to show title by adverse possession has the burden to make out by clear and positive testimony such adverse possession as will bar the title is applicable to the length of time as well as to the character of the possession. Southern Coal & I. Co. v. Schwoon, 145 Tenn. 191, 239 S.W. 398, 1921 Tenn. LEXIS 78 (1921).

      <p>
       That the statute of limitations protects a fraudulent vendee is clear under the authorities, and that the concealment of the cause of action by the vendor or principal will not prevent the running of the statute of limitations in favor of such fraudulent vendee is fully established. Akers v. Gillentine, 33 Tenn. App. 212, 231 S.W.2d 372, 1950 Tenn. App. LEXIS 102 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1950).

      <p>
       Fact that husband did not reveal to his children his execution of deeds to his wife to certain realty duly registered but never delivered did not amount to a fraudulent concealment of a cause of action so as to prevent the running of statute of limitations against claim of person claiming through the wife.

       Ejectment suit by heirs of original owner under grant filed over 80 years after tax deed issued under which defendants claimed was barred. Schooler v. Birge, 51 F. Supp. 610, 1943 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2221 (D. Tenn. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not contemplate adverse possession in the defendant, unless it be in a case where the taking and holding of possession gives a cause of action not otherwise existing. Where the defendant procured a land warrant to be issued to himself when it ought to have been issued to the complainant, and thus appropriated it to his own use, the complainant's right of action therefor then accrued, though the defendant did not take possession of the land, but subsequently procured a grant by virtue of the warrant. Dunlap v. Gibbs, 12 Tenn. 93, 12 Tenn. 94, 1833 Tenn. LEXIS 19 (1833); Neal v. President & Trustees of E. Tenn. College, 14 Tenn. 189, 1834 Tenn. LEXIS 62 (Tenn. Mar. 1834).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section has a broader scope than the preceding sections, in the fact that it creates a possessory right or defensive title to the extent of the boundaries of a title bond or other informal paper not conveying the title, but simply contracting to do so, or of unregistered deeds, where adverse possession has been held for seven years on some part of the tract described in such paper. Brown v. Johnson, 20 Tenn. 261, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 45 (1839); Rutherford v. Franklin, 31 Tenn. 321, 1851 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1851); Bon Air Coal Land & Lumber Co. v.

       Where defendant had entered into parol contract to sell farm back to complainant in consideration of cancelation of purchase money notes and promised to execute deed conveying same, but failed to do so, complainant did not perfect title to farm by seven years' adverse possession inasmuch as such possession without color of title only bars right of owner to recover possession and does not give the party holding adversely the right to have title decreed in him. Culwell v. Culwell, 23 Tenn. App. 389, 133 S.W.2d 1009, 1939 Tenn. App. LEXIS 48 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1939).

       Where a grantor mistakenly conveyed a portion of property by deed to an adjacent parcel, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Nashville, held that the grantor could assert adverse possession of that property, so long as he could prove that the possession was at least seven years in duration and was of such a character as to leave no doubt of claim of ownership by adverse possession and to give notice to the public of the possession and the claim, and that the trial court had erred in granting summary judgment on the issue to the grantee especially as there had been no hearing nor discovery as to whether the possession was adverse or exactly what portion of the property the grantor possessed.

       Court of Appeals of Tennessee, at Nashville, finds that the exception to the general rule, that a grantor was usually estopped by his deed from claiming that his holding was adverse, should be adopted in Tennessee as the more reasoned rule; i.e., a grantor who mistakenly conveys a portion of property by deed may assert adverse possession of that property, so long as he can prove that the possession was at least seven years in duration and must be of such a character as to leave no doubt of claim of ownership by adverse possession and to give notice to the public of the possession and the claim.

   Where defendants claimed title to certain land through a tax sale and tax deed dated May 23, 1856, and had altogether exercised such visible, open, exclusive, continuous domain and acts of ownership over the land, using it for the purposes for which it was adapted, for more than seven years, and more than 20 years before action was commenced, it was held that defendants had proven adverse possession of the land in controversy of the requisite character, under the recorded color of title and that defendants, under §§<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-101" target="_self">28-2-101</a></cite>,<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-105" target="_self">28-2-105</a></cite> had established title to the land by prescription; and, also, that under this section plaintiffs' action, if any they ever had, was barred by statute of limitations.

       A possession under an entry, although not an assurance of title, if sufficiently definite to point out the land intended to be appropriated, as a special entry does, will be protected under this section, and actual adverse possession of part will extend the constructive possession to the boundaries of such entry.

   Adverse possession of part of a tract of land, held under a special entry, though unsurveyed, extends to the boundaries thereof, provided the entry is sufficiently special to indicate clearly the land intended to be appropriated, and to enable the surveyor, from the face of the paper, to trace the lines with a compass, in accordance with its calls; and if such possession be continued for seven years, the possessor will be protected by the creation of a possessory right or defensive title, under this section, to the extent of the boundaries of such entry; but no absolute title is acquired by virtue of such entry and possession, under §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-101" target="_self">28-2-101</a></cite>, for the reason that a mere entry is no color or assurance of title purporting to convey an estate in fee. The fact that the possession is held for part of the time under the entry, and for part of the time under a grant, and by the enterer for part of the time, and by his conveyee for part of the time, after the issuance of the grant to the enterer, is immaterial.

   The accidental inclosure of a small part of the tract of land of another, by the extension of inclosures or by separate and independent inclosures, but not intended to be on the other's land, is not such adverse possession as will operate as constructive possession of the whole tract, nor to the extent of the possessor's boundaries under an inferior assurance of title, so as to perfect his title to the extent of his such boundaries; but such possession continued for seven years, under a mistaken belief of ownership, operates as adverse possession to the extent of the inclosures or actual possession, and creates in the possessor a defensive title to such possession. Gates v. Butler, 22 Tenn. 447, 1842 Tenn. LEXIS 121 (1842); Erck v. Church, 87 Tenn. 575, 11 S.W. 794, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 11, <cite class="lra">4 L.R.A. 641</cite> (1889); Williams v.

       A small extension of possession, made by a tenant under the direction of his landlord with the intention of establishing an adverse possession, was adverse, though the tenant knew nothing of the intention of his landlord. Waddle v. Stuart, 36 Tenn. 534, 1857 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1857).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The rule as to accidental inclosures operating as adverse possession is strictly limited to its facts, and is not to be applied when the fence or structure is not made by the possessory claimant but by the tenant of his adversary as a temporary one, without thought or intent of fixing a property line. Intent to be adverse is lacking. Buchanan v. Nixon, 163 Tenn. 364, 43 S.W.2d 380, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 124, <cite class="alr">80 A.L.R. 151</cite> (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule is that where a purchaser of land accidentally or by mistake incloses a contiguous strip, believing that he is placing the fence on the boundary, and holds the inclosed strip for seven years, his possession is adverse, and will avail against the true owner. Peoples v. Hagaman, 31 Tenn. App. 398, 215 S.W.2d 827, 1948 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1948); Liberto v. Steele, 188 Tenn. 529, 221 S.W.2d 701, 1949 Tenn. LEXIS 371 (1949); Frumin v.

       Adverse possession may be established by a person who possesses land between the actual property boundary and a fence upon another's land even though the person possesses the land by mistake and even though the fence was not erected with the purpose of marking the true property boundary.

   The inclosure of land is not necessary to establish adverse possession, where such inclosure would be impracticable, but adverse possession of such property may be established by such use and occupation as the land, from its situation, nature, and character, admits. Bensdorff v. Uihlein, 132 Tenn. 193, 177 S.W. 481, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 11, <cite class="alr">2 A.L.R. 1364</cite> (1915).

   Where the owner and keeper of a storehouse paved a triangular lot, used mainly as a means of access to the storehouse, first with brick and then with granolithic paving, and maintained such pavement for more than seven years, his possession thereof was sufficiently open and notorious to give him the possessory title. Bensdorff v. Uihlein, 132 Tenn. 193, 177 S.W. 481, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 11, <cite class="alr">2 A.L.R. 1364</cite> (1915).

       <p>
   A small triangular lot between two streets and a storehouse, which lot is principally valuable as a means of access to the storehouse, is not susceptible of inclosure, because such inclosure would destroy its chief value. Inclosure will not be required unless it is practicable, and the land is practically susceptible of inclosure, and “susceptible,” in that rule, is not synonymous with “possible.” Bensdorff v.

       No fatal gap between possessions was created by the conveyance of a lot to the defendants by their mother, where the parties believed that the strip of land in dispute was embraced in the lot when the deed was executed, the disputed strip was clearly appurtenant to the lot and necessary for its full use and enjoyment, and the parties were all members of the same household and continued to reside on the lot and to use the disputed strip in the same manner as before the deed was executed.

       Under subsection (a) of this section the courts have held that a defendant in adverse possession under any muniment of title, such as a parol sale or unrecorded deed, could hold to the extent of his boundaries set forth in his muniment of title against an attack by the holder of the legal title out of possession, even though the adverse possessor had actual possession to only part of the land covered by his muniment of title.

       A party in possession of land under a parol contract of purchase is not a trespasser. He has a colorable, descendible, alienable, and devisable title.

       A parol sale is only voidable and not void, and under this section seven years adverse possession by a parol vendee cuts off the right of the parol vendor to repudiate the sale and recover possession of the land but it is believed that it neither passes title upon which an ejectment suit can be maintained, or cuts off the right of the parol vendor to set up the statute of frauds as a defense to a suit by the parol vendee to compel specific performance of the parol sale by the execution to him of a deed.

       A parol gift of land coupled with an entry by the donee and adverse possession by him for more than seven years will vest him with a possessory or defensive right to the land, however such a donee has the burden of proving by evidence entirely satisfactory, not only the gift to show adverse claim but also his adverse possession.

       The constructive possession of land is dependent upon title; and, therefore, where a possessor, after acquiring a possessory right, abandons the possession, or the minor heirs of such deceased possessor abandon the possession, the constructive possession does not remain with him or his heirs, but reverts to the owner of the title.

       Abandonment of a possessory right, to bring about a loss of the right, must be shown by clear, unmistakable acts indicating a purpose to repudiate ownership. Phy v. Hatfield, 122 Tenn. 694, 126 S.W. 105, 1909 Tenn. LEXIS 41, 135 Am. St. Rep. 888 (1910).

       Trial court erred in ruling for a landowner in his action against an adjacent landowner to quiet title to a strip of land, which the parties'  referred to as the interlock, because the landowner's deed to the interlock was champertous and thus, void; the adjacent landowner's act of enclosing a portion of the interlock in a fence constituted actual possession of that portion of the interlock since the fence enclosed a portion of the interlock, it was open and obvious, and it gave notice to the world that the adjacent landowner claimed ownership of the property enclosed by the fence.

   Although a landowner was not the true owner of a strip of land because the landowner's deed to the interlock was champertous, that did not mean that an adjacent landowner was the true owner because the deed from a purchaser to the landowner was void and thus, the seller still possessed whatever interest it had in the property; if the seller was the true owner of the property, then it was an indispensable party to any action brought by the adjacent landowner pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-105" target="_self">28-2-105</a></cite> to establish that the adjacent landowner owned the property by adverse possession.

   Grantee stated a legally sufficient defense of adverse possession where she alleged that she and her predecessors in interest possessed the subject property adversely and exclusively in excess of seven years and had color of title through the succession of quitclaim deeds; T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-106" target="_self">28-2-106</a></cite> did not apply as the property was in the name of an adult trustee, and therefore was not considered to be laboring under a disability and the prescriptive period for purposes of adverse possession was not tolled.

       The mere fact of possession of the mortgagee under the mortgage deed will not bar the equity of redemption, unless it be continued so long as to afford a presumption of right. The mortgagee's possession, claiming against the right of redemption, to bar such right, must be continued the same length of time it would require to bar the debt by the mortgagor's possession, claiming against the debt.

       Only persons who had a vested interest in land at the time of the enactment of the statute barring actions to recover property or rents or profits therefrom are in a position to question the validity of the statute and claimant, who took by quitclaim more than three years later, is entirely too late to step into shoes of the delinquent taxpayer who was his predecessor and make the defense of lack of due process.

   Finding against plaintiff in her action against defendants involving a boundary dispute to 32 acres of land was appropriate, pursuant to T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-109" target="_self">28-2-109</a></cite> and T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-110" target="_self">28-2-110</a></cite>, where defendants and their predecessors paid property taxes on the disputed property for over 20 years and they also had recorded assurance of title. Defendants were entitled to a presumption of ownership under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-109" target="_self">28-2-109</a></cite> and plaintiff was barred from asserting a claim under T.C.A.<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-110" target="_self">28-2-110</a></cite>. Jack v. Dillehay, 194 S.W.3d 441, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 672 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), appeal denied, Jack v. Dilehay, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 378 (Tenn. 2006).

       Trial court did not err in holding that the exception to the statute applied and that adjacent owners established their claim of adverse possession of the disputed property because the tracts were contiguous, a relatively small area was at issue, and the adjacent owners paid their respective real estate taxes. Holtsclaw v. Johnson, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 782 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 28, 2015), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. LEXIS 21 (Tenn. Jan. 13, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court rightly denied a county's request for judgment on alternative bases because the county had already elected to obtain ownership of the subject property pursuant to the power of eminent domain, leaving only the issue of compensation to be decided. Therefore, the owners were barred from claiming title to the condemned property. Shelby Cnty. v. Crews, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 967 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 14, 2015).

       Where complainant and those through whom he claims have failed to have property assessed and to pay any state and county taxes thereon for a period of more than 20 years, he is barred from bringing any action to remove cloud on title. Lee v. Harrison, 196 Tenn. 603, 270 S.W.2d 173, 1954 Tenn. LEXIS 427 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not apply where it does not appear complainants failed to pay taxes for 20 years and where disputed property was alleged to be part of other property which they owned, even though the grantor of the defendants who dispute ownership paid some prior taxes on the disputed land. Winborn v. Alexander, 39 Tenn. App. 1, 279 S.W.2d 718, 1954 Tenn. App. LEXIS 155 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimants did not assert claim that deed was a mortgage for 34 years and did not pay taxes during such period, claim was barred. Van Dyke v. Inman, 50 Tenn. App. 493, 362 S.W.2d 795, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 158 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).

      <p>
       The failure to pay taxes for 20 years does not automatically cause a nonpayor to be ejected. Layne v. Baggenstoss, 640 S.W.2d 1, 1982 Tenn. App. LEXIS 383 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1982); Cooke v. Smith, 721 S.W.2d 251, 1986 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3583 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not bar a defense of title and since defendants filed a counteraction, plaintiffs' defense in the posture of a counter-defendant was not barred. The chancellor voided defendants' quit claim deeds on the basis that plaintiffs and their predecessors had adversely possessed the land more than 20 years at the time defendants received their deeds. Catlett v. Whaley, 731 S.W.2d 544, 1987 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2507 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987).

   In a property ownership dispute, the trial court misapplied T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-110ol1a" target="_self">28-2-110(a)</a></cite> and erred in granting summary judgment to a broadcasting company declaring that it owned an access road to its tower through adverse possession because, despite open use of the road, the company had conceded that neither it nor its predecessors in title had paid taxes on the disputed property for 20 years. Cumulus Broad., Inc. v. Shim, — S.W.3d —, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 790 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2005), rev'd, 226 S.W.3d 366, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 371 (Tenn. Apr. 27, 2007), overruled, Sweeney v. Koehler, — S.W.3d —, 2010 Tenn. App. LEXIS 762 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 7, 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Court of appeals erred in reversing the decision of the trial court and dismissing an adverse possession claim based upon T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-110" target="_self">28-2-110</a></cite> and holding that, because there was a failure on the part of the neighbor to pay real estate taxes on the land at issue owned by the property owner, the adverse possession claim failed. Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. v. Shim, 226 S.W.3d 366, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 371 (Tenn. Apr. 27, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of policy, possession of property for 20 or more years, accompanied by all other elements of the doctrine, is a basis for ownership. Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. v. Shim, 226 S.W.3d 366, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 371 (Tenn. Apr. 27, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because tax maps do not identify precise boundaries and actual boundaries are established by intent, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-110" target="_self">28-2-110</a></cite> should not serve as a bar to a claim of adverse possession when the tracts are contiguous, a relatively small area is at issue, and the adjacent owners making claims of ownership have paid their respective real estate taxes. Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. v. Shim, 226 S.W.3d 366, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 371 (Tenn. Apr. 27, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory bar to an adverse possession claim did not apply and that the two neighbors were mistaken as to the true boundary was of no consequence; the neighbor asserting the common law claim exercised exclusive, actual, adverse, continuous, and open and notorious possession, by the legal definitions of those terms, of the actual area making up the service road for more than 20 years and by all appearances, both parties paid taxes on their separate tracts throughout their intervals of ownership. Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. v. Shim, 226 S.W.3d 366, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 371 (Tenn. Apr. 27, 2007).

       <p>
   T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c02s28-2-110" target="_self">28-2-110</a></cite>, whether properly pled or not, was not a bar to the property action because the property taxes were paid by the previous property owner, a bank. Due to an error, the bank continued to pay the taxes on the property for 34 years after the property was sold. Milledgeville United Methodist Church v. Melton, 388 S.W.3d 280, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 638 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly held that this statute barred any affirmative action by plaintiffs to claim an interest in the disputed property and summarily dismissed the complaint because a rebuttable presumption of ownership arose as defendants had paid taxes on the property continuously for over 20 years; plaintiffs were not entitled to notice of the tax sale in 1994 as plaintiffs did not hold an ownership interest in the property at the time of the sale as there deed was not recorded until 1995; there was no proof in the record that the tax sale to defendants was invalid; and defendants'  predecessors in interest purchased the property at a tax sale in 1994, and their deed was duly recorded prior to plaintiffs'  deed. Kinder v. Bryant, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 286 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 22, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action between adjoining neighbors concerning the ownership of a strip of railroad property that was abandoned by the railroad in 1977, the court held that this section barred plaintiffs'  claim of adverse possession because it was undisputed that they did not pay taxes on the property for more than 20 years. No portion of the parties'  property overlapped the boundary of the other's tract, and the disputed property was separately assessed to the railroad for tax purposes at all times material to the issue and not to the parties. Butler v. Burrow, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 7, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly held that this action was barred as the evidence did not preponderate against the determination that appellants had not paid taxes on the disputed land; they paid taxes only on the 95.15 acres as it was plotted on the 1974 survey, and the surveys in the record made clear that the 95.15 acre tract did not include the gravel lane in question, and the property at issue was not contiguous to appellants'  property. Lee v. Smith, — S.W.3d —, 2020 Tenn. App. LEXIS 63 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2020).

      <p>
       Evidence to affect that tenants in common occupied premises for more than 20 years, paid taxes, made repairs, collected rent and appropriated same to themselves but gave no actual notice of an adverse claim was not sufficient to preponderate against trial court's judgment to effect that ouster as to other tenants in common had not been established and that adverse claim of exclusive ownership by prescription had not been shown. Memphis Housing Authority v. Mahoney, 50 Tenn. App. 117, 359 S.W.2d 851, 1962 Tenn. App. LEXIS 143 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1962).

   The posting of notices of a foreclosure sale is not a “suit brought” within the meaning of this section and does not fall within the saving clause of the statute. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

   Where notices of trust sale by trustee were posted before the debt secured by the trust deed was barred but not in time to make the sale before the bar of limitation was complete, purchaser under such sale obtained no title to land so purchased.

   Under this section, the limitation on the right to foreclose the mortgage lien does not begin to run until the maturity of all of the debt secured thereby, no optional right of acceleration having been exercised by the creditor. Lawman v. Barnett, 180 Tenn. 546, 177 S.W.2d 121, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 321, <cite class="alr">153 A.L.R. 772</cite> (1944).

       A stipulation in the instrument securing two notes maturing at different dates that if either should not be paid at maturity, then both should become due and the premises should be sold, is solely for the benefit of the mortgagee, so that the mortgagor cannot take advantage of it in computing limitations.

       The date of maturity of a demand note securing a deed of trust was the date of its execution; a suit to enforce the lien securing the indebtedness evidenced by the note was required to be brought within 10 years from the maturity of the debt.

       The acceptance of a deed reciting that the grantee assumes and agrees to pay a certain mortgage debt on the land conveyed, though already barred by this 10 year statute of limitations, and the grantee's insistence upon the enforcement of the beneficial provisions in such deed, are equivalent to renewal of the mortgage, which may be enforced any time within 10 years from the acceptance of such deed, though such grantee knew nothing of such recital at the time.

       Where holder of a mortgage discharges it of record within the 10 year period and contemporaneously takes and registers a renewal mortgage securing his unpaid debt, the renewal mortgage has priority over a vendor's lien which was subordinate to the original mortgage.

       Where the agreement to extend the time of payment bound the mortgagor maker to pay increased legal rate of interest on the debt secured for the new term, and contained the mortgagor's covenant that the mortgage should continue as security for the debt and remain in full force, this was a new and additional binding of the land and the lien, thus created and renewed, continued in force for 10 years from the new maturity date expressed therein.

   Company's reliance on the amended restrictive covenants in its answer did not constitute an action; the statute of limitations in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-109ol1a3" target="_self">28-3-109(a)(3)</a></cite> does not operate to bar the litigation of an issue introduced as a defense rather than a claim, and having determined that the statute of limitations applies only to actions, and no action challenging the amended restrictive covenants had been filed in this case, the statute was inapplicable. Haiser v. McClung, — S.W.3d —, 2018 Tenn. App. LEXIS 509 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2018).

        It is the cause of action, and not the form, that determines what statute of limitations is applicable. Callaway v. McMillian, 58 Tenn. 557, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 299 (1872), superseded by statute as stated in, Pioneer Bank v. Kelley, — S.W.2d —, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 599 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 21, 1994); Alvis v.

       <p>
        The only way in which the statute of limitation is available as a defense is when it is, at the proper time, specially pleaded. Carolina, C. & O. R. Co. v. Mumpower, 205 F. 872, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1505 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had knowledge of all facts, it is improper to allow him to amend his answer, after all proof is taken, so as to plead limitation. Towater v. Darby, 15 Tenn. App. 53, — S.W.2d —, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 73 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

       <p>
        Where parties intended that deed should be to husband, but, by mistake of draftsman, the name of wife was inserted as joint vendee, husband's right of action to correct the deed is barred by 10 year statute of limitations, and the accrual of the cause of action cannot be postponed to the discovery of the mistake, there being no statute expressly providing for any such postponement. Barnes v. Barnes, 157 Tenn. 332, 8 S.W.2d 481, 1928 Tenn. LEXIS 194 (1928).

        The general rule is that courts cannot add exceptions to those made by the legislature. Phillips v. Memphis Furniture Mfg. Co., 168 Tenn. 481, 79 S.W.2d 576, 1934 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1935).

       <p>
        Mere concealment by a purchaser of the value of land which the vendor has an opportunity to ascertain is not a fraudulent concealment preventing running of limitations, where no trust relationship exists between the parties. Woodfolk v. Marley, 39 S.W. 747, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 89 (1896), aff'd, 98 Tenn. 467, 40 S.W. 479, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 241 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no sufficient fraud established to stop the running of the statute of limitations, claim on implied contract to pay a reasonable value of commissary stock transferred at the time of signing a lease, was barred by the statute of limitations. Kimberly Coal Co. v. Douglas, 45 F.2d 25, 1930 U.S. App. LEXIS 3555 (6th Cir. Ky. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        <p>
   To prove fraudulent concealment for the purposes of tolling a statute of limitations, a party must show: (1) wrongful concealment of their actions by defendants; (2) failure of the plaintiff to discover the operative facts that are the basis of his cause of action within the limitations period; and (3) plaintiff's due diligence until discovery of the facts. Electric Power Bd. v. Monsanto Co., 879 F.2d 1368, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 10141 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1989), rehearing denied, — F.2d —, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 12611 (6th Cir.

        The provision in Acts 1715, ch. 48, § 9 providing that creditors of deceased must file their claims within seven years or be forever barred was not repealed by Acts 1789, ch. 23 as far as heirs of deceased are concerned. Smith v. Hickman's Heirs, 3 Tenn. 330, 1 Cooke 330, 1813 Tenn. LEXIS 25 (1813).

        If administrative representative advertises for claims as provided for by provisions of Acts 1789, ch. 23, and none of the exceptions apply a claim will be barred in two years, but if there is no advertisement a claim will be barred in seven years as provided by Acts 1715, ch. 48, § 9.

        Right of representative to issue deed for land pursuant to agreement of deceased as authorized by Acts 1794, ch. 5 is restricted to seven year period, since representative cannot act on claims after seven-year period by virtue of Acts 1715, ch. 48, § 9.

        This statute is founded upon considerations of public policy, which are strongly sustained in its discouragement of litigation under circumstances which, in many cases, preclude the attainment of truth and justice; in its suppression of frauds and perjuries in attempts to set up demands against the estates of deceased persons, when the means of exposing their falsity have perished; in the necessity that those who succeed to the rights and property of such deceased persons should be quieted in the enjoyment of their rights.

        A personal representative cannot, by a request for a delay or by the recognition of a claim, stop the running of this seven year statute, nor can he extend or prevent the limitation in favor of the heir, allowed under this section after the recovery of a judgment against the personal representative.

        The heirs cannot rely upon this statute as a bar after seven years to a bill filed to set up a lost deed by the person in possession of the land conveyed therein, for the statutes of limitation and the lapse of time have no application to a bill in chancery, in which the complainant is not seeking to recover anything, but only resisting the demand of the defendants which he (the complainant) has been constantly opposing, by some equity inherent in the right or covenant on which the demand is vested.

        The original statute, substantially reenacted in this section, was given what was called an “equitable construction,” by which the statute did not begin to run until the right to sue accrued, a construction based upon the ground that the legislature could never be held to intend that a person should be barred of his action before the right to sue had accrued. Caplinger v. Vaden, 24 Tenn. 629 (1843); Jones v. Whitworth, 94 Tenn. 602, 30 S.W. 736, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1895); Woods v. Woods, 99 Tenn. 50, 41 S.W. 345, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1897).

        The purchaser of property under a warranty of title, executed by the deceased, does not become a creditor of the deceased warrantor till the property warranted has been recovered by title paramount; and, in such case, the purchaser is not barred, though seven years may have elapsed since the death of the warrantor. The warrantee has no cause of action till the property is recovered, and he is entitled to the time given by the statute from the period when his cause of action accrued. Caplinger v. Vaden, 24 Tenn. 629 (1843).

       <p>
        The general rule is that the statute begins to run from the date of discovery of a mistake made by a draftsman of a deed in a suit to correct, or from the time when it might have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The record of such a deed does not import notice of the mistake. McSpadden v. Parkenson, 10 Tenn. App. 11, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 2 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

        Where plaintiffs, heirs of decedent, sued to reform a deed so as to give them title to the land, the action was one, in effect, to recover title to the land and the seven year statute of limitations applied.

        Where the maker of a note paid a part of the note before it was due and the maker and payee agreed that interest would be charged on the payment so made and credited against the balance of the note, the statutes of limitation did not run even though there had been no credits entered on the note according to the contract.

        The bequest of trust property, as his own, by the trustee is a conversion, and the possession of the executor or legatee under the bequest would not be subservient to, but in opposition to, the trust, and in hostility to the right of the owner of the trust property, and the statute would begin to run against the person having an immediate possessory right to the beneficial interest and enjoyment of the property.

        The statute of limitations is looked upon with favor as a statute of repose, as it cannot be said that the result is harsh or inequitable, for there was a period of one year within which suit could have been started. West v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 108 F. Supp. 276, 1952 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2250 (D. Tenn. 1952).

        In action by equal employment opportunity commission against employer where employer contended that action was barred by one year statute of limitations as provided by this section, court held that while general rule is that where no limitation is provided by federal law, the state law governs, an exception is made where the federal government or one of its agencies is plaintiff on the concept of sovereign immunity and federalism, particularly where practice complained of is contrary to public policy. EEOC v. Duff Bros., Inc., 364 F. Supp. 405, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11757 (E.D. Tenn. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section being a procedural bar to legal remedies and not an extinguisher or qualifier of a statutory cause of action does not apply to a diversity action for wrongful death as the law of the forum state governs.

        In determining whether the purpose of an action is to recover damages which are personal, to property, or on account of a breach of contract, the court must look to the complaint and ascertain the basis for which damages are sought. Harvest Corp. v. Ernst & Whinney, 610 S.W.2d 727, 1980 Tenn. App. LEXIS 417 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1980).

Const., art. XI, § 8 or equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. 14. Dobbins v. Terrazzo Machine &amp; Supply Co., 479 S.W.2d 806, 1972 Tenn. LEXIS 401 (Tenn. 1972).

        Where notice of a proposed zoning reclassification to allow a shooting range involved ten acres, but the adopted resolution stated ninety acres, the ordinance was void ab initio and the statute of limitations was no defense because: (1) The resolution qualified as a zoning amendment which required specific procedures; (2) The county legislative body had no jurisdiction to act on the proposed amendment since the alteration was so substantial that there should have been a resubmission of the proposed amendment to the planning commission; and (3) The record did not establish the requisite public or private reliance for an exception to the application of the void ab initio doctrine.

        Where, in a civil rights action, the court had the choice of applying this statute or the Georgia statute of limitations, it held that where a civil rights action arose in one state but was brought in another, a federal district court should apply statute of limitations of the state in which the action arose. Jones v. Bales, 58 F.R.D. 453, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12766 (D. Ga. 1972), aff'd, 480 F.2d 805, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11519 (5th Cir. Ga. 1973).

   Under Tennessee law a claim would be barred because Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations for personal injury cases, §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_self">28-3-104</a></cite>, is not tolled under §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c01s28-1-105" target="_self">28-1-105</a></cite> by the filing of the lawsuit in another state where there was no basis for personal jurisdiction.

   Rather than permitting application of the one year limitations period of subdivision (a)(3) of this section, <cite class="us_code">28 U.S.C. § 1658</cite> mandated application of the four year federal statute of limitations to employee's racial discrimination claim under <cite class="us_code">42 U.S.C. § 1981</cite>.

        The declaration alleged the bringing of a former suit and its dismissal by nonsuit and the bringing of the present suit within 12 months thereafter, defendant's plea of one year statute of limitations was insufficient to put upon the plaintiff the burden of making proof to sustain his averments in the declaration.

        To determine whether suit is for tort or contract and therefore whether respective one or six year statute of limitations applies, court must look to plaintiff's declaration to see whether personal injuries are claimed regardless of how the action is styled and even though some contract damages are claimed. Bland v. Smith, 197 Tenn. 683, 277 S.W.2d 377, 1955 Tenn. LEXIS 335, 49 A.L.R.2d 1212 (1955).

        A federal action is commenced as against additional party defendants named in an amended complaint as of the date of the filing of the amended complaint, rather than the date of the order granting leave to so amend.

       <p>
        Notice to a liability insurer provided the sole basis for Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) notice to a new defendant, alleged tortfeasor, so that the plaintiff's amendment related back to the date of the original complaint. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).

       <p>
        Where shortly after an accident, the liability insurer of a defendant brought in by amendment became aware of the claim, and it received an “information copy” of the complaint with letter from plaintiff's counsel, based on the prolonged correspondence between plaintiff's counsel and defendant's liability insurer, including settlement requests, injury/medical updates and finally a copy of the complaint, the defendant received sufficient notice of the action that it would not be prejudiced in the maintenance of its defense. Smith v. TW Services, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 144, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20693 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).

        Plaintiff could not amend his complaint to identify John and Jane Doe officers because amendment would be futile, as his 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 excessive force and unreasonable seizure claims and his state law negligence, false imprisonment, and assault claims would not relate back to the date of the original complaint and thus, would be barred by Tennessee's one year period of limitations.

        Amended declaration in death action based on law of foreign state did not change cause of action merely because amended complaint cited particular foreign statutes upon which plaintiff relied to sustain cause of action which original declaration did not cite.

        In action for wrongful death, an amendment to the declaration setting up doctor's bill and funeral expenses as items of damages, was not demurrable as barred by limitation, since they were but items incidental to the wrong already and seasonably pleaded.

        Original complaint which alleged that plaintiff's injuries were due to the negligence of defendant's employees in the use of a scaffold, stated no different cause of action as respects limitation than amended complaint filed more than one year after date of injury which stated that her injuries were due to the negligent manner in which the scaffold was constructed, because the two acts alleged were but different invasions of plaintiff's primary right and different breaches of the same duty, thus amended complaint did not introduce a new cause of action so as to be barred by this section.

   Where the declaration in the widow's action for the wrongful death of her husband contains a count for common law negligence as against a railroad operating between two points in Tennessee, and another count for negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act as against a railroad engaged in interstate commerce, and amendment to the declaration allowing the widow to prosecute the suit in her capacity as the personal representative of her deceased husband, as well as in her individual capacity, does not introduce a new cause of action so as to be barred by the limitation of two years under the federal statute.

        The cause of action for a personal injury accrues at the time of the injury, and is the same whether brought by the party injured or by his personal representative. The statute begins to run from the moment of the injury, and is not suspended by the death of the injured party, nor during the time that intervenes after his death and before the qualification of his personal representative.

        Under the discovery rule, the determination of when the statute of limitations begins to run requires a determination of when the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge that she had sustained an injury.

        Statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff is aware of the facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct, and the plaintiff knows the identity of the person who engaged in the conduct.

        Class action tolling doctrine was consistent with Tennessee law and the trial court erred in failing to invoke same as to the replacement workers'  individual claims of breach of contract and interference with contract; the doctrine of laches did not prevent the replacement workers from maintaining their claims, in part, because they were not sleeping on their rights when they trusted the former class action plaintiffs to adequately represent their interests.

        Insureds did not comply with the rule because they failed to have any summons issued within one-year of filing the complaint; therefore, the insureds did not strictly comply with the rule and allowed their claim to lapse because the filing of their complaint was insufficient to toll the statute of limitations, and their claim against a driver was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

        Failure of a driver and her husband to comply with the survival statute by appropriately commencing their personal injury case until after the expiration of the statute of limitations barred their recovery because no new cause of action arose on the date they discovered the decedent's death that extended the statutory period for filing their claim simply on the ground that they failed to realize the decedent died until that date.

        Trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss filed by an administrator ad litem because a driver and her husband did not commence their lawsuit within the time afforded by the one-year statute of limitations; the discovery rule was not applicable to delay the commencement of the statute of limitations until the date when the driver and husband determined the decedent passed away because they were aware of the nature and cause of the driver's injuries on the date of the accident.

        When a decedent died the survival statute paused the statute of limitations, and because no personal representative was appointed during the six month period following his death, the statute of limitations recommenced; because the statute of limitations period ran before a driver and her husband filed their action against the administrator ad litem, the statute of limitations barred their personal injury claims.

        The statute of limitations does not run against married women during the disability of coverture, but this does not disqualify her from suing to recover damages for personal injury before the removal of the disqualification if she joins her husband as a nominal plaintiff.

   As the statutes saving the right of recovery for the personal injuries of a decedent to his widow, children, next of kin, and personal representatives, do not create a new and independent cause of action for them, but merely preserve the right that accrued to the decedent for their benefit, the statute of limitations that began to run against the decedent continues to run against those who succeed to his rights, notwithstanding their disabilities, and bars the action, unless it is brought within one year after the injury was done.

        In answer to certified questions, the supreme court of Tennessee held that the tolling provision of Tennessee's legal disability statute remains in effect as to plaintiffs of unsound mind for so long as they remain of unsound mind regardless of the appointment of a legal guardian and/or the commencement of a lawsuit by a representative on behalf of the disabled plaintiff; the discovery rule is inapplicable to plaintiffs of unsound mind for so long as they remain of unsound mind.

        Plain language of Tennessee's legal disability statute tolls the running of the statute of limitations while the claimant is either under the age of eighteen years, or of unsound mind; the disability of unsound mind is removed when the individual is no longer of unsound mind, due either to a change in the individual's condition or the individual's death and the statute contains no language which would lead the supreme court of Tennessee to conclude that the legislature intended for removal of either of these two disabilities upon appointment of a guardian.

        Whereas a plaintiff who is fired cannot exercise control over the triggering act or accrual date but must instead count the injury from the date of the employer's action terminating him, the plaintiff who submits his resignation thereby defines his own accrual date, and an employer who accepts the terms of the resignation is estopped to assert an earlier date.

        The discovery rule applies only in cases where the plaintiff does not discover and reasonably could not be expected to discover that he has a right of action; it does not permit a plaintiff to wait until he knows all of the injurious effects or consequences of a tortious act.

        An earlier manifestation of an asbestos-related disease (asbestosis) did not trigger the running of Tennessee's one-year statute of limitations on a separate, distinct, and later-manifested disease (mesothelioma) that was also caused by exposure to asbestos.

The public record was sufficient to alert the residents as to a possible connection between emissions from the nuclear weapons facilities and health risks; the residents should have been aware of a potential personal injury claim when a steering panel's preliminary reports on the emissions became available; the statute of limitations also applied to the residents' civil rights claims, because they did not seek to eliminate the vestige of past discrimination by asking for desegregation of part of the town surrounding the facilities because they were seeking remedies for potential personal injuries and property damage.

   Third party action by employer of injured person is a suit to recover damages for personal injuries since based on statutory subrogation, hence one year statute of limitations for personal injury suits applies.

        The limitation of an action for personal injuries, which resulted from the coal miner's breathing of dust produced by drilling, began to run from the time the injury was first inflicted, and not from the time the employee first obtained knowledge of the dangerous character of such dust.

        In an action for personal injury by a coal miner, for injury produced by inhaling dust, which produced the disease of silicosis, plaintiffs could recover damages sustained during the year prior to the institution of the suit.

        Where a coal miner seeks to recover damages resulting from silicosis contracted by inhaling dust produced by drilling, he cannot recover for negligent acts of the employer, which produced such disease, occurring more than a year prior to commencement of the action.

        One who had worked in a coal mine as a driver boss, mostly in the main entrance where the air currents were heavy, and was later removed to a sand house where he was engaged in drying river sand, and only occasionally was there dust in the process of sieving the sand, cannot recover damages resulting from silicosis, in the absence of a showing that the breathing of such dust produced by such work would cause such disease.

       <p>
        In an action by a coal miner for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by inhalation of fine particles of dust caused by the drilling and blasting operations, the allegation in the complaint that defendant, employer, negligently failed to warn plaintiff of the danger, thereby concealing the fact from plaintiff and keeping him ignorant of his right of action, is not a sufficient allegation of fraudulent concealment by defendant of plaintiff's cause of action, so as to toll the statute of limitations.

        A cause of action for libel in an “amended” complaint filed January 5, 1973, was barred by the statute of limitations since the original complaint was filed August 5, 1971, and was dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and where the record showed that the word “amended” had been stricken and a new civil action number assigned the second complaint was viewed as a new cause of action and the statute of limitations was not tolled since the libel action was not substantially the same cause of action as in the original complaint.

   The statutory exception (Acts 1990, ch. 1056, § 4) for previously-filed actions was merely a legislative recognition of the constitutionally-required separation of legislative and judicial powers, and did not deprive the supreme court of the power to abolish criminal conversation actions filed prior to the effective date of the 1990 amendment to this section by Acts 1990, ch. 1056 (January 1, 1991).

   The cause of action for seduction accrues when the first act of sexual intercourse is committed, but the statute of limitations does not begin to run against an action therefor, as long as the relations are continued, especially where the seduction was accomplished under promise of marriage, and the sexual intercourse was repeated and continued under a continuation and renewal of such promise. In such case, the statute begins to run from the last act of sexual intercourse, as seduction is, in such case, a continuous act. This is the rule, whether the action for the seduction is prosecuted by the female herself, or by her father. Thompson v. Clendening, 38 Tenn. 287, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 177 (1858); Davis v. Young, 90 Tenn. 303, 16 S.W. 473, 1891 Tenn. LEXIS 23 (1891); Ferguson v. Moore, 98 Tenn. 342, 39 S.W. 341, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 229 (Tenn. Dec. 1896); Heggie v.

        <p>
   Although the contract of marriage was not entered into prior to the first illicit act of sexual intercourse, if the contract existed thereafter concurrently with the illicit intercourse, such contract was sufficient to prevent the defendant from referring the statute of limitations to the first unlawful act.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to plead statute of limitations in an action for seduction where defendant had previously been required to plead his defenses specially, and where amendment was not sought until after plaintiff had introduced her evidence and rested, the court had overruled a motion for a directed verdict and plaintiff had been required to elect between the count for seduction and one for breach of promise to marry.

        Statute of limitations could not begin to run until the attorney's negligence had resulted in injury to the plaintiff and where there was no proof of such injury at time plaintiff was notified of agreed order, summary judgment holding action barred was improper.

        Where attorney, under contract with title company to transact its business, exercised little, if any, independence in carrying out his duties as an agent of the title company, relationship between the parties was that of principal and agent rather than client and attorney, making the one-year statute of limitations for professional negligence inapplicable to suit by title company against attorney.

        Because negligence without injury is not actionable, the legal malpractice statute of limitations does not begin to run until an attorney's negligence has actually injured the client; furthermore, there is no injury until there is the loss of a right, remedy, or interest or the imposition of a liability.

       <p>
        When a cause of action for legal malpractice accrues is determined by applying the discovery rule. Under this rule, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should know that an injury has been sustained as a result of wrongful or tortious conduct by the defendant. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The knowledge component of the discovery rule may be established by evidence of actual or constructive knowledge of the injury. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the theory of constructive knowledge, the statute of limitations may begin to run at an earlier date; that is, whenever the plaintiff becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that an injury has been sustained as a result of the defendant's negligent or wrongful conduct. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no requirement under the theory of constructive knowledge that the plaintiff actually know the specific type of legal claim he or she has, or that the injury constituted a breach of the appropriate legal standard; rather, the plaintiff is deemed to have discovered the right of action if the person is aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that the person has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>

        An actual injury occurs when there is the loss of a legal right, remedy or interest, or the imposition of a liability; and it may also take the form of the plaintiff being forced to take some action or otherwise suffer some actual inconvenience, such as incurring an expense, as a result of the defendant's negligent or wrongful act. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The injury element of the legal malpractice discovery rule is not met if it is contingent upon a third party's actions or amounts to a mere possibility. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs suffered an actual injury for purposes of the legal malpractice discovery rule when they began to incur expenses, or at least had to take some action, as a result of the defendant's negligent advice. John Kohl & Co. P.C. v. Dearborn & Ewing, 977 S.W.2d 528, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 546 (Tenn. 1998); Bradson Mercantile, Inc. v. Crabtree, 1 S.W.3d 648, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 98 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constructive knowledge of an injury in a legal malpractice action requires that the plaintiff know or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should know that he or she has sustained an injury as a result of the defendant's wrongful or tortious conduct. The plaintiff's knowledge need not rise to the level of an actual awareness that his or her injury constituted a breach of the appropriate legal standard. In this case, an issue of material fact remains as to whether divorce plaintiff knew or should have known of her attorney's allegedly wrongful trial conduct before she consulted another attorney. Tanaka v. Meares, 980 S.W.2d 210, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 319 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), review or rehearing denied, — S.W.2d —, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 635 (Tenn. Oct. 19, 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The cause of action accrued when the plaintiff first became aware that his initial case had been dismissed because of his first attorney's negligence, not when the judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the court of appeals. Wilkins v. Dodson, Parker, Shipley, Behm & Seaborg, 995 S.W.2d 575, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 751 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), aff'd, Brown v. Bruce Hardwood Floors, — S.W.2d —, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 752 (Tenn. Dec. 31, 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Client's cause of action for legal malpractice accrued when the client knew or should have known of his first attorney's alleged malpractice in suit against a bank following the client's attendance at a deposition in which the bank asserted a statute of limitations defense and pled the defense in its answer. Wilkins v. Dodson, Parker, Shipley, Behm & Seaborg, 995 S.W.2d 575, 1998 Tenn. App. LEXIS 751 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998), aff'd, Brown v. Bruce Hardwood Floors, — S.W.2d —, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 752 (Tenn. Dec. 31, 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiffs have suffered actual injury. Harriet & Henderson Yarns, Inc. v. Castle, 75 F. Supp. 2d 818, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20841 (W.D. Tenn. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff is deemed to have discovered the right of action if the person is aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that the person has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct. Wilson v. Mathes, 15 S.W.3d 865, 1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 726 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney's purposeful concealment from a client of facts that prevents the client from learning of an injury can toll the statute of limitations on legal malpractice; reliance upon erroneous legal advice cannot operate to toll the statute of limitations on legal malpractice inasmuch as the discovery rule relating to injury only applies to matters of fact unknown to a prospective plaintiff, not to matters of law. Cherry v. Williams, 36 S.W.3d 78, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 244 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A “continuing representation” argument is subsumed into the discovery rule; therefore, in the context of a legal malpractice claim, a litigant who learns that it has suffered a cognizable legal injury and that this injury was caused by the negligence of its lawyer but who continues to be represented by that lawyer will be forever barred from bringing suit against the lawyer unless it files suit within one year after the discovery of the injury and its cause. Cherry v. Williams, 36 S.W.3d 78, 2000 Tenn. App. LEXIS 244 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).

   Client's legal malpractice claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations of former T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104ol1a2" target="_self">28-3-104(a)(2)</a></cite> [now §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104ol1c" target="_self">28-3-104(c)</a></cite>], and therefore the attorneys were properly granted summary judgment, because the client knew or should have known that it had suffered a legally cognizable injury no later than March 3, 1994, the date it was served with a creditor's complaint to revoke the order confirming the reorganization plan, and the client did not sue the attorneys until February 2001. A tolling agreement entered into between the parties that deemed the client's complaint to have been filed on August 3, 1995, five months after the statute of limitations, did not preclude the attorneys from asserting the statute of limitations offense. Tenn-Fla Partners v. Shelton, 233 S.W.3d 825, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2007), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2007 Tenn. LEXIS 703 (Tenn. Aug. 13, 2007).

       <p>
        Client's legal malpractice complaint was filed beyond the one-year statute of limitations period, where the client was injured when it was hailed into court to defend the enforceability of a contract drawn up by the attorney and thus, the client knew of should have known of a “potential problem” with the contract at the time it was hailed into court, well over one year before filing the complaint. Cardiac Anesthesia Servs., PLLC v. Jones, 385 S.W.3d 530, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 217 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2012), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 598 (Tenn. Aug. 16, 2012).

   Law firms and attorneys were entitled to summary judgment in a client's legal malpractice action, concerning one attorney's alleged failure to file three QDROs and another attorney's alleged failure to monitor preparation of the QDROs, because the one-year limitations period in former T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104ol1a2" target="_self">28-3-104(a)(2)</a></cite> [now §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104ol1c" target="_self">28-3-104(c)</a></cite>] began to run in June 2008 when the client had actual notice the QDROs had not been filed, and, as such, the client's October 2009 complaint was untimely. Pier v. Jungkind, 427 S.W.3d 922, 2013 Tenn. App. LEXIS 232 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 8, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lender's action against an attorney was timely filed within the statute of limitations because the attorney made fraudulent misrepresentations when he drafted a deed of trust in favor of the lender, conveying title to land owned by the attorney's brother; nothing in the brother's bankruptcy filings would have caused the lender to discover the nature of its injury suffered by reason of the defective and improper drafting of the deed of trust.

       <p>
        Former clients'  legal malpractice complaint against attorneys who represented them in an underlying lawsuit was untimely filed because, although the clients contended that the statute of limitation on their suit did not begin to run until the last defendant in their underlying lawsuit was dismissed, the statute of limitation began to run when their claims against two of the three defendants in their underlying lawsuit were dismissed as the clients then had sufficient knowledge of an injury, which was likely based on some legal malpractice. Story v. Bunstein, — S.W.3d —, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 400 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2016), rev'd, Story v. Bunstine, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 747 (Tenn. Dec. 11, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly dismissed the malpractice claim against the attorney because the claim was time-barred; information about the fraudulent nature of the transaction in question was available to the clients in May and August of 2012, and if the disclosure of such information caused the agreed judgments to become worthless, then the clients knew or should have known of this injury in August 2012 at the latest, and the filing of the complaint was not timely.

        The Tennessee formulation of the discovery rule articulated in Carvell and again in John Kohl & Co. was the appropriate analysis for determining when a claim of legal malpractice accrued. Accordingly, Tennessee courts have declined to adopt the continuing representation rule and the appeal-tolling doctrine and have declined to hold that a final judgment was required before there was an actual injury for purposes of accrual. Story v. Bunstine, — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. LEXIS 747 (Tenn. Dec. 11, 2017).

        Trial court properly granted attorneys'  motion for summary judgment because a client's legal malpractice action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations; the client's injury stemming from the attorneys'  representation in a federal case, and the client's knowledge of that alleged injury, occurred on the day that the district court entered judgment on April 28, 2014, but the client did not file his legal malpractice case until October 21, 2015.

        This section applied to an action for conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his constitutional rights consummated by securing plaintiff's conviction and imprisonment for robbery and was not tolled during the time plaintiff was imprisoned, there being no statutory provision for such tolling.

       <p>
        In order to establish the essential elements of a malicious prosecution claim in Tennessee, a plaintiff must show that: (1) prior suit or judicial proceeding was brought against the plaintiff without probable cause, (2) the defendant brought the prior action with malice, and (3) the prior action was finally terminated in favor of the plaintiff.

   Partial summary judgment was granted to a college chancellor on civil rights claims by former faculty members because, since the original and first amended complaints stated that the chancellor was being sued in his official capacity only, he had no reason to know that he might have faced liability individually until the second amended complaint had been filed, after the statute of limitations under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-104" target="_self">28-3-104</a></cite> had expired and well after the 120-day period set forth in Fed.

Given the Rule 12(b)(6) stage of the case, the deputies deserved limited discovery on at least two points: (1) when and how the county informed the deputies they would have to participate in the promotions process and the nature of the notice and (2) the timing of the promotions posting.

        Trial court should not have dismissed a civil rights case based on the one-year limitations period under state law because the complaint sufficiently alleged post-contract formation conduct, and the four year statute of limitations for federal law applied instead.

   T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite> is a statute of repose which is entirely unrelated to the accrual of any cause of action, since it begins to run on the date of substantial completion as opposed to the date of injury or damage; the dates of injury and discovery do not matter to this statute of repose which establishes a ceiling beyond which the cause of action cannot exist from the date of substantial completion. Therefore, the traditional three-year statute of limitations for injury to property found at T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-105" target="_self">28-3-105</a></cite>, cannot extend the existence of a cause of action outside the ceiling superimposed by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite>.

        Where a suit for the recovery of personal property has been commenced within the three years, but has abated by the death of the plaintiff, a new suit may be commenced within one year thereafter. But if the new suit is brought after that time, though within a year from the suggestion of his death and the record of abatement made, it is too late. Norment v. Smith, 20 Tenn. 46, 1839 Tenn.

        In a real property dispute, because plaintiffs'  claim for damages for emotional distress was merely an element of their overall claim for damages for the injury to their property, and not a stand-alone cause of action, the three-year property tort statute of limitations applied, and the court of appeals erred in holding that the one-year personal injury statute of limitations barred plaintiffs'  claim for damages for emotional distress.

        Trial court erred by granting the homeowners'  association's motion to dismiss the homeowner's negligence claim on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired, as the homeowners'  amendment to the complaint should have related back to the buyer's original complaint, as the buyer's compliant put the association on notice of the alleged water pipeline break, which was the common set of operational facts giving rise to the homeowners'  claims, the original complaint sufficiently identified that property allegedly damaged by the association, the homeowners'  amendment alleged identical theories of recovery, and the court perceived no reason why the relation back would prejudice the association.

        The open, adverse, and continued possession of personal property, by a person claiming to be the owner, is a fact to be made out affirmatively by him who insists upon the protection of the statute, and is not made out where there seems to have been no open and public possession of the property by anybody for such period.

        Where a father merely transmits to his daughter the use and possession of personal property, without any explanation of the transaction indicating whether under a bailment or gift, and the daughter, with her husband, retains the possession for a period of three years, the presumption is against a gift, and it devolves upon them, if they assert a title by lapse of time, to show that the property was claimed by them adversely, for the period of three years, and that such adverse claim was known to the father.

        The law presumes that one who acquires possession of personal property to hold in subordination to the title of the true owner continues to hold in the same right and to displace this presumption, the fact must be affirmatively proved, by clear and convincing evidence, not merely that he held possession for himself and adversely to the true owner, for the length of time required to give title by the statute but that the true owner had full knowledge of such adverse claim and holding during all that period of time.

        The possession of personalty by the life tenant is in perfect harmony with the rights of the remaindermen, and is incapable in law of becoming adverse to their rights. A purchaser from the life tenant can acquire nothing greater than a life estate, and, in effect, stands in his vendor's shoes; and the possession of such purchaser is precisely similar to the possession of his vendor (the life tenant), and he cannot, by adverse holding, during the existence of the life estate, acquire a valid title to the property, as against the remaindermen. Woodson v. Smith, 38 Tenn. 276, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1858).

        The successive possessions of successive wrongdoers cannot be connected, so as to make out the time required to create the bar and vest the title in the last possessor, because each possession is a substantive wrong for which an action would lie. Even where the wrongful adverse possession of personalty by a decedent had not vested the title in him at the time of his death, the possession of his personal representative was his own possession, and being wrongful, would not connect itself with such wrongful possession of the decedent. Norment v. Smith, 20 Tenn. 46, 1839 Tenn. LEXIS 8 (1839); Moffatt v. Buchanan, 30 Tenn. 369, 1850 Tenn. LEXIS 133, 26 Am. Dec. 270 (1850); Moffitt v. McDonald, 30 Tenn. 457, 1850 Tenn.

        The law presumes that one joint owner in possession of personalty is holding the same for all the joint owners or tenants in common; and, to remove such presumption, he must prove affirmatively, by clear and convincing evidence, not merely that he held the possession solely for himself, and adversely to his cotenants, for the three years required to give title by the statute of limitations, but, in addition, that his cotenants had full knowledge of such adverse claim and holding during all that period of time.

        Assuming that an action for an accounting brought by a property owner against a friend who was entrusted with property of the owner was an action for conversion, the cause of action accrued when the owner wrote to the friend asking for an accounting, since a reasonable inference from the letter was that the owner was unaware that the friend intended to exercise dominion and control over the property in a manner that was inconsistent with the owner's rights.

        Seller's action was time-barred because the seller sought damages for the loss in value of the seller's property caused by the buyer's breach of the sales contract and, with the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, the seller should have discovered the injury by reviewing the deed, which did not contain a provision in the contract, at the real estate closing.

        It was undisputed that the three-year statute of limitations for injuries to personal property applied to the buyer's claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the agent, and the trial court properly applied the discovery rule to determine when the buyer knew or should have known that he suffered an injury due to the agent's failure to ensure timely delivery of a loan declination letter.

        Buyer acknowledged that his review of the facsimile transmission from the seller to the agent by August 10, 2009 caused him to inquire into whether the agent effectively delivered a loan declination letter, and thus he was placed on constructive notice of his alleged injury by at least that date, and this caused the running of the limitations period to begin, and the action was time-barred.

        Although concealment of a cause of action has been held to toll the statute, it must be shown that the defendant took affirmative steps to conceal the cause of action and that the plaintiff could not have discovered his cause of action despite exercising reasonable diligence; thus, where the record revealed that the plaintiff postal worker failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence in making an effort to discover any cause of action he might have had against the named defendants, the district court did not err when it held that his claim for interference with property and contractual rights was time barred since it was filed more than three years after the alleged wrongful actions of the defendants.

   The U.S. court of appeals for the sixth circuit and the Tennessee supreme court both require essentially the same proof of fraudulent concealment; U.S. court of appeals requires the plaintiff to show: (1) wrongful concealment of their actions by the defendants; (2) failure of the plaintiff to discover the operative facts that are the basis of his cause of action within the limitations period; and (3) plaintiff's due diligence until discovery of the facts.

        In a case involving plaintiff's purchase of real property and the alleged fraud by others as to the property's real value, plaintiff's complaint was dismissed because, although plaintiff's pro se complaint included a count designated “breach of contract,” that claim was another iteration of his claim for fraud in the inducement with a “breach of contract” label; and, at the very latest, plaintiff stated in his complaint that he knew he was being induced into paying an inflated price for the property as of his default in 2011; thus, the court did not err when it ruled as a matter of law that plaintiff's claim for “breach of contract” was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, as a matter of law, when he filed his complaint in 2016.

        This statute does not embrace a case of the failure to pay over money collected upon process, unless there has been an actual return of the process to the tribunal issuing it, with the official indorsement thereon showing the same to be satisfied, or showing the collection of the money, and does not apply where there has been no return of the execution.

        In determining whether the purpose of an action is to recover damages which are personal, to property, or on account of a breach of contract, the court must look to the complaint and ascertain the basis for which damages are sought.

   Company's reliance on the amended restrictive covenants in its answer did not constitute an action; the statute of limitations in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-109ol1a3" target="_self">28-3-109(a)(3)</a></cite> does not operate to bar the litigation of an issue introduced as a defense rather than a claim, and having determined that the statute of limitations applies only to actions, and no action challenging the amended restrictive covenants had been filed in this case, the statute was inapplicable.

        Plaintiff's action suing attorney for mishandling of divorce case claiming “not only loss of properties but … pain and mental anguish” was controlled by one year statute of limitations for personal actions rather than six year contract statute.

   Because the question of when a hazardous chemical clean-up company had notice of a business' intention not to pay for services rendered was a matter of the company's story versus the business's story, and because the trial court was in a better position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and ultimately favored the company's version of events, the court found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the finding that the lawsuit for breach of contract was timely filed under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-109ol1a3" target="_self">28-3-109(a)(3)</a></cite>; in any event, given the fact that the agreement in question contemplated a 10-day payment grace period, the court could not say that the company should have been charged with notice of repudiation until such time as that 10 days had elapsed, and the lawsuit was filed within six years of that date.

        Although plaintiff presented a claim with a legal basis of breach of contract, plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to state a breach of an enforceable contract claim upon which relief could be granted because plaintiff did not prove that the hospital had entered into a contract in which it agreed that all possible complications and resultant treatment plaintiff might need subsequent to the bariatric surgery would be covered by his advance payment; however, the finding of prejudice did not apply to plaintiff's breach of contract claim, and plaintiff could file a new action alleging breach of contract, provided that he did so within the six-year statute of limitations.

        The defense of the statute of limitations is personal to the debtor and those in privity of estate with him, but there are exceptions to this rule, which permit, under some circumstances, judgment creditors of the common debtor to plead the bar of the statute on behalf of the debtor, but does not permit a judgment creditor to avail himself of the statute as against another creditor where the debtor has waived the benefit of the statutory limitation by a new promise.

        To revive a barred debt, by an acknowledgment of the debt as a subsisting obligation, and a promise to pay it, express or implied, made to a third person, it must appear that the debtor intended the acknowledgment and promise to be communicated to the creditor, or there must be such privity between such third person and the creditor that it might be fairly presumed that such communication was intended. Thompson v. French, 18 Tenn. 452, 1837 Tenn. LEXIS 53 (1837); Bachman v. Roller, 68 Tenn. 409, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 36, 40 Am. Rep. 97 (1877); Roller v. Bachman, 73 Tenn. 153, 1880 Tenn.

       </p>
       <p>
        The acknowledgment of the indebtedness and the expressed willingness, and even anxiety, to pay, within the period of limitation, made by one joint debtor to the other, is not, of itself, sufficient to revive or keep alive the indebtedness; but if the promise was intended to be, and was, in fact, communicated to the creditor and accepted or acted upon by him, it will be sufficient for that purpose. Fuqua v. Dinwiddie, 74 Tenn. 645, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 190 (1881).

        A new promise, made after the remedy is barred by the statute of limitations, creates a new contract, and a new cause of action. Muse v. Donelson, 21 Tenn. 166, 1840 Tenn.

        Unsecured creditor's claim on Chapter 13 debtor's credit card account was time barred because listing of claim in debtor's schedules did not create an acknowledgment by the debtor sufficient to revive the creditor's time barred claim, and, even if that was sufficient to revive the debt, it would not be binding on the trustee and the estate. In re Shippy, — B.R. —, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 916 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. Mar. 23, 2016).

        A claim barred by the statute of limitations is deemed in law to be extinguished and discharged, although it is sufficient consideration for a new promise to pay the debt, which revives the old debt. Belote's Ex'rs v. Wynne, 15 Tenn. 533, 15 Tenn. 534, 1835 Tenn. LEXIS 43 (1835); Woodlie v. Towles, 68 Tenn. 592, 1877 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1877).

       </p>

        Whether the new promise revives the old cause of action, or creates a new cause of action founded on the old consideration, is immaterial. Hannah v. Hawkins, 73 Tenn. 240, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 116 (1880); Jordan v. Jordan, 85 Tenn. 561, 3 S.W. 896, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 83 (1887).

        In action by bank on August 5, 1944 to recover on note dated November 5, 1928, testimony of cashier and former assistant cashier that decedent stated in March, 1940 that he would pay the note was sufficient to make out a new promise and remove bar of statute of limitations.

        In the absence of evidence to the contrary, part payment of a debt (note) or payment of interest on a debt is an acknowledgment of the debt and implies a promise of payment which operates to keep the debt alive for the statutory period from the time of such payment.

        An action for the use and occupation of land may be brought after the legal right to the land is established by judgment in ejectment. Therefore, the statute of limitations does not begin to run against an action of trespass for mesne profits until after the judgment in ejectment. The recovery is not confined to the period of limitation running back from the institution of the suit for the rents, but extends back to the date of the demise laid in the declarations. However, where the suit is in contract, waiving the tort, the plaintiff can only recover rents for six years next before the institution of his suit therefor. Avent v. Hord, 40 Tenn. 458, 1859 Tenn.

   Because a trial court's order failed to delineate its award regarding purchasers'  counterclaim, the matter was remanded to the trial court for a determination of the basis for the award of unspecified, unrecovered costs in favor of the purchasers; because the purchasers'  counterclaim was filed beyond the three-year statute of limitations, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-105" target="_self">28-3-105</a></cite>, an award based on the lost equipment profit was time-barred, but in so far as the counterclaim sought to recover for magazine advertising, direct labor related to equipment, and auction costs, those claims were not injuries to personal property and were governed by the six-year statute of limitations for breach of contract, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-109" target="_self">28-3-109</a></cite>.

        Applicable statute of limitations was the six-year statute of limitations for actions on contracts, not the three-year statute of limitations for injuries to personal property, because an estate's description of the payment to a surviving spouse as “wrongful” and “inappropriate” did not create a tort claim, but rather, the gravamen of the estate's complaint was an action on a contract; the estate sought the return of the funds distributed to the surviving spouse under the settlement agreement.

        Where a real estate agency was retained to sell real property held by a partnership in bankruptcy, where the property was sold and the real estate agency was informed that its commission would be paid by amounts held in escrow in the bankruptcy court, and where those escrow funds were disbursed but none of the funds were paid to the real estate agency to pay its commission, the real estate agency's suit to recover its commission was not barred by the statute of limitations because the cause of action did not accrue until the real estate agency's demand for the commission was not satisfied after the escrow funds were released.

        Class action tolling doctrine was consistent with Tennessee law and the trial court erred in failing to invoke same as to the replacement workers'  individual claims of breach of contract and interference with contract; the doctrine of laches did not prevent the replacement workers from maintaining their claims, in part, because they were not sleeping on their rights when they trusted the former class action plaintiffs to adequately represent their interests.

        In an expert's breach of contract action to recover unpaid fees, the trial court erred in granting an attorney's motion for summary judgment because disputed issues of material fact existed as to whether equitable estoppel tolled the statute of limitations; the expert showed promises to pay his claim within the statute upon which he relied, and he acted diligently by filing suit just over one year after the decision affirming the dismissal of the wrongful death action for which he was hired.

   Trial court erred in granting the zoning applicants'  motion under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6) to dismiss his neighbors'  challenge of the Zoning Resolution approving his 10-acre skeet field because the 10-year statute of limitations, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-110" target="_self">28-3-110</a></cite>, was inapplicable where the Resolution described 90 acres instead of the 10-acre tract and no amendment had been submitted or public hearing held on an amendment as required by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.13.html#t13c07s13-7-105" target="_blank">13-7-105</a></cite>; thus, the purportedly amended Resolution was void ab initio.

        Cause of action on a judgment accrues for purpose of the statute of limitation on the date of entry of the judgment, and to hold otherwise would create a conflict between the statute and the rule; the statute would permit revival of a judgment more than 10 years after the judgment's entry, and the rule would permit revival only by motion filed within 10 years of the judgment's entry, and such a conflict must be resolved in favor of the rule and its limitation of the time a request for revival might be sought.

        The exemptions from the operation of the statutes of limitation usually accorded to infants and married women, do not rest upon any general doctrine of the law that they cannot be subjected to their action but in every instance upon express language in these statutes giving them time, after majority or after cessation of coverture, to assert their rights.

        The relation of guardian and ward is such that the possession of the title of the property is in the ward and that the possession of the guardian is the possession of the ward and will inure to the ward's benefit under the statute of limitations.

This bar is applicable in equity as at law, and as applicable to suits against the representative upon the personal trusts arising from his office, as to a suit technically on his bond. Alvis v.

   Under the provision of this section, judgments against personal representatives would authorize suits to subject the land of the decedent to the payment of his debts, within 10 years after the rendition of such judgment; but the provision of this section is so modified by the provisions of §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-102" target="_self">28-3-102</a></cite>, that the suit to subject the land must be instituted within seven years after the rendition of such judgment.

        Manifestly this statute applies only to final judgments and decrees, and it cannot operate upon interlocutory decrees; and, therefore, the enforcement of a decree for the sale of land to satisfy a debt is not barred by a delay of 10 or more years in its execution, where the cause remains in court during that interval.

        Although payment of the judgment was conditioned on future events, parts could be enforced upon entry, as the husband could file for a lien against the wife's real property and he could record a judgment lien by statute; thus, the husband's cause of action accrued on entry of the judgment against the wife and not upon the subsequent sale of the real property, and having been filed more than 10 years after the entry the judgment, the husband's motion for revival should have been denied based on the statute of limitations.

   Ten-year period of limitation applies to suit by city to enforce special assessment lien by virtue of provision of this section applying 10-year period to “all other cases not expressly provided for.” Knoxville v.

   The acceleration clause in Private Acts 1911, ch. 501, § 18, providing that all unpaid instalments on serial obligations for assessments levied for street improvements became due upon default in payment of any instalment, was for the benefit of the city, and where the city did not invoke the acceleration clause upon default of first instalments, the statute of limitations did not begin to run upon all instalments, and the city was not barred from collecting later instalments which had been in default less than 10 years.

         Construction statute of repose was a complete defense to plaintiff's construction negligence claim as: (1) the CT room was used for its intended purpose starting in 2006; (2) the construction project was substantially complete on or about March 23, 2006; (3) no exception to the statute of repose applied as the hospital was in ownership, possession, and control of the CT room at all relevant times, and the fact that a construction defect existed and went unnoticed did not in itself constitute fraud or wrongful concealment; and (4) the case was filed more than four years after the CT room project was substantially completed.

         Architectural firm and its principal architect were not entitled to summary judgment on a hotel owner's claims of breach of contract and professional liability because they failed to establish that the owner's causes of action accrued more than three years before the owner filed the lawsuit, as they did not establish that their services were substantially completed under the terms of the parties'  contract more than three years before the hotel owner filed the lawsuit.

         This section operates without regard to the date of discovery of an injury or damage and without distinction between personal injury and property damage. Harper v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 498 F.

         This statute applies only to claims involving the construction of some kind of improvement and not to claims of concealment or failure to disclose periodic heavy flooding. Chrisman v. Hill Home Dev., 978 S.W.2d 535, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. 1998).

         As owner of the levee at the time it allegedly caused plaintiffs'  loss, the company could not assert the statute of repose as a defense. KMI Grp., Inc. v. Wade Acres, LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 169 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 5, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court erred by granting the independent contractor summary judgment in the worker's product liability action based on the statute of repose because the court determined that the daily removal and installation of insulation at an industrial facility over the course of many years indicated that existing insulation was merely being repaired and replaced, and that such activity did not constitute “construction of an improvement to real property” within the meaning of this section. Coffman v. Armstrong Int'l, — S.W.3d —, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 357 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 22, 2019).

         The word “design” does not mean the general design of a manufactured product which might be used in improvements to real estate; rather, the meaning of the word is limited to the architectural or engineering design of a particular building or the particular parts thereof. Pridemark Custom Plating, Inc. v. Upjohn Co., 702 S.W.2d 566, 1985 Tenn. App. LEXIS 3053 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985), superseded by statute as stated in, Wheeler v.

         Under this part, a person who suffers personal injuries as the result of situations covered by the statute within four years of substantial completion of the improvement can bring suit within one year after the date of injury. Leyen v. Dunn, 62 Tenn. App. 239, 461 S.W.2d 41, 1970 Tenn. App. LEXIS 264 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1970).

        <p>
         In wrongful death action against apartment owner arising from a fire where apartment owner answered bringing in as third-party defendants the general contractor, the architect, and certain engineers, action was barred under this section as to third-party defendants because building was substantially completed more than four years prior to bringing of action. Agus v. Future Chattanooga Development Corp., 358 F. Supp. 246, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13983 (E.D. Tenn. 1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         An action for personal injury arising from defects in improvement of real estate must be commenced within one year after the date of the injury or the date the injury was discovered or should have been discovered with reasonable care and diligence and within four years after substantial completion of the improvement unless the injury occurs in the fourth year after substantial completion in which case the action must be brought within one year from the date of injury. Watts v. Putnam County, 525 S.W.2d 488, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 659 (Tenn. 1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         An action for property damage arising from defects in improvement of real estate must be commenced within three years after the date of the damage or the date the damage was discovered or should have been discovered with reasonable care and diligence, and within four years after substantial completion of the improvement unless the damage occurs in the fourth year after substantial completion in which case the action must be commenced within one year from the date of damage. Watts v. Putnam County, 525 S.W.2d 488, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 659 (Tenn. 1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where school wall collapsed 10 years after its construction, the one-year statute of limitation was a bar to an action against the architect for personal injury. Hill v. Chattanooga, 533 S.W.2d 311, 1975 Tenn. App. LEXIS 163 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         The general assembly could fairly conclude that four years is a reasonable time limitation with respect to construction and that most structural, design and construction defects resulting in injury should become apparent within that period. Harmon v. Angus R. Jessup Associates, Inc., 619 S.W.2d 522, 1981 Tenn. LEXIS 468 (Tenn. 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         <p>
   Regardless of how the homeowners'  claim was couched, the case at hand was an action to recover damages for any deficiency in the design, planning, supervision, observation of construction, or construction of an improvement to real property, for injury to property, real or personal, arising out of any such deficiency, T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite>; the material substantive allegations of the homeowners'  complaint related to the builder's alleged negligence in the construction of the house and the trial court did not err in applying §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite> to the complaint and bar the complaint. Henry v. Cherokee Constr. &amp; Supply Co., 301 S.W.3d 263, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 118 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err when it found there was no genuine dispute regarding the date of substantial completion because the room at issue was, in fact, used for its intended purpose on that date. Phillips v. Covenant Health, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 448 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statute of limitations that governed actions based on defects to improvements in real property did not bar homeowners action against a contractor, when a garage which the contractor built for the homeowners partially collapsed, because the contractor engaged in fraudulent conduct with respect to construction of the garage. As a result, the statutory exception for fraud applied to remove the action from the four-year limitations period. McCollum v. Peters, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 589 (Tenn. Ct.

         The general assembly did not intend to extend the time for bringing suit for property tort actions from three years from the accruing of the cause of action to four years. Kingsport v. SCM Corp., 352 F. Supp. 288, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11341 (E.D. Tenn. 1972).

        <p>
         This statute applies to nuisance claims and not just to claims based on negligence. To exempt nuisance claims from this statute would defeat the legislative intent of insulating contractors, architects, engineers and others from liability for defective construction or design of improvements to realty where the injury happens more than four years after substantial completion of the improvement. Chrisman v. Hill Home Dev., 978 S.W.2d 535, 1998 Tenn. LEXIS 607 (Tenn. 1998).

         There is no indication in these statutes of limitations that building subcontractors or craftsmen are to be automatically discharged from liability simply because of completion and acceptance of the work. Johnson v. Oman Constr. Co., 519 S.W.2d 782, 1975 Tenn. LEXIS 713 (Tenn. 1975).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was not reversible error to decline to add a medical center as a party to a construction negligence case because the statute of repose still would have defeated plaintiff's claims. Raby v. Covenant Health, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 451 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2015).

   T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite> is a statute of repose which is entirely unrelated to the accrual of any cause of action, since it begins to run on the date of substantial completion as opposed to the date of injury or damage; the dates of injury and discovery do not matter to this statute of repose which establishes a ceiling beyond which the cause of action cannot exist from the date of substantial completion. Therefore, the traditional three-year statute of limitations for injury to property found at T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-105" target="_self">28-3-105</a></cite>, cannot extend the existence of a cause of action outside the ceiling superimposed by T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite>.

   There was no question but that the project was substantially completed more than four years before the filing of suit, the homeowners agreed that the project was completed in 1998, and the contention that T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite> could not apply simply because of a failure to abate was rejected.

         In a construction negligence case, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants based on the statute of repose because there was no genuine dispute that the date of substantial completion of the CT room for the hospital was on or about March 23, 2006, and plaintiffs did not file their lawsuit until January 2014, which was well after the four year statute of repose had expired; and the exceptions to the statute of repose did not apply as the hospital, and not defendants, was in ownership, possession, and control of the CT room at all relevant times in the case; and, although plaintiffs alleged that defendants falsely or deceptively omitted material facts regarding the defect, they did not specify how.

   Trial court did not err in finding that the wrongful concealment exception found in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-205" target="_self">28-3-205</a></cite> did not apply because the homeowners made no allegation that the builder did anything to conceal the cause of action once it arose; in the absence of an alleged overt act or affirmative representation, the homeowners could not rely upon the wrongful concealment exception to the statute of repose. Henry v. Cherokee Constr. &amp; Supply Co., 301 S.W.3d 263, 2009 Tenn. App. LEXIS 118 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2009).

   Trial court erred by granting the independent contractor summary judgment in the worker's product liability action based on the statute of repose because the court determined that the daily removal and installation of insulation at an industrial facility over the course of many years indicated that existing insulation was merely being repaired and replaced, and that such activity did not constitute “construction of an improvement to real property” within the meaning of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite>.

   Where a dangerous condition was not concealed or hidden but was openly visible to the plaintiff and all others, this section, which provides that one guilty of fraud or who conceals a cause of action tolls the four-year period of limitation provided in §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite>, does not apply. Wallace v. Knoxville's Community Development Corp., 568 S.W.2d 107, 1978 Tenn. App. LEXIS 288 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         None of the statutory exceptions applied because a hospital was in ownership, possession, and control of the room at all relevant times, and the worker did not plead fraud or wrongful concealment with sufficient particularity; the fact that a construction defect exists and goes unnoticed does not in itself constitute fraud or wrongful concealment.

   Since plaintiff failed to state the circumstances constituting fraudulent concealment with particularity, as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 9.02, plaintiff could not show that defendant's fraudulent misrepresentation/concealment tolled the statute of repose in T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t28c03s28-3-202" target="_self">28-3-202</a></cite>. Counts Co. v. Praters, Inc., 392 S.W.3d 80, 2012 Tenn. App. LEXIS 426 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 22, 2012), appeal denied, Counts Co., LLC v. Praters, Inc., — S.W.3d —, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 776 (Tenn.

        <p>
         In a construction negligence case, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants based on the statute of repose because there was no genuine dispute that the date of substantial completion of the CT room for the hospital was on or about March 23, 2006, and plaintiffs did not file their lawsuit until January 2014, which was well after the four year statute of repose had expired; and the exceptions to the statute of repose did not apply as the hospital, and not defendants, was in ownership, possession, and control of the CT room at all relevant times in the case; and, although plaintiffs alleged that defendants falsely or deceptively omitted material facts regarding the defect, they did not specify how. Ridenour v. Covenant Health, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 447 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         No exception to the statute of repose applied to the radiology patients'  tort claims against the engineering and architectural firms where the hospital was in ownership, possession, and control of the CT room at all relevant times, the patients had not alleged fraud with sufficient particularity, and the fact that a construction defect existed and went unnoticed did not in itself constitute fraud or wrongful concealment. Lewellen v. Covenant Health, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 450 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Construction statute of repose was a complete defense to plaintiff's construction negligence claim as: (1) the CT room was used for its intended purpose starting in 2006; (2) the construction project was substantially complete on or about March 23, 2006; (3) no exception to the statute of repose applied as the hospital was in ownership, possession, and control of the CT room at all relevant times, and the fact that a construction defect existed and went unnoticed did not in itself constitute fraud or wrongful concealment; and (4) the case was filed more than four years after the CT room project was substantially completed.

         Statute of limitations that governed actions based on defects to improvements in real property did not bar homeowners action against a contractor, when a garage which the contractor built for the homeowners partially collapsed, because the contractor engaged in fraudulent conduct with respect to construction of the garage. As a result, the statutory exception for fraud applied to remove the action from the four-year limitations period. McCollum v. Peters, — S.W.3d —, 2015 Tenn. App. LEXIS 589 (Tenn. Ct.
