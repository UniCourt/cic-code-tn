       Compiler's Notes. The Securities Law of 1955, formerly codified as §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653, was repealed by Acts 1980, ch. 886, § 27. However, the section also contained a savings provision referring to former §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653 which read:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the Act was July 2, 1980.

      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed.

      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.

      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”

        Where no evidence was offered to the effect that the defendants were issuing “notes” or “evidences of indebtedness,” much less that they were issuing either “in a mercantile or consumer transaction,” the trial court had no obligation to instruct the jury concerning issues not fairly raised by the evidence presented at trial.

        There was no error in dismissing a claim for violations of the Tennessee Securities Act of 1980 because an investment was excluded from the registration requirements since it involved exchanging cash in return for obtaining a portion of cash or currency located somewhere in England. There was no investment contract shown based on the fact that reasonable reliance was not shown. Estate of Lambert v. Fitzgerald, 497 S.W.3d 425, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 298 (Tenn. Ct.

       The Securities Law of 1955, formerly codified as §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653, was repealed by Acts 1980, ch. 886, § 27. However, the section also contained a savings provision referring to former §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653 which read:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the Act was July 2, 1980.

       Acts 2002, ch. 700, § 8 provided that the commissioner of commerce and insurance may promulgate rules and regulations, including public necessity rules (now emergency rules) and regulations, to administer the provisions of this part. Such rules and regulations shall be promulgated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2014, ch. 943, § 2 provided that the exemption created by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c01s48-1-103ol1a13" target="_self">48-1-103(a)(13)</a></cite> shall be known and may be cited as the “Invest Tennessee Exemption.”

       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”

        Where the commissioner issued a cease and desist order requiring plaintiff to refrain from engaging in business as an unregistered broker-dealer or selling unregistered securities, which purported to restrain only unlawful conduct and was accompanied by notice of opportunity for a full hearing, and there was no allegation or evidence that the commissioner had or was about to seek judicial enforcement of the cease and desist order, the issuance of the cease and desist order by an administrative official without prior notice and hearing was not so extreme and confiscatory as to invoke extraordinary judicial powers to vacate it.

        There was no error in dismissing a claim for violations of the Tennessee Securities Act of 1980 because an investment was excluded from the registration requirements since it involved exchanging cash in return for obtaining a portion of cash or currency located somewhere in England. There was no investment contract shown based on the fact that reasonable reliance was not shown. Estate of Lambert v. Fitzgerald, 497 S.W.3d 425, 2016 Tenn. App. LEXIS 298 (Tenn. Ct.

       Compiler's Notes. The Securities Law of 1955, formerly codified as §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653, was repealed by Acts 1980, ch. 886, § 27. However, the section also contained a savings provision referring to former §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653 which read:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the Act was July 2, 1980.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2001, ch. 61, § 1 provided that the act shall be cited as “The Securities Omnibus Act of 2001.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2002, ch. 700, § 8 provided that the commissioner of commerce and insurance may promulgate rules and regulations, including public necessity rules (now emergency rules) and regulations, to administer the provisions of this part. Such rules and regulations shall be promulgated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5.

       Compiler's Notes. The Securities Law of 1955, formerly codified as §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653, was repealed by Acts 1980, ch. 886, § 27. However, the section also contained a savings provision referring to former §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653 which read:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the Act was July 2, 1980.

        A discretionary power vested in the commissioner to issue a permit to investment company could not be considered in a collateral proceeding upon a note given for stock of a corporation holding such permit.

        Commissioner's issuance of a permit was conclusive that investment corporation had in all respects complied with Acts 1913 (1st .S.), ch. 31 in an action involving the validity of the contract made by the corporation, provided that the documents had been filed for the commissioner's examination, as required, but the permit is not conclusive where such documents have not been filed.

       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”

       Compiler's Notes. The Securities Law of 1955, formerly codified as §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653, was repealed by Acts 1980, ch. 886, § 27. However, the section also contained a savings provision referring to former §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653 which read:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”

       The effective date of the Act was July 2, 1980.

        Trial court erred in dismissing investors'  claims of common-law fraud and misrepresentation, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty claims made against their investment advisor, at the summary judgment stage, because, the investors claimed that the advisor recommended that they made investments he knew were risky despite the fact that they told him they wanted to make safe, conservative investments and the advisor received a larger commission on those investments while the investors sustained significant financial losses as a result of his representations that their investments were safe.

        While providing a prospectus may satisfy the disclosure requirements in SEC Rule 10b-5(b), it does not necessarily foreclose other federal claims; and by the same token, the court declined to find that providing a client with a prospectus is a complete defense, as a matter of law, to state claims that the stock broker or investment advisor misrepresented facts or failed to disclose facts material to his or her client's investment decisions. Johnson v. John Hancock Funds, 217 S.W.3d 414, 2006 Tenn. App. LEXIS 447 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, Johnson v. John Hancock Funds, LLC, — S.W.3d —, 2006 Tenn. LEXIS 1114 (Tenn.

       Compiler's Notes. The Securities Law of 1955, formerly codified as §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653, was repealed by Acts 1980, ch. 886, § 27. However, the section also contained a savings provision referring to former §§ 48-1601 — 48-1653 which read:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)  Prior law exclusively governs all suits, actions, prosecutions, or proceedings which are pending or may be initiated on the basis of facts or circumstances occurring before the effective date of this Act, except that no civil suit or action may be maintained to enforce any liability under prior law unless brought within any period of limitation which applied when the cause of action accrued and in any event within two years after the effective date of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the Act was July 2, 1980.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2003, ch. 100, § 3 provided that the amendment to subsection (h) shall apply to all proceedings addressed by this part that are commenced on or after May 7, 2003.

        Trial court erred in dismissing investors'  claims of common-law fraud and misrepresentation, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty claims made against their investment advisor, at the summary judgment stage, because, the investors claimed that the advisor recommended that they made investments he knew to be risky despite the fact that they told him they wanted to make safe, conservative investments and the advisor received a larger commission on those investments while the investors sustained significant financial losses as a result of his representations that their investments were safe.

        While providing a prospectus may satisfy the disclosure requirements in SEC Rule 10b-5(b), codified in 17 CFR 240.10b-5(b), it does not necessarily foreclose other federal claims; and by the same token, the court declined to find that providing a client with a prospectus is a complete defense, as a matter of law, to state claims that the stock broker or investment advisor misrepresented facts or failed to disclose facts material to his or her client's investment decisions.

        Where trustees of retirement plans alleged that securities brokers were liable for their registered agent's theft of plans'  funds which were entrusted to the agent for investment, the agent could only deal in securities based on registration with the brokers, and thus the brokers could be liable for the agent's theft under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c02s48-2-122ol1g" target="_self">48-2-122(g)</a></cite> (now T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c01s48-1-122ol1g" target="_self">48-1-122(g)</a></cite>) even though the brokers only controlled the agent indirectly.

        Two-year statute of limitations in this section rather than three-year statute of limitations for Tennessee common-law fraud and deceit claims applies to claims under Rule 10b-5 of the securities and exchange commission. Ockerman v. May Zima & Co., 694 F. Supp. 414, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15329, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18368 (M.D. Tenn. 1988).

        Federal securities claims are subject to the statute of limitations applicable to actions under Tennessee's Blue Sky laws, and not to the statute of limitations applicable to Tennessee common law fraud and deceit claims.

        In a securities and exchange commission Rule 10b-5 action, federal courts in this state should borrow the three-year statute of limitations governing actions for common-law fraud. Nichols v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 706 F. Supp. 1309, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1182 (M.D. Tenn. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tennessee Securities Act of 1980 with its two-year statute of repose, subsection (h) of this section, is the most analogous statute to SEC Rule 10b-5, codified in 17 CFR 240.10b-5, and thus this section, and not T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-105" target="_blank">28-3-105</a></cite>, the three-year statute of limitations for common law fraud, applies to 10b-5 cases in Tennessee.

       <p>
        Investors' claims to recover monetary damages against investment firm are based solely on common law breach of fiduciary duty and do not fall within the ambit of subsection (h) of this section. Instead, breach of fiduciary duty claims are quasi-contractual in nature and the applicable statute of limitations is six years pursuant to T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.tn.tca.title.28.html#t28c03s28-3-109ol1a3" target="_blank">28-3-109(a)(3)</a></cite>.

        Where a seller gave repeated assurances to purchasers of unregistered securities that civil claims were being filed on their behalf and persuaded the purchasers not to file individual actions, equitable estoppel was properly applied to allow amendment of a complaint in order to add a cause of action under the Tennessee Securities Act.

       “(c)  All effective registrations under prior law, all administrative orders relating to such registrations, and all conditions imposed upon such registrations remain in effect so long as they would have remained in effect if this Act had not been passed. They are considered to have been filed, entered, or imposed under this Act, but are governed by prior law.
      </p>

       “(d)  Prior law applies in respect of any sale made within one year after the effective date of this Act pursuant to an offering exempt under prior law which offering was begun in good faith before such effective date.

      <p>
       “(e)  Judicial review of all administrative orders as to which review proceedings have not been instituted by the effective date of this Act are governed by Section 20, except that no review proceeding may be instituted unless the petition is filed within any period of limitation which applied to a review proceeding when the order was entered and in any event within 60 days after the effective date of this Act.”

         While the Tennessee Court of Appeals addressed the concept of reverse piercing in the corporation/shareholder context, it never adopted it, and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c11s48-11-201" target="_self">48-11-201</a></cite> defined a subsidiary as a corporation more than 50 percent of whose outstanding voting shares were owned by its parent and/or the parent's other wholly-owned subsidiaries. However, the alleged parent, the insurance agency, never owned any shares of the company, and therefore, because the company was not a subsidiary of the insurance agency, the plaintiff's reverse piercing claim failed.

       The statutory requirements for the completion of the organization of a corporation were mandatory, and, unless they were all substantially done, the charter was void and the incorporation was incomplete. Collier v. Union R. Co., 113 Tenn. 96, 83 S.W. 155, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 9 (1904).

       Evidence of user under a legislative charter was prima facie evidence that the conditions which the charter required to be performed, precedent to the time that the corporation was to go into operation, had been performed. Williams v. Union Bank, 21 Tenn. 339, 1841 Tenn. LEXIS 14 (1841); Gleaves v. Brick Church Tpk. Co., 33 Tenn. 491, 1853 Tenn. LEXIS 78 (1853); Merriman v. Magiveny, 59 Tenn. 494, 1873 Tenn.

       Where a corporation had been organized and existed under a general statute, its existence could not be proved by parol evidence, if objected to, but must be proved by the production of the charter, or a certified copy thereof. Trice v. State, 39 Tenn. 591, 1859 Tenn. LEXIS 284 (1859); Bond v. State, 129 Tenn. 75, 165 S.W. 229, 1913 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1913).

       Where proof of the charter of a corporation of another state is required, it must be by the production of the charter, or an authenticated copy thereof, or the statute granting the charter, or a book purporting to be the public statute book of the state, in which the charter is printed. Jones v. State, 37 Tenn. 346, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 12 (1858); Owen v. State, 37 Tenn. 493, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 46 (1858); Augusta Mfg. Co. v. Vertrees, 72 Tenn. 75, 1879 Tenn.

       The legality or validity of the charter of a de facto corporation was a question for the state, to be raised by a proceeding in the nature of a quo warranto or similar proceeding, and could not ordinarily be made in a collateral proceeding. La Grange &amp; M. R. R. Co. v. Rainey, 47 Tenn. 420, 1870 Tenn. LEXIS 163 (1870); Merriman v. Magiveny, 59 Tenn. 494, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 98 (1873); State v. Butler, 83 Tenn. 104, 1885 Tenn.

      </p>
      <p>
       Only the state, by proceedings in the nature of quo warranto, can attack the validity of a de facto corporation. Lee v. Harrison, 196 Tenn. 603, 270 S.W.2d 173, 1954 Tenn. LEXIS 427 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the state can raise the question of corporate existence. Springfield Tobacco Redryers Corp. v. Springfield, 41 Tenn. App. 254, 293 S.W.2d 189, 1956 Tenn. App. LEXIS 166 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of former section precluding attack upon a defectively organized corporation did not apply to a situation wherein the termination of forfeiture of the charter of a properly organized corporation was involved.

       The stipulation in a contract of subscription to the original capital stock of a manufacturing corporation was without consideration, ultra vires, and void, where it provided that the subscriber should receive, upon consideration of the subscription, the bonds of the corporation to the full amount of the subscription, secured by a first mortgage “upon the company's plant,” in addition to the subscriber's stock for the like amount; the corporation might repudiate such illegal stipulation, without releasing the subscriber from liability for the subscription, or subjecting itself to an action by the subscriber. Such stipulation was regarded as an independent covenant, and not a condition precedent to the payment of the subscription. Morrow v.

       Foreign corporation was subject to process served upon the secretary of state under the former section in a civil suit for personal injuries from a defect in its product, where it had agents in the state selling to distributors and consumers, settling claims, servicing delinquent accounts, briefing product's use and investigating uses, since it was substantially carrying on a business.

       If a foreign corporation which has no physical facilities in this state has not designated an agent upon whom process against it may be served but has made use of the privilege extended by law to foreign corporations to do business within Tennessee after proper domestication, it is deemed to have constituted Tennessee secretary of state its agent for the service of process in actions arising out of unauthorized business done by it within Tennessee; however, any such transactions complained of must have arisen in this state and attendant circumstances localized its activities and evidenced its “presence” in some sense.

       Substituted service of process through Tennessee secretary of state was properly had on a foreign corporation in action against the corporation for injuries sustained by the buyer of an allegedly defective second-hand wheel balancer manufactured by the corporation, the corporation having sold the balancer to a Tennessee jobber and supplied a representative who conducted meetings with the jobber's salesmen and supervised installation of any such equipment, as such activity constituted “doing business” in Tennessee. Trussell v. Bear Mfg. Co., 215 F. Supp. 802, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6381 (E.D. Tenn. 1963).

      <p>
       Defendant foreign corporation was “doing business within” Tennessee by transacting in a continuous manner a substantial part of its ordinary business, and must be deemed to have constituted the Tennessee secretary of state its agent to receive process in a civil action arising from unauthorized business, wherein the buyer of a defective second-hand wheel balancer, manufactured by corporation, brought action for injury; sale of the balancer and other equipment to Tennessee jobber and sending a representative to meet with jobber's salesmen and supervise installation of the equipment constituted “doing business.” Trussell v.

       Where uncontroverted affidavits as well as deposition of the plaintiff established that no new facts had been developed with respect to defendant doing business in Tennessee since dismissal of former action on ground that defendant was not doing business in Tennessee so as to be subject to service of process, action would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

         When a creditor pierced the corporate veil of a debtor's company to hold the debtor personally liable for debts to the creditor, the creditor could not hold other shareholders of the company personally liable on the theory that the other shareholders were liable once the corporate veil was pierced because: (1) T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c16s48-16-203ol1b" target="_self">48-16-203(b)</a></cite> directly contradicted the creditor's assertion by providing that a shareholder of a corporation was not personally liable for the acts or debts of the corporation except that the shareholder could become personally liable by reason of the shareholder's own acts or conduct, (2) No evidence supported the creditor's assertion that the other shareholders were apprised of, and acquiesced in, the debtor's use of the company's funds for personal reasons in disregard of the company's corporate form, and (3) The other shareholders'  boilerplate acknowledgments that the other shareholders ratified the acts of the company's officers were insufficient to hold the other shareholders personally liable.

         The right of an assignee under a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors to recover unpaid subscription for stock was not defeated by the fact that, with the assignee's permission given upon the execution of an indemnity bond, the stockholders other than such defaulting stockholder reorganized the corporation and resumed business with the machinery assigned to the assignee, after compromising some of the debts and acquiring assets sufficient to pay the others, with money borrowed and raised by issuing and selling preferred stock.

American Nat'l Bank v. Tinsley Millinery Co., 20 Tenn. App. 459, 100 S.W.2d 665, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 37 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

        </h4>
        <p>
         In the absence of express power conferred by statute, no power existed in the corporation, its officers, or directory to release a stockholder from payment of a stock subscription, after the stockholder's liability had become fixed. Such release could be effected alone by the consent of all the stockholders, where the rights of creditors were not involved. Chase v. E. T., V. &amp; G. R.R. Co., 73 Tenn. 415, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 153 (1880); Cartwright v. Dickinson, 88 Tenn. 476, 12 S.W. 1030, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 17 Am. St. Rep. 910, <cite class="lra">7 L.R.A. 706</cite> (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         A stockholder was not released, in law or equity, from liability for the stockholder's unpaid subscription where, on account of the stockholder's own or the stockholder's agent's mistake of law or fact, the stockholder supposed the contract of subscription had been properly canceled, and for that reason ceased to act as a stockholder in the corporation, which became insolvent through its subsequent management, in which the stockholder did not participate. Cartwright v. Dickinson, 88 Tenn. 476, 12 S.W. 1030, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 17 Am. St. Rep. 910, <cite class="lra">7 L.R.A. 706</cite> (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where an officer of a corporation assumed responsibility to obtain a release or cancellation of the stockholder's contract of subscription, the officer became the agent of the stockholder. Cartwright v. Dickinson, 88 Tenn. 476, 12 S.W. 1030, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 17 Am. St. Rep. 910, <cite class="lra">7 L.R.A. 706</cite> (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         The unauthorized release by the action of the corporation or its officers was not made effectual by reason of their having procured new and additional subscriptions and contribution of new capital to take the place of that released. It was wholly immaterial whether the new and additional subscriptions and contributions of capital were void or valid. Cartwright v. Dickinson, 88 Tenn. 476, 12 S.W. 1030, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 17 Am. St. Rep. 910, <cite class="lra">7 L.R.A. 706</cite> (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         If a corporation undertook by way of reduction of its capital stock to retire a part of its shares and to release subscribers therefor on unpaid parts of their subscriptions, such was ineffectual as to creditors in existence at the time of the reduction. Grigsby v. Ainsworth, 13 Tenn. App. 372, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 145 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cancellation of subscription after the corporation became insolvent was void as to creditors, and the subscriber remained liable. Hamby v. Fouche, 15 Tenn. App. 248, — S.W.2d —, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 92 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the bill by a receiver set up an attempt to cancel a subscription and defendant denied the allegations of the bill generally, the latter could not urge the cancellation as an affirmative defense. Hamby v. Fouche, 15 Tenn. App. 248, — S.W.2d —, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 92 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).
        </p>
        <p>
         The holders of unpaid corporate stock cannot defeat recovery on their subscriptions for the stock, by surrendering it to the corporation for cancellation at the suggestion of a creditor, pursuant to a resolution passed by the holders of unpaid stock, without notice to the holders of paid-up stock, since it requires the consent of all stockholders, where there are no rights of intervening creditors, to release the holders of unpaid stock from liability thereon. American Nat'l Bank v. Tinsley Millinery Co., 20 Tenn. App. 459, 100 S.W.2d 665, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 37 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).
        </p>
        <p>
         Unpaid subscriptions for corporate stock, like any other asset of the corporation, when it becomes insolvent, may be collected through the interposition of a court of equity, and, if the corporation has secretly agreed not to require payment, or if it has released the subscribers without consideration, the agreement or release may be held void as against creditors on the ground of fraud. American Nat'l Bank v. Tinsley Millinery Co., 20 Tenn. App. 459, 100 S.W.2d 665, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 37 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1936).

        </h4>
        <p>
         The fact that a corporation had violated its charter by taking stock subscriptions in excess of its authorized and fixed capital stock, or by other illegal acts, constituted no defense to its suit to recover from a subscriber the amount of the subscriber's unpaid subscription which was legal and valid because taken before the fixed capital stock was exceeded. Cartwright v. Dickinson, 88 Tenn. 476, 12 S.W. 1030, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 68, 17 Am. St. Rep. 910, <cite class="lra">7 L.R.A. 706</cite> (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         The subscribers were not estopped to resist the collection of their subscriptions by the fact that they might have become directors, or attended the meetings of the directors or stockholders, if they did not participate or acquiesce in the illegal acts of the corporation, but promptly repudiated such after notice. Newport Cotton-Mill Co. v. Mims, 103 Tenn. 465, 53 S.W. 736, 1899 Tenn. LEXIS 128 (1899).
        </p>
        <p>
         The subscriber upon increased capitalization, when sued on the subscriber's notes issued under the subscriber's contract of subscription, should not be permitted to set up as a defense the want of a legal organization, or the invalidity of the amendment to the charter increasing the amount of the capitalization, on the ground that the witness to the signature of the corporators on their application for the amendment to the charter was incompetent. Pope v. Merchants' Trust Co., 118 Tenn. 506, 103 S.W. 792, 1907 Tenn. LEXIS 60 (1907).
        </p>
        <p>
         One whose subscription was obtained by fraud must show diligence in discovering the fraud and repudiating the subscription contract, as against creditors of the corporation. One year of delay and payment of one assessment operated to defeat the defense. Heiskell v. Morris, 135 Tenn. 238, 186 S.W. 99, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 24 (1916).
        </p>
        <p>
         That a corporation purchased realty at an excessive price was not a defense by a stockholder to an action to recover on his subscription. Planters' Warehouse Co. v. Sentelle, 148 Tenn. 353, 255 S.W. 589, 1923 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1923).

         In adjusting liabilities of stockholders in insolvent bank, actual payments on stock would bear interest from date on which made. Those who paid in notes of the bank would only be allowed the amount actually paid for such notes. Moses v. Ocoee Bank, 69 Tenn. 398, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1878).
        </p>
        <p>
         The receiver, suing to recover balance due on stock subscription, might recover interest thereon from the date of the subscription, although the subscriber was not liable for interest on the subscriber's individual, proportionate, or double liability beyond the par value of the stock, because such liability did not exist against the stockholder until the necessity for its collection arose.

         While all the stockholders in a domestic corporation, subscriptions of which have not been fully paid up, must be made parties to action by corporate receiver, so as to apportion the loss equitably among them, nevertheless, where stockholder in a foreign corporation was sued in this state, the relation of the stockholder being contractual and entered into in contemplation of the laws of the state of corporation, those laws govern, and the courts of Tennessee would enforce the remedy they provide against a single stockholder, insofar as that remedy was not penal. Sullivan v. Farnsworth, 132 Tenn. 691, 179 S.W. 317, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1915).
        </p>
        <p>
         In receiver's suits to collect subscriptions, all solvent delinquent stockholders within the jurisdiction should be made defendants, but the failure to do so may not operate as a defense by one properly sued, where question was not raised in limine. Hamby v. Fouche, 15 Tenn. App. 248, — S.W.2d —, 1932 Tenn. App. LEXIS 92 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1932).

         A debt which a stockholder had against the insolvent corporation could not be set off against a debt the stockholder owed for unpaid stock to the receiver of the corporation representing all creditors.

        <p>
         The filing of an answer by a corporation to a general creditors' bill, admitting that the corporation was hopelessly insolvent and was not a going concern, waived objection to the maintenance of the creditors' bill, thereby precluding the holders of unpaid stock from thereafter objecting thereto.

         On December 31, 2001, the employee performed his obligations under the agreement, but the corporation never issued stock certificates evincing his ownership of shares; as a transfer of stock did not require issuance or delivery of a stock certificate to be valid, the court invoked equity to determine that the issuance and delivery of stock certificates to the employee was considered as having been done, and thus he was vested with ownership of the shares on December 31, 2001.

           Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (c) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are to be made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness referred to in the preceding sentence is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.

           A dividend on particular shares belonged to the person who owned the shares on date of its declaration, which segregated the dividend from the general assets, as between vendor and vendee of the shares.

           A dividend on particular shares belonged to the person who owned the shares on date of its declaration notwithstanding the fact that the resolution of declaration provided that payment to stockholders should be at a later date on order of the directory.

           Where there was a binding contract to sell shares, payment of purchase price deferred, and there was a dividend declared between the time of the making of the contract and the delivery of the certificate, the dividend belonged in equity to the purchaser.

           All jurisdictions impose threshold preconditions on derivative suits, the most common precondition requiring the shareholder to first make a written demand on the corporation's directors requesting them to prosecute the suit or to take other suitable corrective action, commonly known as the “demand requirement.” Preconditions such as demand allow the directors to occupy their normal status as the conductors of the corporation's affairs, encourage informal resolution of intracorporate disputes, guard against misuse of the derivative remedy. Lewis on behalf of Citizens Sav. Bank & Trust Co. v. Boyd, 838 S.W.2d 215, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 471 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
          </p>
          <p>
           Courts in some jurisdictions like Tennessee that do not require a precomplaint demand in every case have segregated derivative actions into two categories. “Demand refused” cases are those in which the corporation's directors have refused to take action in response to a shareholder's demand. “Demand excused” cases are those in which a shareholder is not required to make a demand because doing so would be futile. Lewis on behalf of Citizens Sav. Bank & Trust Co. v. Boyd, 838 S.W.2d 215, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 471 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
          </p>
          <p>
           Tennessee's futility exception to the demand requirement for derivative actions does not apply to foreign corporations, because their governance is determined by the laws of the state of incorporation; therefore, a trial court did not err by dismissing a derivative action for failure to make a pre-suit demand on a Utah corporation, because such a demand was required under Utah law. Hicks v. Lewis, 148 S.W.3d 80, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 718 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), appeal denied, — S.W.3d —, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 318 (Tenn. Apr. 5, 2004).

           Proper demand-futility standard is version of two-pronged Aronson test. Lukas v. McPeak, 730 F.3d 635, 2013 FED App. 280P, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 19295 (6th Cir. Sept. 19, 2013).
          </p>
          <p>
           Shareholder failed to meet demand-futility standard because shareholder failed to demonstrate majority of board was interested and not independent; at best, allegations made out that one board member's disinterest and independence may have been compromised, but did not allege any specifics regarding other board members. Lukas v. McPeak, 730 F.3d 635, 2013 FED App. 280P, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 19295 (6th Cir. Sept. 19, 2013).

           The party seeking dismissal of a derivative suit based on a special litigation committee's recommendation has the burden of satisfying the court of the committee's independence, good faith, and procedural fairness, as well as the soundness of the committee's conclusions and recommendations. Lewis on behalf of Citizens Sav. Bank & Trust Co. v. Boyd, 838 S.W.2d 215, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 471 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).

The reviewing court is not to substitute its own business judgment for the committee's but should critically evaluate the special litigation committee's findings and recommendations, to determine whether they were made in good faith, whether they are supported by the record of the investigation, and whether they are consistent with the corporation's best interests as articulated in the special committee's report.

           Although a grandchild did not own a nursery's stock at the time of alleged wrongs, a trial court erred in dismissing the grandchild's stockholder's derivative action because the grandchild acquired the stock by operation of law from a predecessor who was a stockholder at the time of the acts; thus, the grandchild had standing to maintain the action under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c17s48-17-401" target="_self">48-17-401</a></cite>.

           When it should have been obvious to the plaintiff at the outset that someone with a primary interest in protecting the plaintiff's debentures, rather than protecting the plaintiff's stock, could not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the other shareholders, the action was brought without reasonable cause.

         Although the rules of the corporation required the directors to have regular meetings, they might have special or informal meetings whenever the interest of the corporation required it, because this was a necessary power incident to the faithful discharge of their trust; and if recorded as part of their official action, such meetings were legal and binding.

         Though there be no formal meeting of directorate and no minutes of their action, the unanimous agreement or act of the number of directors requisite to form a quorum might bind the corporation to increase of salaries, when such directors were practically the sole owners of the corporate stock.

          Statute imposed a duty that ran to the corporation, in favor of the corporation and its stockholders; it was not intended to establish a statutory privity between directors and officers and third parties not representing the corporate entity.

         <p>
          The directors occupied a fiduciary relation toward the stockholders, and were bound to good faith and reasonable diligence in the performance of their duties; they were not express trustees, and were trustees only in the sense in which every agent is a trustee for the agent's principal, but they were bound to exercise diligence and good faith to all the parties interested in the affairs of the corporation; they must also use care, attention, circumspection in the affairs of the corporation, and particularly in the safekeeping and disbursement of the funds committed to their control; they must see that these funds are appropriated as intended to the purposes of the trust, and if they misappropriate them, or allow others to divert them from these purposes, they must answer individually for it. Ignorance would not excuse them when they had the means of knowledge. Shea v. Mabry, 69 Tenn. 319, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 94 (1878); Vance v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 72 Tenn. 385, 1880 Tenn.

          Where the makers of a note described themselves in the body as “the directors” of a certain corporation, the note was the individual obligation of the parties signing it, and was not the agreement of the corporation. Gregory v. Bohannon, 3 Shan. 479 (1875).

         <p>
          Directors were primarily liable to the corporation both for nonfeasance and misfeasance, but they might, in equity, be proceeded against by stockholders or creditors in proper cases, who would be subrogated to the rights of the corporation; such liability was an asset of the corporation, and passed to the assignee under a general assignment for the benefit of creditors. Shea v. Knoxville & K. R. Co., 65 Tenn. 277, 1873 Tenn. LEXIS 345 (1873); Moses v. Ocoee Bank, 69 Tenn. 398, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 110 (1878); Hume v. Commercial Bank, 77 Tenn. 728, 1882 Tenn.

          Statutory liability of directors for creating excessive debts was not an asset of the corporation, but was one inuring directly and exclusively to the benefit of particular creditors whose debts were excessively created; and such liability could be enforced only by a general creditor's bill, and not by a suit prosecuted by the receiver of the corporation. A suit to enforce such liability could not be maintained by a few, less than all, of the creditors of the corporation entitled to hold the directors so liable, but the suit must be brought by all, or by some on behalf of all, of the creditors for whose debts the directors had so rendered themselves individually liable. Moulton v. Connell-Hall-McLester Co., 93 Tenn. 377, 27 S.W. 672, 1893 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1894); Tradesman Pub. Co. v. Knoxville Car-Wheel Co., 95 Tenn. 634, 32 S.W. 1097, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 140, 49 Am.

          A director was not liable to creditors for profits earned by way of use of a plant which the director had leased from the corporation as an idle plant after the failure of the corporation, the director paying a maximum rental therefor.

          Where directors, acting as individuals, sold, in good faith, and on advice of counsel, to the corporation capital stock for the purpose of retiring the stock at a time when the corporation was in a prosperous condition and there was no reason to anticipate its subsequent financial collapse, due to economic conditions, they were not liable to stockholders for the purchase price of the stock to stockholders who: (1) participated in the transaction; (2) who for any appreciable length of time before a receiver was appointed knew of the transaction; or (3) who, subsequent to the transaction, purchased their stock from one with knowledge of the transaction.

           Where it was claimed that the president of a land company (a corporation) in selling its stock agreed that the corporation would buy it back in event the purchaser became dissatisfied and surrendered the shares, there was lack of power in such officer to bind the corporation to repurchase.

           A deed of trust purporting to be that of a corporation and to convey its property is sufficient though signed by “M.L.B., president of K.L. Company.” Its validity was not affected by failure of the instrument to recite authority for the official to borrow money for the security of which it was executed. Where the money was received by the corporation, authority was presumed in favor of the lender secured thereby. Turner v. Kingston Lumber & Mfg. Co., 59 S.W. 410, 1900 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 93 (1900).

             On January 1, 1988, the former limitation of six years was shortened to one year, and plaintiffs in action accruing before 1988 had one year after January 1, 1988, within which to sue, their suit not being barred by the former six year statute.

        <p>
         An amendment to the charter filed before the corporation came into existence prevented the corporation as originally contemplated from coming into existence, so that subscriptions taken on the basis of the original charter never became binding. Wallace v. Duel, 18 Tenn. App. 483, 79 S.W.2d 595, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 50 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
        </p>
        <p>
         An attempt by incorporators to change the original charter without the consent of a subscriber, after the subscription had been made, worked a change in the subscription contract, and a subsequent perfection of the amended charter did not act as an acceptance of the original offer of the subscriber, binding the subscriber to the new terms resulting from the amendment. Wallace v. Duel, 18 Tenn. App. 483, 79 S.W.2d 595, 1934 Tenn. App. LEXIS 50 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1934).
        </p>
        <p>
         The failure of a subscriber to capital stock of a proposed corporation, upon notice given by the promoters, to attend a so-called meeting of the stockholders, the object of which was to amend the corporate charter, would not justify anyone in relying upon the subscriber's subscription as an estoppel, nor as a waiver of the subscriber's rights as they then existed.

        An amendment to the charter does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than shareholders of the corporation. An amendment changing a corporation's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name.

        Tennessee overrules Blasingame v. American Materials, Inc., 654 S.W.2d 659 (Tenn. 1983), to the extent that it implicitly mandates use of the Delaware Block method for determining the fair value of a dissenting shareholder's stock. Tennessee adopts the approach espoused in Weinberger, in which trial courts are permitted to determine fair value by using any technique or method that is generally acceptable in the financial community and admissible in court, including valuation methods that incorporate projections of future value. Athlon Sports Communs., Inc. v. Duggan, 549 S.W.3d 107, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (Tenn. June 8, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of Tennessee found that trial courts were not required to use the Delaware Block method to determine the fair value of a dissenting shareholder's stock. Because the court could not determine whether a trial court's evaluation of the evidence was affected by its perception that Tennessee case law mandated the use of the Delaware Block valuation method, the court vacated the trial court's order and remanded the case for reconsideration of the valuation of the dissenting shareholders'  shares. Athlon Sports Communs., Inc. v. Duggan, 549 S.W.3d 107, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (Tenn. June 8, 2018).

         Corporation waived the requirement of written notice of dissent because although the dissenters failed to adhere to the letter of the statute, the corporation knew of their intention to dissent and proceeded exactly as though they had complied with the statute; the corporation even filed suit requesting a judicial determination of the fair value of the dissenters shares, and thus, it suffered absolutely no prejudice as a result of their failure to provide written notice.

          Supreme Court of Tennessee found that trial courts were not required to use the Delaware Block method to determine the fair value of a dissenting shareholder's stock. Because the court could not determine whether a trial court's evaluation of the evidence was affected by its perception that Tennessee case law mandated the use of the Delaware Block valuation method, the court vacated the trial court's order and remanded the case for reconsideration of the valuation of the dissenting shareholders'  shares. Athlon Sports Communs., Inc. v. Duggan, 549 S.W.3d 107, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (Tenn. June 8, 2018).

          Tennessee overrules Blasingame v. American Materials, Inc., 654 S.W.2d 659 (Tenn. 1983), to the extent that it implicitly mandates use of the Delaware Block method for determining the fair value of a dissenting shareholder's stock. Tennessee adopts the approach espoused in Weinberger, in which trial courts are permitted to determine fair value by using any technique or method that is generally acceptable in the financial community and admissible in court, including valuation methods that incorporate projections of future value. Athlon Sports Communs., Inc. v. Duggan, 549 S.W.3d 107, 2018 Tenn. LEXIS 310 (Tenn. June 8, 2018).

          The receiver of a corporation cannot recover collateral pledged by it while a going concern though at the time the pledge was made the corporation was actually insolvent. Where assets are pledged under authority of stockholders by officers who executed renewal notes which repledged the collateral, a receiver later appointed may not attack validity of the pledge. Fact that finance committee did not authorize pledge until after creditors' bill was filed did not affect validity of pledge. Julian v. American Nat'l Bank, 21 Tenn.

        The penalty was applicable only where the noncomplying corporation transacted, or intended to transact within this state some substantial portion of its ordinary business, continuous in character as distinguished from casual or occasional transactions. The intention to continue business in this state might be inferred from a single transaction, but a single transaction unaccompanied by any other evidence to so continue did not suffice to penalize.

        Foreign corporations could not be prevented by state legislation from doing interstate commerce business within the limits of the state and they might, without complying with state laws for their domestication, do such business in this state; but they could not, without so complying with state laws, acquire a domicile or establish a place of business in this state.

        A foreign corporation, with no warehouse, office, or domicile in Tennessee, but doing an interstate commerce business through a commission broker in Tennessee, who sold for all who sought the broker's services, was not “doing business” in Tennessee, within the meaning of the statutes regulating foreign corporations.

If the court determines that a proposed discontinuance or settlement will substantially affect the interest of the corporation's members or a class of members, the court shall direct that notice be given the members affected. If notice is so directed to be given, the court may determine which party or parties to the suit shall bear the expense of giving such notice, in such proportion as the court finds to be reasonable in the circumstances, and the amount of such expense shall be awarded as special costs of the suit and recoverable in the same manner as other taxable costs.

           In a dispute between homeowners and a developer, it was error for a trial court to order the developer from violating the tax limitations of the developer's charter because the homeowners had no standing to allege a violation. Hughes v. New Life Dev. Corp., 387 S.W.3d 453, 2012 Tenn. LEXIS 819 (Tenn. Nov. 19, 2012).

          <p>
           Chancery court properly granted summary judgment to an intervening nonprofit organization and its directors and dismissed all of the members'  claims because the members lacked standing inasmuch as they could not fairly and adequately represent the interest of the organization's remaining members where they voluntarily surrendered their memberships in the organization according to the organization's constitution, and exhibited an overriding antagonistic relationship between the members and the organization, and the trial court allowed the members a reasonable opportunity to engage in discovery related to the issue of standing both before and after the organization intervened in the case.

             Directors of a homeowners association were entitled to summary judgment on homeowners'  claims of breach of fiduciary duty because the homeowners'  bare assertions failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the directors'  conduct of the association's affairs amounted to willful, wanton, or gross negligence. Moreover, the association was, therefore, also entitled to summary judgment on the homeowners'  claim as the homeowners asserted no claim against the association apart from those claims asserted against the directors.

           “Charitable purposes” and “noncharitable purposes” are not defined in the Charitable Solicitations Act. However, given the context in which those terms are used, “charitable purposes” would include activities in substantial furtherance of the benevolent, educational, voluntary health, philanthropic, humane, patriotic, religious, and eleemosynary work of a charitable organization. Whether lobbying at any governmental level or in any particular “amount” constitutes a “charitable purpose” or a “noncharitable purpose” within the meaning of the Act will depend on the particular facts and circumstances involved in any given instance. An “action organization” may or may not be a charitable organization, depending on the particular facts and circumstances in any given instance.   Attempting to influence legislation and advocating or campaigning for objectives that may only be attained via the legislative process may or may not constitute a charitable purpose depending on the particular facts and circumstances involved in any given instance. Participating or intervening in any political campaign in support of or in opposition to any candidate for public office does not constitute a charitable purpose.  OAG 16-41, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 41 (12/6/2016).

           Attorney General Opinions. “Charitable purposes” and “noncharitable purposes” are not defined in the Charitable Solicitations Act.  However, given the context in which those terms are used, “charitable purposes” would include activities in substantial furtherance of the benevolent, educational, voluntary health, philanthropic, humane, patriotic, religious, and eleemosynary work of a charitable organization. Whether lobbying at any governmental level or in any particular “amount” constitutes a “charitable purpose” or a “noncharitable purpose” within the meaning of the Act will depend on the particular facts and circumstances involved in any given instance. An “action organization” may or may not be a charitable organization, depending on the particular facts and circumstances in any given instance. Attempting to influence legislation and advocating or campaigning for objectives that may only be attained via the legislative process may or may not constitute a charitable purpose depending on the particular facts and circumstances involved in any given instance. Participating or intervening in any political campaign in support of or in opposition to any candidate for public office does not constitute a charitable purpose. OAG 16-41, 2016 Tenn. AG LEXIS 41 (12/6/2016).

Damages are the excess of either the value of the security on the date of purchase or its present value, whichever is greater, over the present value of the consideration received for the security. Tender requires only notice of willingness to pay the amount specified in exchange for the security.

Subject to subsection (c), if a delayed effective date is specified in the manner permitted by § 48-205-101(8), the LLC is formed and its existence begins at a future specific date or on the occurrence of a future specific event, neither one of which shall be or occur more than ninety (90) days from the initial filing of the articles.

If a certificate of formation is not filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of initial filing of the articles, the presumed effective date of the formation shall be on the ninetieth day following the date of filing of the articles. The presumption, however, can be rebutted.

       Terms and Conditions.  The terms and conditions of a conversion of a general or limited partnership to an LLC must, in the case of a general partnership, be approved by all the partners or by a number or percentage specified for conversion in the partnership agreement or, in the case of a limited partnership, by all of the partners, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the limited partnership agreement, unless such limited partnership was formed after December 31, 1993, and the original agreement of limited partnership provided for a conversion or a procedure of conversion of the limited partnership to an LLC without the consent of all partners, in which case the approval or procedure under the original limited partnership agreement shall be sufficient.

      <li id="t48c204s48-204-101ol1c">
       Filing.  After the conversion is approved under subsection (b), the general or limited partnership shall file articles of conversion with the office of the secretary of state which satisfy the requirements of § 48-205-101 and also shall include:

        <li id="t48c204s48-204-101ol1c1">

       Effective Date.  In the case of a general partnership, the conversion takes effect when the articles of conversion are filed with the secretary of state or at any later date on or before ninety (90) days from filing of the articles of conversion if specified in such articles. The same presumptions that apply to the filing of the articles under chapter 203 of this title apply to the filing of the articles of conversion. In the case of a limited partnership, the filing of the articles of conversion with the office of the secretary of state, in compliance with this section, shall constitute and, for purposes of title 61, chapter 2, be deemed to be a certificate of cancellation of the limited partnership. In the case of a limited partnership formed under Tennessee law prior to January 1, 1989, that has not elected to be governed by title 61, chapter 2, as amended, a copy of the articles of conversion shall be filed in the register of deeds office in the county in which the certificate of limited partnership of the limited partnership was filed; provided, that the failure to make such filing shall not prevent the conversion from becoming effective as provided in this subsection (d). The register of deeds may charge five dollars ($5.00) plus fifty cents (50¢) per page in excess of five (5) pages for such filing.

The former general partner's liability for all other obligations and liabilities of the LLC incurred after the conversion takes effect is that of a member as provided in chapters 201-248 of this title.

       Transaction of Business Outside Tennessee.  By enacting chapters 201-248 of this title the general assembly recognizes the LLC as an important and constructive form of business organization. The general assembly understands that:

         For businesses organized under chapters 201-248 of this title to function effectively and for such chapters to be a useful enactment, such chapters must be accorded the same comity and full faith and credit that states typically accord to each other's corporate laws; and

       Except with respect to dissolution avoidance consent, the board of governors, for a board-governed LLC, or the chief manager, for a member-managed LLC, may, acting on such board's or person's own initiative, make a proposal to the members to take an action without a meeting. All members entitled to vote shall be given written notice of such proposal. Such notice shall require a written response within a specified time but not less than thirty (30) days from the effective date of the notice and shall contain the recommendation of the board of governors or the chief manager. The failure of a member to respond within the time specified in the notice shall constitute a vote in favor of the recommendation of the board of governors or chief manager, as the case may be. The notice shall contain a statement concerning the voting effect of the failure of a member to timely respond to the proposal. Except as provided in subsection (b), if the voting power of the members responding in favor of the recommendation as to the proposal, combined with the voting power of the members failing to respond, is equal to the voting power that would be required to take the same action at a meeting of the members at which all members are present, then such proposal shall become the action of the members of the LLC effective as of the expiration of the notice period.

If a member or a party to a contribution agreement does not make the required contribution of property or services, such person is obligated at the option of the LLC to contribute cash equal to that portion of the value of such contribution that has not been made.

Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of an LLC who extends credit after the filing of articles or execution of an operating agreement or an amendment thereto which, in either case, reflects the obligation, and before the amendment thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reasonably relied on the obligation of a member or party to a contribution agreement to make a contribution. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution to an LLC may not be enforced unless the conditions to the obligation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of the members of an LLC or the board of governors, if applicable, prior to the time the call occurs.

       Definition and Scope.  A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the LLC in which a governor, manager or non-governor member of a special litigation committee of the LLC has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the LLC solely because of the governor's or manager's interest in the transaction if any one (1) of the following is true:
       <ol>
        <li id="t48c239s48-239-116ol1a1">
         The material facts of the transaction and the governor's or manager's interest were disclosed or known to the board of governors or a committee of the board of governors and the board of governors or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;

        <li id="t48c239s48-239-116ol1a2">
         The material facts of the transaction and governor's or manager's interest were disclosed or known to the members entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;

         The transaction was fair to the LLC; or
        </li>
        <li id="t48c239s48-239-116ol1a4">
         The transaction was of a nature in which the conflict of interest is waived by the articles or operating agreement. Such waiver shall be upheld unless manifestly unreasonable under the circumstances.

         Another entity in which the governor or manager has a material financial interest or in which the governor or manager is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or

If a majority of the governors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a governor with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subdivision (a)(1) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection.

       Authorization, Approval and Ratification Under Subdivision (a)(2).  For purposes of subdivision (a)(2), a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the membership interests entitled to be counted under this subsection (d). Membership interests owned by or voted under the control of a governor or manager who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and membership interests owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subdivision (b)(1), may not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subdivision (a)(2). The vote of those membership interests, however, shall be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other provisions of chapters 201-248 of this title. A majority of the membership interests, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection (d) constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

        Because a limited liability company (LLC) was for all intents and purposes dissolved, the trial court did not err in apportioning the proceeds of the sale of the LLC's assets first to the only member who had made a capital contribution to the LLC, as suggested by the distribution terms contained in the LLC's operating agreement.

        Because a limited liability company formed by a debtor was an entity that was separate from the debtor under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c217s48-217-101ol1a1" target="_self">48-217-101(a)(1)</a></cite> and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c249s48-249-114ol1a1B" target="_self">48-249-114(a)(1)(B)</a></cite>, a creditor's failure to establish that the LLC's “corporate veil” was properly pierced resulted in a finding that the creditor, the owner of a state court judgment against the LLC, was not a “creditor” of debtors and thus lacked standing to assert nondischargeability claims against them under either <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 727</cite> or <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 523</cite>.

        Pursuant to T.R.A.P. 13(d), in parties'  employment dispute, the evidence did not support the trial court's piercing of the veil of the employer in order to hold the president personally liable for an employee's unpaid compensation under T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c217s48-217-101ol1a1" target="_self">48-217-101(a)(1)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c249s48-249-114ol1a1B" target="_self">48-249-114(a)(1)(B)</a></cite>, as the Allen factors did not weigh in favor of such piercing; there was no evidence to show that the president's control of the employer-limited liability company was used to commit fraud or wrong, to perpetuate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or a dishonest or unjust act in contravention of third parties'  rights.

         In a case in which two brothers formed a limited liability company (LLC) to own and lease a commercial property, the operating agreement did not bar the corporate opportunity claims because the LLC's operating agreement did not reference specific types or categories of activities that would be permissible and would not violate the fiduciary duty of loyalty; and, to the extent the older brother argued that the waiver of the fiduciary duty of loyalty extended to business ventures of every nature and description such a blanket waiver would not comply with the Tennessee Revised Limited Liability Company Act as waiver of fiduciary duties had to be clear and specific.

           Bankruptcy court granted a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024 that was filed by an owner of a Tennessee limited liability company (LLC) and a receiver for the LLC which asked the court to set aside an order it entered that dismissed the LLC's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, to the extent the order required the LLC's managing member to execute a quitclaim deed in favor of a creditor in lieu of foreclosure. Although the managing member had the power under T.C.A. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c249s48-249-401" target="_self">48-249-401</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c249s48-249-402" target="_self">48-249-402</a></cite> to place the LLC into bankruptcy, he breached his duty under T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t48c249s48-249-403" target="_self">48-249-403</a></cite> to act in good faith when he disregarded a provision in the LLC's articles of incorporation which required the consent of all the LLC's owners and committed fraud when he told the LLC's attorney that the only other owner knew about the bankruptcy and provided the LLC's attorney with the wrong address for the other owner so he would not learn about the bankruptcy.

           Bankruptcy court granted a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024 that was filed by an owner of a Tennessee limited liability company (LLC) and a receiver for the LLC which asked the court to set aside an order it entered that dismissed the LLC's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, to the extent the order required the LLC's managing member to execute a quitclaim deed in favor of a creditor in lieu of foreclosure.

            When the articles of termination have been filed with the secretary of state, the existence of the LLC is terminated, except that the termination of the LLC existence shall not take away or impair any remedy of or against the LLC or its members, directors, managers or officers for any right or claim existing, or any liability incurred, prior to such termination. Any such action or proceeding by or against the LLC may be prosecuted or defended by the LLC in its LLC name. The members, directors, managers or officers, as applicable, shall have the power to take such LLC or other action, as may be appropriate, to protect such remedy, right or claim.

             Trial court did not err in finding that distribution of the proceeds of the sale of a limited liability company (LLC) solely to the chief manager of the LLC was legal because the manager made the sole capital contribution to the LLC; there was absolutely no documentary evidence in the record to show that a member of the LLC made a capital contribution to the LLC.
