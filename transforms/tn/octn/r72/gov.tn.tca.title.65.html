     <p>
      On the petition of any interested person, the commission may issue a declaratory ruling with respect to the applicability to any person, property, or state of facts of any rule or statute enforceable by it or with respect to the meaning and scope of any order of the commission. A declaratory ruling, if issued after argument and stated to be binding, is binding between the commission and the petitioner on the state of facts alleged in the petition, unless it is altered or set aside by a court in a proper proceeding. Such rulings are subject to review in the chancery court of Davidson County in the manner provided in this chapter for the review of decisions in contested cases. The commission shall prescribe by rule the form for such petitions and the procedure for their submission, consideration, and disposition.

      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The validity of any rule of the commission may be determined upon petition for a declaratory judgment thereon addressed to the chancery court of Davidson County, when it appears that the rule, or its threatened application, interferes with or impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the petitioner. The commission shall be made a party to all such proceedings. Such declaratory judgment may be rendered whether or not the petitioner has first requested the commission to pass upon the validity of the rule in question. In passing on such rules, the court shall declare the rule invalid only if it finds that it violates constitutional provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of the commission or was adopted without compliance with the rulemaking procedures provided for in this chapter.

       A solar electricity generating facility that comes within the statutory definition of “public electric system” is prohibited from selling power in certain geographical territories.  Whether its property is “affected by and dedicated to public use” will depend on a variety of factors, specific to each case.  The fact that it provides power “directly and exclusively to owners and/or tenants located on the same or adjacent premises” is just one of many factors to be considered but is not alone determinative of whether or not its property is affected by and dedicated to public use.   If the owner of a solar electricity generating facility is a public electric system as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c34s65-34-102ol15" target="_self">65-34-102(5)</a></cite>, it would likewise be a public utility as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c04s65-4-101ol16A" target="_self">65-4-101(6)(A)</a></cite> unless it were to come within one of the many statutory exceptions detailed in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c04s65-4-101ol16Ai" target="_self">65-4-101(6)(A)(i)</a></cite> through (B)(ii).  OAG 17-25, 2017 Tenn.

       <p>
        Chancery court properly dismissed a public utility's complaint for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, while the utility had the right to provide water service, the gravamen of its complaint was to maintain its exclusive franchise by prohibiting a developer and a competitor from providing water service where the utility's averments were ostensibly an appeal of the PUC's refusal to issue a declaratory order—that the competitor was a “public utility” and was illegally operating without a certificate of public convenience—and the PUC lacked authority to grant certificates of public convenience or to eject a competitor from an exclusive service area.

         Chancery court properly dismissed a public utility's complaint for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, while the utility had the right to provide water service, the gravamen of its complaint was to maintain its exclusive franchise by prohibiting a developer and a competitor from providing water service where the utility's averments were ostensibly an appeal of the PUC's refusal to issue a declaratory order—that the competitor was a “public utility” and was illegally operating without a certificate of public convenience—and the PUC lacked authority to grant certificates of public convenience or to eject a competitor from an exclusive service area.

The commission shall have power, after a hearing involving the financial ability and good faith of the applicant, the necessity for additional service in the municipality or territory, and such other matters as it deems relevant, to issue a certificate of public necessity and convenience, or to refuse to issue the same or to issue it for the establishment or construction of a portion only of the contemplated plant, route, line, or system or extension thereof, or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by the certificate such terms and conditions as to time or otherwise as in its judgment the public convenience, necessity, and protection may require, and may forfeit such certificate after issuance, for noncompliance with its terms, or provide therein for an ipso facto forfeiture of the same for failure to exercise the rights granted within the time fixed by the commission; provided, that nothing in this part shall be construed as requiring such certificate for a municipally owned plant, project, or development.

        The Tennessee public utility commission has the power after hearing upon notice, by order in writing, to fix just and reasonable individual rates, joint rates, tolls, fares, charges or schedules thereof, as well as commutation, mileage, and other special rates which shall be imposed, observed, and followed thereafter by any public utility as defined in § 65-4-101, whenever the commission shall determine any existing individual rate, joint rate, toll, fare, charge, or schedule thereof or commutation, mileage, or other special rates to be unjust, unreasonable, excessive, insufficient, or unjustly discriminatory or preferential, howsoever the same may have heretofore been fixed or established. In fixing such rates, joint rates, tolls, fares, charges or schedules, or commutation, mileage or other special rates, the commission shall take into account the safety, adequacy and efficiency or lack thereof of the service or services furnished by the public utility.

        Notwithstanding any other state law, special rates and terms negotiated between public utilities that are telecommunications providers and business customers shall not constitute price discrimination. Such rates and terms shall be presumed valid. The presumption of validity of such special rates and terms shall not be set aside except by complaint or by action of the Tennessee public utility commission commissioners, which Tennessee public utility commission action or complaint is supported by substantial evidence showing that such rates and terms violate applicable legal requirements other than the prohibition against price discrimination. Records of such special rates and terms shall be retained by the telecommunications provider for the length of time that such rates and terms apply, but shall not be filed with the commission. Such rates shall be effective upon execution by the parties.

        In fixing rates, joint rates, tolls, fares, charges, or schedules for service, no privately owned public utility that supplies water to municipal governments is allowed to charge rates, joint rates, tolls, fares, charges, or schedules of any kind whatsoever in connection with fire hydrant service to a municipal government providing fire protection services within the service area. The utility, however, may recover its costs of providing fire hydrant service by charging rates, joint rates, tolls, fares, charges or schedules to its non-municipal government customers within the service area as approved by the Tennessee public utility commission. New rates shall take effect as prescribed by the Tennessee public utility commission in a rate proceeding. Such rate proceeding shall be initiated by the utility or the Tennessee public utility commission itself. Such rate proceeding shall be commenced within 120 days after May 18, 2004. The utility shall continue to collect its current authorized rates from a municipality until new rates are placed into effect by the Tennessee public utility commission. The municipal government will reimburse the state for any consequent increase in expenditures to the state, up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), which results directly from this subsection (d).

       <p>
        The right to control rates charged by a public utility remains in the general assembly and cannot be exercised by a municipality except under grant of power from the general assembly. Grant of power to municipality to enact ordinances for “the general welfare” does not authorize regulation of rates. Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Memphis, 200 F. 657, 1912 U.S. App. LEXIS 1889 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of municipal ordinances are nugatory so far as they conflict with the state's power to regulate rates. Lewis v. Nashville Gas & Heating Co., 162 Tenn. 268, 40 S.W.2d 409, 1930 Tenn. LEXIS 88 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to establish rates is a legislative one, and the court's only power is to correct errors after rates are fixed. McCollum v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 163 Tenn. 277, 43 S.W.2d 390, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 112 (1931); Williams v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 164 Tenn. 313, 47 S.W.2d 758, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        While commission (now authority) in fixing rates must necessarily, within reason, fix a certain definite period on which they establish the rate base, in considering this period they should also consider the experiences of the past in reference to experiences of the future and fix the rate with reference to what possibly may happen in the future. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 202 Tenn. 465, 304 S.W.2d 640, 1957 Tenn. LEXIS 413 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section purports to give the commission (now authority) power over rates of all public utilities; thus the commission (now commission) had the authority to require railroad companies operating in the state to open certain interchanges and to establish joint rates in connection with intrastate shipments. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 542 S.W.2d 813, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 523 (Tenn. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the wholly-owned subsidiary was nothing more than an operating division of the parent, it was proper for the public service commission (now authority) to consider the sales made by parent to subsidiary in fixing the rates to be applied to the subsidiary, despite the fact that the two corporations had independent corporate structures. Tennessee Public Service Com. v. Nashville Gas Co., 551 S.W.2d 315, 1977 Tenn. LEXIS 521 (Tenn. 1977), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">434 U.S. 904</cite>, <cite class="s_court">98 S. Ct. 301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">54 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 191, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3656 (1977), cert. denied, Nashville Gas Co. v. Tennessee Public Service Com., <cite class="us_code">434 U.S. 904</cite>, <cite class="s_court">98 S. Ct. 301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">54 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 191, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3656 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no requirement in any rate case that the commission receive and consider cost of service data, or that such data, if in the record, are to be accorded exclusivity. CF Industries v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 599 S.W.2d 536, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 455 (Tenn. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The criteria by which the commission (now authority) should be guided have received only generalized comments in reported decisions, which is proper because the courts are playing a limited role in reviewing actions which essentially are legislative in character. CF Industries v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 599 S.W.2d 536, 1980 Tenn. LEXIS 455 (Tenn. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rates need not be determined using definite rules or precise formulas; a rate need only fall within the “zone of reasonableness” that takes into consideration the interests of both the consumer and the utility. Tennessee Cable Television Ass'n v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 844 S.W.2d 151, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 583 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A rate should be reasonable not only when it is first established but also for a reasonable time thereafter. Tennessee Cable Television Ass'n v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 844 S.W.2d 151, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 583 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A telephone company's financial integrity and the adequacy of its service are inextricably linked in rate-making and adequacy-of-service proceedings; accordingly, the public service commission (now authority) must consider the adequacy of the company's service when it is fixing rates, and must consider the company's financial condition before requiring it to establish new service or to expand existing service. Tennessee Cable Television Ass'n v. Tennessee Public Service Com., 844 S.W.2d 151, 1992 Tenn. App. LEXIS 583 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission (now authority) has the discretion to choose a historical test period, a forecast period, a combination of the two, or any other accepted method in rate making. American Ass'n of Retired Persons v. Tennessee Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 896 S.W.2d 127, 1994 Tenn. App. LEXIS 532 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tennessee Regulatory Authority did not err in utilizing a federal income tax return filed by a pipeline's previous owner to establish the pipeline's value for the purpose of determining the rate bas because its decision to exclude the purchase price of the pipeline and wells from the rate base was supported by substantial and material evidence; A consumer advocate's witness opined that the tax return was the most reliable information concerning the prior owner's assessment of value. Pipeline, LLC v. Tenn. Regulatory Auth., — S.W.3d —, 2017 Tenn. App. LEXIS 733 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 24, 2017).

        On application by a complainant as to rates of a utility corporation for a postponement of hearing, a requirement by the commission (now authority) that an affidavit be filed showing grounds for postponement was reasonable and a failure to comply was an abandonment of the proceeding. Williams v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 164 Tenn. 313, 47 S.W.2d 758, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        The original jurisdiction of the commission (now authority) may not be defeated by invoking its action without offering proof to sustain the petition, and then, after the commission (now authority) has acted, by seeking a hearing de novo in the circuit court by certiorari. Williams v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 164 Tenn. 313, 47 S.W.2d 758, 1931 Tenn. LEXIS 36 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a presumption that, before rates are ordered to be put into effect, the commission (now authority) complied with its legal duty as prescribed by this section by giving the utility proper notice and hearing. Kentucky-Tennessee Light & Power Co. v. Dunlap, 181 Tenn. 105, 178 S.W.2d 636, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 349 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of the commission (now authority) in reducing the rates for electricity in a certain city without the hearing provided for in this section was not wholly void but at most, voidable at the insistence of the utility.

        Where chancery court found that amount of increase allowed by commission (now authority) was arbitrary and confiscatory the remand of the case to the commission for the fixing of a reasonable rate was proper.

        When any public utility shall increase any existing individual rates, joint rates, tolls, fares, charges, or schedules thereof, or change or alter any existing classification, the commission  shall have power either upon written complaint, or upon its own initiative, to hear and determine whether the increase, change or alteration is just and reasonable. The burden of proof to show that the increase, change, or alteration is just and reasonable shall be upon the public utility making the same. In determining whether such increase, change or alteration is just and reasonable, the commission  shall take into account the safety, adequacy and efficiency or lack thereof of the service or services furnished by the public utility. The commission  shall have authority pending such hearing and determination to order the suspension, not exceeding three (3) months from the date of the increase, change, or alteration until the commission  shall have approved the increase, change, or alteration; provided, that if the investigation cannot be completed within three (3) months, the commission  shall have authority to extend the period of suspension for such further period as will reasonably enable it to complete its investigation of any such increase, change or alteration; and provided further, that the commission  shall give the investigation preference over other matters pending before it and shall decide the matter as speedily as possible, and in any event not later than nine (9) months after the filing of the increase, change or alteration. It shall be the duty of the commission  to approve any such increase, change or alteration upon being satisfied after full hearing that the same is just and reasonable.

          If the investigation has not been concluded and a final order made at the expiration of six (6) months from the date filed of any such increase, change or alteration, the utility may place the proposed increase, change or alteration, or any portion thereof, in effect at any time thereafter prior to the final commission  decision thereon upon notifying the commission, in writing, of its intention so to do; provided, that the commission  may require the utility to file with the commission  a bond in an amount equal to the proposed annual increase conditioned upon making any refund ordered by the commission  as provided in subdivision (b)(2).
         </li>
         <li id="t65c05s65-5-103ol1b2">
          Where increased rates or charges are thus made effective, the interested utility shall maintain its records in such a manner as will enable it, or the commission, to determine the amounts to be refunded and to whom due, in the event a refund is subsequently ordered by the commission as provided in this subdivision (b)(2). Upon completion of the hearing and decision, the commission  may order the utility to refund, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such increase, change or alteration as shall have been collected under bond and subsequently disallowed by the commission. If the commission, at any time during the initial three (3) months' suspension period, finds that an emergency exists or that the utility's credit or operations will be materially impaired or damaged by the failure to permit the rates to become effective during the three-month period, the commission  may permit all or a portion of the increase, change or alteration to become effective under such terms and conditions as the commission  may by order prescribe. Any increase, change or alteration placed in effect under this subsection (b) under bond may be continued in effect by the utility, pending final determination of the proceeding by final order of the commission  or, if the matter be appealed, by final order of the appellate court. Should the final order of the commission  be appealed while increased rates or charges are being collected under bond, the court shall have power to order an increase or decrease in the amount of the bond as the court may determine to be proper. In the event that all or any portion of such rates or charges have not been placed into effect under bond before the commission, the court considering an appeal from an order of the commission  shall have the power to permit the utility to place all or any part of the rates or charges into effect under bond.

        In the event the commission, by order, directs any utility to make a refund, as provided in subsection (b), of all or any portion of such increase, change or alteration, the utility shall make the same within ninety (90) days after a final determination of the proceeding by final order of the commission  or, if the matter be appealed, by final order of the appellate court, with lawful interest thereon.

          “Basic local exchange telephone services” are telecommunications services which are comprised of an access line, dial tone, touch-tone and usage provided to the premises for the provision of two-way switched voice or data transmission over voice grade facilities of residential customers or business customers within a local calling area, Lifeline, Link-Up Tennessee, 911 Emergency Services and educational discounts existing on June 6, 1995, or other services required by state or federal statute. These services shall, at a minimum, be provided at the same level of quality as is being provided on June 6, 1995. Rates for these services shall include both recurring and nonrecurring charges.

        The commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may find that the public interest and the policies set forth in this part are served by exempting a service or group of services from all or a portion of the requirements of this part. Upon making such a finding, the commission may exempt telecommunications service providers from such requirements as appropriate. The commission shall in any event exempt a telecommunications service for which existing and potential competition is an effective regulator of the price of those services.

The price floor shall equal the incumbent local exchange telephone company's tariffed rates for essential elements utilized by competing telecommunications service providers plus the total long-run incremental cost of the competitive elements of the service. When shown to be in the public interest, the commission shall exempt a service or group of services provided by an incumbent local exchange telephone company from the requirement of the price floor. The commission shall, as appropriate, also adopt other rules or issue orders to prohibit cross-subsidization, preferences to competitive services or affiliated entities, predatory pricing, price squeezing, price discrimination, tying arrangements or other anti-competitive practices.

        The commission shall enter an order within ninety (90) days of the application of an incumbent local exchange telephone company implementing a price regulation plan for such company. With the implementation of a price regulation plan, the rates existing on January 1, 2009, for all basic local exchange telephone services and non-basic services, as defined in § 65-5-108, are deemed affordable if the incumbent local exchange telephone company's earned rate of return on its most recent Tennessee public utility commission 3.01 report as audited by the commission staff pursuant to subsection (j) is equal to or less than the company's current authorized fair rate of return existing at the time of the company's application. If the incumbent local exchange telephone company's earned rate of return on its most recent Tennessee public utility commission 3.01 report as audited by the commission staff pursuant to subsection (j) is greater than the company's current authorized fair rate of return, the commission shall initiate a contested, evidentiary proceeding to establish the initial rates on which the price regulation plan is based. The commission shall initiate such a rate-setting proceeding to determine a fair rate of return on the company's rate base using the actual intrastate operating revenues, expenses, rate base and capital structure from the company's most recent Tennessee public utility commission 3.01 report as audited by the commission staff pursuant to subsection (j). If the incumbent local exchange telephone company's earned rate of return is less than its current authorized fair rate of return, the company may request the commission to initiate a contested, evidentiary proceeding to establish the initial rates upon which the price regulation plan is based. Upon request by the incumbent local exchange telephone company, the commission shall initiate such a contested, evidentiary proceeding using the same rate-setting procedures described above. Rates established pursuant to the above process shall be the initial rates on which a price regulation plan is based, subject to such further adjustment as may be made by the commission pursuant to § 65-5-107. Nothing in this section shall require a company that has elected price regulation prior to 2009 to reapply for price regulation or to reset its rates under its price regulation plan. Such a company is entitled, in its sole discretion, to the 1995 rates upon which its original election was based or may base its price regulation calculation upon rates in effect as of January 1, 2009.

An incumbent local exchange telephone company may adjust its rates for basic local exchange telephone services or non-basic services only so long as its aggregate revenues for basic local exchange telephone services or non-basic services generated by such changes do not exceed the aggregate revenues generated by the maximum rates permitted by the price regulation plan.

        Notwithstanding the annual adjustments permitted in subsection (e), the initial basic local exchange telephone service rates of an incumbent local exchange telephone company subject to price regulation shall not increase for a period of four (4) years from the date the incumbent local exchange telephone company becomes subject to such regulation. At the expiration of the four-year period, an incumbent local exchange telephone company is permitted to adjust annually its rates for basic local exchange telephone services in accordance with the method set forth in subsection (e); provided, that the rate for residential basic local exchange telephone service shall not be increased in any one (1) year by more than the percentage change in inflation for the United States using the gross domestic product-price index (GDP-PI) from the preceding year as the measure of inflation.

An incumbent local exchange telephone company may adjust its rates for interconnection services only so long as its aggregate revenues generated by such changes do not exceed the aggregate revenues generated by the maximum rates permitted by this subsection (g); provided, that each new rate must comply with the requirements of § 65-5-108 and the non-discrimination provisions of this title. Upon filing by a competing telecommunications service provider of a complaint, such rate adjustment shall become subject to commission review of the adjustment's compliance with this section and rules promulgated under this section.

Rates for call waiting service provided by an incumbent local exchange telephone company subject to price regulation shall not exceed, for a period of four (4) years from the date the company becomes subject to such regulation, the maximum rate in effect in the state for such service on January 1, 2009; provided, however, that the maximum rate shall not apply to companies becoming subject to that regulation after June 1, 2009.

        Neither the public service commission (now authority) nor its staff has any power to adjust any of the figures contained in an incumbent local telephone company's Form PSC-3.01 report as long as the report is correct, based on required auditing principles and consistent with the authority's previously ordered rate making adjustments. Thus, the commission (now authority) exceeded its authority under this section by adjusting the figures to compensate for out of period items, abnormal or unusual expenses, and known charges.

        Whether a railroad company acquired its right of way by condemnation or warranty deed, conveying the fee is no ground for distinction in determining whether a prescriptive way can be acquired over such right of way, for, regardless of the mode of acquisition, a railroad company, under this section, holds property only for railroad purposes.

        A prescriptive way over such right of way cannot be acquired, even where the right of way is in possession of the company as lessee. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Sharp, 141 Tenn. 146, 207 S.W. 728, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 76 (1918).

        There is no legislation which prohibits a railroad company from building a railroad or causing one to be built parallel to its own line. The object of legislation in regard to parallel and competing lines is to prevent the consolidation or acquisition of one railroad by a parallel and competing railroad. Memphis & S. L. R. Co. v. Union R. Co., 116 Tenn. 500, 95 S.W. 1019, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1906). (However, there are provisions in some of the legislative charters of railroads prohibiting any other railroads to be built running laterally within 20 miles of the route and line adopted by another railroad under its charter, as was done in the charter of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad Company, as appears from Acts 1845-1846, ch. 1, § 13).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question cannot be collaterally raised whether such proposed railroad is controlled by another existing railroad, so as to render the construction of the proposed railroad illegal, because the two roads will be parallel and competing.

        The right of condemnation is of statutory origin, and is limited to the provision of the statute; and where a railroad company has already condemned and approximated the maximum width allowed by statute, the company has exhausted its right of condemnation at such point, and is not entitled to condemn and take for any purpose, or on any account, private property lying outside the limits.

      </h3>
      <p>
       It is unlawful for any corporation or person to construct or use an ordinary railroad for the transportation of freight and passengers upon any county road or county highway of this state, without the consent of the county legislative body of the county in which the road lies. Before it is lawful for the county legislative body to give such consent, the corporation desiring to construct such railroad shall procure and file with the county legislative body the written consent of the owners of the lands abutting upon such road or highway, aggregating in such abutting length at least one-half (½) of all the lands in value, such value to be the value of the abutting lands running back from such road two hundred feet (200') upon both sides of the road to be occupied by the railroad. Any ordinary railroad constructed upon such county road or highway, without the consent of the county legislative body first lawfully obtained, shall be considered a nuisance, and liable to be treated as such, both by the public authorities and by private persons. But when the consent of the county legislative body has been first lawfully obtained, such railroad may be lawfully constructed and operated upon such road or highway under such restrictions as to the manner of construction and mode of use as the county legislative body may see fit to impose in granting the license; provided, that railroads already constructed upon any road or highway of this state under a license of the county legislative body are declared to be lawfully constructed, and this section shall not be construed as requiring a new license from the county legislative body for such construction or operation under its provisions.

        In a condemnation suit by a railroad company for its right of way, the fact that the company is improperly occupying the public highway with its roadbed and tracks, without the consent of either the abutting owner or the county court is immaterial so far as the rights of the landowner whose property is sought to be condemned for such right of way are concerned. While a railroad company improperly occupying the public highway may be enjoined in a proper proceeding, such improper occupation is no ground of defense to a proceeding to condemn and appropriate other land for a right of way.

       Any railroad company operating a railroad, or any part of same, in this state, shall have power to build or acquire lateral or branch lines of railroad, not to exceed fifteen (15) miles in length, for any one (1) of such lateral or branch roads, extending from its main stem in the state to any mine or quarry, or into any mineral section of country tributary to such main stem, or to any mill, factory, or to the bank of any navigable stream, for the purpose of developing the resources of the country without any amendment to the charter of the railroad. Such railroads shall have power to condemn private property for use in the construction and operation of such lateral or branch roads; provided, that private property shall not be taken therefor, against the owner's will, without condemnation thereof, as provided by law in other cases, and such roads shall be, as common carriers, subject to the same duties and restrictions as the main lines with which they connect.

         <p>
          This statute was intended to protect lands and crops of adjacent landowners or their tenants from the incursion of stray cattle and other livestock and also to prevent escape of such animals from the premises. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Timmons, 116 Tenn. 29, 91 S.W. 1116, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1906).
         </p>
         <p>
          The object of this statute is to give protection to the owner of the enclosed land through which the unfenced railroad track runs, whether such owner is a tenant or an owner in fee, not to furnish protection to the stranger whose trespassing animals are injured in endeavoring to pass over the cattle guard, either into the enclosure of the landowner or when being driven out by him or his employees. If he is entitled to any relief at all, it must be outside of this statute. Hardin v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry., 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 359 (1910). See Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Timmons, 116 Tenn. 29, 91 S.W. 1116, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1906).

         <p>
          A railroad company is not relieved of its statutory duty by reason of the fact that the enclosed premises on one side of the track are unfit for agricultural or other uses. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Bigbee, 100 Tenn. 204, 45 S.W. 671, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1897).
         </p>
         <p>
          Where the railroad runs along the side of the land and does not enter the enclosure, the question whether the railroad company is bound to erect the cattle guards is reserved, but doubt is expressed as to such requirement. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Bigbee, 100 Tenn. 204, 45 S.W. 671, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1897).
         </p>
         <p>
          As a condition precedent to the recovery of damages for the failure of the railroad company to erect the cattle guards, the occupation of the landowner must be evidenced by a fence or some other form of enclosure, to which the railroad company may join its cattle guards, devices, or wing fences. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Bigbee, 100 Tenn. 204, 45 S.W. 671, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1897); Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Timmons, 116 Tenn. 29, 91 S.W. 1116, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1906).

         </h4>
         <p>
          The track may be fenced in lieu of cattle guards, if such precaution be necessary to the protection of the track. The statute provides for cattle guards, but its purpose will be met by equivalent protection in another form. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Timmons, 116 Tenn. 29, 91 S.W. 1116, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1906).
         </p>
         <p>
          The requirement as to cattle guards is for the benefit of the landowner, and he may waive the same; and he cannot lawfully complain of injuries suffered during the existence of such waiver. Where the landowner enters into negotiations with the railroad company for the fencing of his lands on the basis of a division of the expense, in lieu of putting in cattle guards, he will be held to have waived the absence of cattle guards during the pendency of such negotiations. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Timmons, 116 Tenn. 29, 91 S.W. 1116, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1906).
         </p>
         <p>
          It is no defense that cattle guards would endanger trains. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Timmons, 116 Tenn. 29, 91 S.W. 1116, 1905 Tenn. LEXIS 3 (1906).
         </p>
         <p>
          The sufficiency of a cattle guard is a question of fact, and where there is material proof showing its insufficiency, the appellate court is bound by the finding of such insufficiency by the circuit judge sitting as a jury. Tennessee C.R.R. v. Smith, 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 208 (1910).
         </p>
         <p>
          A railroad company is not liable to the owner of adjacent land for the death of his mule resulting from injuries received by attempting to cross a cattle guard erected by the railroad company at a place where it was under no obligation to erect and maintain the same. The railroad company was under no common law or statutory duty to fence its track at this point to keep off trespassing animals; and since the mule was not killed or injured by a moving train, the company owed the plaintiff no statutory duty to fence its track at that point. Hardin v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry., 1 Tenn. Civ. App. (1 Higgins) 359 (1910).

          </span>
         </h4>
         <p>
          While the statute does not, in terms, require the railroad company to construct any wings, but only good and sufficient cattle guards or stops at the line of the field of enclosure, yet it is required to construct its pits or other devices across its track and upon its roadway, cuts, and embankments until it reaches the point where the land is being used and occupied by the landowner as the owner of the fee; and it is the duty of such landowner to construct the wing fences over that part of the right of way occupied and used by him, with proper wings connecting with the cattle guards and other devices of the railroad company and its line of roadway. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Bigbee, 100 Tenn. 204, 45 S.W. 671, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1897).
         </p>
         <p>
          The duty of a railroad company to provide wing fences or other devices in connection with its pits and cattle guards is satisfied by the erection of wing fences extending over that part of its right of way which is actually occupied and used by the company for railroad purposes. The landowner owning the fee in the right of way must maintain fences upon that part of the right of way which has not been appropriated by the company for railroad purposes and which still remains in his possession. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Bigbee, 100 Tenn. 204, 45 S.W. 671, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 157 (1897).

          When livestock enters upon the track where it is not required to be fenced, and pursues it until struck by a train at a point where the track is required to be fenced but is not fenced, the railroad company, in the absence of other negligence, would not be liable under the statute. But as the statute imposes upon the company the duty to construct sufficient cattle guards, the company will be liable if it has not constructed cattle guards sufficient to prevent the stock from pursuing the track and colliding with the train.

       The constitutional provision prohibiting counties and municipal corporations to give or lend their credit or to become stockholders in any enterprises for county and corporation purposes, respectively, is self-executing as to the restriction and limitation upon their power; but this constitutional provision does not, by implication, authorize the giving or lending of credit, or the taking of stock in such enterprises, even upon the assent of three fourths of the votes cast in the election. The required election to obtain such assent of the voters must be authorized and held pursuant to valid statute enacted for that purpose. Johnson City v.

It would seem that the qualification of the applicant, as to whether it is a foreign or domestic corporation, is one of the subjects, an important one, to be considered in forming an opinion whether the application should be submitted to the electors or not. The general trend of the decisions is to hold that, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, the general assembly intended that the question of the existence of the conditions upon which the power is granted should be referred to the governing body of the municipality exercising the power.

       Where a railroad is exempt from taxation by a provision in its charter, and a suit is instituted by the state to enforce its statutory mortgage and asks for a sale under which terms are to be specified by the court pursuant to statute, and the decree vests in the purchaser all of the rights, privileges and immunities of debtor corporation, the immunity from taxation passes to the purchaser.

       A grant of immunity from taxation does not pass in suit by state to foreclose lien where the decree merely specifies that the franchise and property of railroad is to be sold, since decree must expressly state that rights, privileges and immunities are included in the sale in order for the immunity from taxation to pass.

        Liens of subcontractors and furnishers are independent of those of the contractor, and are not dependent upon contractor's having perfected his lien; they are independent of and superior to his lien, and are limited only by the amount due the principal contractor at the time of the service of notice on the railroad company. Green v. Williams, 92 Tenn. 220, 21 S.W. 520, 1892 Tenn. LEXIS 66, <cite class="lra">19 L.R.A. 478</cite> (1893); Central Trust Co. v. Condon, 67 F. 84, 1895 U.S. App. LEXIS 2725 (6th Cir.

       <p>
        A bill may be treated as one to enforce a subcontractor's lien, where a subcontractor, within the time limited after service of notice of lien on the railroad company, filed a bill against such company, making the principal contractor and all other parties holding liens or mortgages on the road parties, in which bill he claimed a principal contractor's lien, but alleged that, owing to the dealings between the principal contractor and the railroad company, it was doubtful whether the complainant and others engaged in the construction of the road were principal contractors or subcontractors, and asked that their liens be declared first liens, or for such other or different relief as might seem meet.

       <p>
        The principal contractors filed a bill in behalf of all creditors to establish their lien as principal contractors, and did not dispute the claims of their subcontractors. This did not relieve the latter from proving their liens in statutory manner as against other subcontractors entitled to share in the funds, which are insufficient to pay all. A subcontractor who thus established his lien is entitled to payment in full if the funds admit. McDonald v. Charleston, C. & C. R. Co., 37 S.W. 1034, 1896 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 53 (1896).

Such landowner is entitled to this relief, notwithstanding the fact that the lessee is holding under the state as lessor, by reason of the fact of the state's holding the road under its statutory mortgage.

        It is not necessary that the creditor for personal injuries should be a preexisting judgment creditor against the mortgagor corporation to assert his lien against the property in the hands of the corporation purchaser at the sale under the mortgage. Such creditor may obtain his judgment against the mortgagor corporation and enforce the same against the property thereof in the hands of the purchaser in the same suit. Frazier v. East T., V. &amp; G. R. Co., 88 Tenn. 138, 12 S.W. 537, 1889 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1889), aff'd, East Tennessee, V. &amp; G. R. Co. v.

        A judgment in a suit in a state court establishing a lien on a railroad under the statute does not bind the trustee under the mortgage or the bondholders of the road who are not made parties to the suit, and cannot operate even as prima facie evidence, where there is not at least a constructive notice to the adverse claimants, requiring them to appear and maintain their rights.

        Complainant cannot acquire a prior right through the instrumentality of a judgment lien pending insolvency proceeding against a railroad company in federal court and while its property was in the hands of a receiver of that court. A judgment creditor had not the right to enforce the lien by requisite sale while the property was so situated. Barnett v. East T., V. & G. R. Co., 48 S.W. 817, 1898 Tenn. Ch. App. LEXIS 114 (1898).

        A judgment recovered against a receiver of a railroad company for a wrongful death from negligence in operation of the railroad is prior to receiver's certificates, for the receiver stands in no more favored position as to priority against such judgment than the railroad company itself.

         Where a materialman agrees with a subcontractor to furnish him all the materials required for the construction of a railroad, which are furnished and delivered, pursuant to the contract, as and when needed and required by the purchaser, the contract is an entirety, and a notice within 90 days from the date of the last delivery secures the lien on all the deliveries.

         The fact that the last shipment of materials to a subcontractor was stopped in transitu, because of the purchaser's insolvency and abandonment of the construction contract, does not affect the seller's lien for the materials previously furnished by him to such subcontractor, though furnished more than 90 days prior to the notice of the claim of a lien, where such notice is given within ten days after such failure of the subcontractor, and his consequent breach of the contract.

      <p>
       By legislation of this character it was the intention to require railroads to construct and keep in repair good and sufficient crossings where the tracks of the company are crossed by a public road, the purpose being to make such crossings easy of approach and as safe as possible in cases of emergency. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. State, 137 Tenn. 341, 193 S.W. 113, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 80 (1917).

       <span class="boldspan">
        2. Duty to Construct and Maintain Crossing.
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The phrase “good and sufficient crossing” means one suitable for the ordinary exigencies of travel upon the road at that particular place. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Evins, 13 Tenn. App. 57, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 126 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common law required a railroad to erect and maintain such a crossing as convenience and safety required, and this is the extent of the company's obligation under this section. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Evins, 13 Tenn. App. 57, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 126 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section a railroad company is required to keep its crossing in a reasonably safe condition for public travel, the railroad not being an insurer against accidental injury or death. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Evins, 13 Tenn. App. 57, — S.W.2d —, 1930 Tenn. App. LEXIS 126 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1930).
      </p>

       Where railroad was charged with negligence in maintenance of crossing, and evidence justified verdict against defendant, it was immaterial whether railroad was also guilty of violation of duties at “designated crossing” imposed by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c12s65-12-108" target="_self">65-12-108</a></cite>.

       Violation of this section does not create an additional cause of action for damages arising out of an accident at a railroad crossing, but merely presents an additional ground of negligence.

       While a municipality is under a duty to the public to maintain its streets in a reasonably safe repair, nevertheless railroads having a right of way upon and across such streets have a common law duty to keep in repair so much and such parts of these streets as may be under the control of the railroad and necessary for its operation.

      Every corporation or person operating a line of railroad within the state is required to maintain or construct to a plane with the rails of the railroad and to keep in repair every public road crossing of such railroad for a distance of ten feet (10') on each side of such railroad track and between the rails thereof. Where superelevated track or tracks or other physical conditions make strict compliance with this section impractical, the plane shall be constructed so as to provide the best vertical alignment under the circumstances with due regard to surface regularity.

       This statute requires the railroad to make the public road at a railroad crossing level for the distance of 10 feet on each side of the rails, and between the rails, and to keep the same in repair, and is not complied with by merely bringing the public roadway to a level with the rails at the point of contact with the rails.

       The term “grade,” when used in reference to streets, has two distinct meanings; and, by the first meaning, it signifies the line of the street's inclination from the horizontal; and, by its second meaning, it signifies a part of the street inclined from the horizontal; that is, it sometimes signifies the line established to guide future construction, and at other times, the street wrought to the line; and when the term “grade” is used in a decree laying out a street of a certain width, and prescribing the grade along its center line, refers to the physical condition of the street when its construction is complete.

       A railroad company, in constructing its road over or across a public highway, must, if possible, construct its road without any inconvenience to the public; but if it cannot be done without some inconvenience, it must be done with the least possible inconvenience. If a bridge or substituted road be necessary to prevent the obstruction, the railroad company must build it immediately or in a reasonable time, and cannot delay it until its road is completed. The company must so use its own rights as not to injure or take away the rights of others. These are the rules under the common law, and the established rules, whether the obstruction of the highway be expressly prohibited in the charter or general statutes. Louisville & N. R. Co. v.

The county legislative body shall appropriate money to defray the expenses of the signs.

       Plaintiffs were not permitted to allege as an act of negligence any failure of the defendant railroad to establish and maintain adequate warning signs, devices or other safety appliances because the railroad was not required by Tennessee law to erect warning signs at crossings; that was the function of the overseers of public roads.

       Note.  Prior to the 1959 amendment the sign required to be erected in subsection (1) was to be erected by the “overseer” of the public road and under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c12s65-12-109" target="_self">65-12-109</a></cite> the railroad was responsible for all damages when failing to comply regardless of negligence but under former § 65-1210 was not responsible if it complied. With these exceptions the following cases would seem to apply to the present section.

       It was manifest that all the provisions in this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c12s65-12-109" target="_self">65-12-109</a></cite> were to be taken as a whole, and considered together. East T. &amp; V. R.R. Co. v. Swaney, 73 Tenn. 119, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 95 (1880); Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Binkley, 127 Tenn. 77, 153 S.W. 59, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1912). See also Memphis &amp; C.R.R. v. Scott, 87 Tenn. 494, 11 S.W. 317 (1889).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the statute embraced in subdivision (2), as well as those in subsection (3) (deleted by amendment), are not concurrent with, or declaratory of, the common law, but wholly statutory. Chesapeake & N. R. Co. v. Crews, 118 Tenn. 52, 99 S.W. 368, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 79 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court knows, as a matter of history, that when the provisions of the Code were made, the steam railroad had not been developed to the present high state of perfection, and that the wood fire engines made much less speed than engines do now. Hurt v. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co., 140 Tenn. 623, 205 S.W. 437, 1918 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c12s65-12-109" target="_self">65-12-109</a></cite> are in derogation of the common law, they are also remedial in character and are entitled to a construction which will not defeat the purposes had in mind by the general assembly at the time of their enactment. Stem v. Nashville I. Ry., 142 Tenn. 494, 221 S.W. 192, 1919 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       In construing this section, the true intent of the general assembly should be carried out; but the statute should not be enlarged by implication. Gordon v. Tennessee C. R. Co., 167 Tenn. 302, 69 S.W.2d 611, 1933 Tenn. LEXIS 41 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute is in the nature of a penal regulation, for safety purposes, and the failure to observe the statute and injury following, creates liability. Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Brookshire, 166 F.2d 278, 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 2332, 1 A.L.R.2d 612 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to observe statutory precautions fixed absolute liability upon the railroad. Nashville, C. & S. L. Ry. v. Smith, 33 Tenn. App. 45, 228 S.W.2d 495, 1949 Tenn. App. LEXIS 123 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1949).

      <p>
       The rights and liabilities of a railroad company in this state in regard to accidental injuries to persons or property as they existed at common law have generally been merged into statutory regulations by which those rights and liabilities are clearly defined. Southern R. Co. v. Noah, 180 Tenn. 532, 176 S.W.2d 826, 1944 Tenn. LEXIS 319 (1944).

       The statute is imperative in its requirements. Nashville & C. R. R. Co. v. Thomas, 52 Tenn. 262, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 260 (1871); Hill v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 56 Tenn. 823, 1872 Tenn.

LEXIS 22 (1911); Southern Ry. v. Harris, 9 Tenn. App. 589, 1929 Tenn. App. LEXIS 115 (1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each and all of the precautions (except those required of overseers of public roads, by subdivision (1)) are required to be observed by the railroad employees in the operation of engines and trains; but no correlative duty to observe any precautions whatever to carry out the purpose of this legislation is laid upon a person whose “person, animal, or other obstruction appears upon the road.” Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Binkley, 127 Tenn. 77, 153 S.W. 59, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 11 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>

       The railroad would not be exonerated from liability if it had observed all the statutory precautions after the decedent's wagon appeared on the railroad track in a position to be struck by the nearing train, where it had previously failed to comply with the requirements of this statute, by its failure to sound the bell or whistle on approaching the crossing, for all the precautions must be complied with.

       The utmost care and diligence is required of railroad companies to prevent accidents; the defense that all effort to avoid the accident would have been ineffectual will not be tolerated for the protection of the company; the injunctions of the law upon them are peremptory.

       A railroad company is responsible for the damages occasioned by, or resulting from, the accident or collision, unless it shows that the statutory precautions were performed; and the fact that the accident or collision would have occurred had the precautions been performed will not relieve the railroad company from the performance thereof, or from the liability for the damages resulting from the accident.

       The provisions of this and the succeeding section are inapplicable to the operation of trains where, because of the locality or existing conditions, compliance with the statute is impossible, as where engines or cars are being switched and are necessarily being pushed instead of pulled by the engine.

       The statutory precautions for the prevention of accidents on railroads do not apply where it is impossible to comply therewith, or wholly impracticable, consistently with the operation of the road, as in cases of switching operations, or where it is necessary in or about the yards to push cars with the engine moving backwards; but the railroad company cannot be excused by “impracticability” which it unnecessarily causes or tolerates. Where the plaintiff's intestate was struck and killed at a street crossing by cars being so pushed, on a track extending along a cross street, extending from the terminal of one railroad to that of another, to which the cars, with their loads, were being transferred, it was a question of fact whether the situation was such as to make the statute applicable, and evidence as to the length of the transfer track, the extent of its use, the character of the country traversed, and the means or practicability of transferring the engine around, so as to return on the track if it preceded the cars, was relevant and admissible, and its rejection constituted reversible error.

      <p>
       The means employed to stop the train should not be such as would cause imminent risk and danger to the passengers, but a slight increase of the danger to the passengers will be no excuse for failing to follow the positive mandate of the statute. The employees of the railroad company will not be allowed to excuse themselves from failing to comply with the positive requirements by the mere expression of an opinion that to do so would endanger the passengers. The nature and extent of that danger should be clearly shown. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Connor, 56 Tenn. 19, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 423 (1871); Memphis & C.R.R. v. Smith, 56 Tenn. 860, 1872 Tenn.

       The duty of railroad companies to carry their passengers safely is paramount to all others, and is superior to the statutory requirements and precautions; and the statutory precautions should not be observed, when to do so would imminently imperil the lives and limbs of passengers and employees on the train; but these precautions should be observed when human life is in danger on the road, and the probability of slight injuries to passengers and employees, or even serious injuries growing out of unusual positions which they may at the time occupy, will not excuse the observance of such precautions for the protection of the life of a trespasser.

      <p>
       The paramount object of the statute is the protection of human life, and the protection of property is a secondary consideration. Therefore, where the train is moving at such a rate of speed at the time of the collision, or the circumstances of its situation are such that it would be dangerous to the lives and limbs of the passengers and persons on the train to reverse the engine, the engineer in charge is not bound to do so, and should not do so, although such action might prevent the accident or collision. Under such circumstances, the railroad company will not be liable for the consequence of not reversing the engine. Routon v. Louisville & N.R.R., 1 Shan. 528 (1875); Nashville & C.R.R. v. Troxlee, 69 Tenn. 520, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 130 (1878); East T., V. & G. R.R. Co. v. Selcer, 75 Tenn. 557, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 152 (1881); Southern R. Co. v. Brooks, 125 Tenn. 260, 143 S.W. 62, 1911 Tenn.

      <p>
       Where an animal has been chased by an engine where the road is fenced on both sides, though during all this time the animal is in the ditch by its side, or so near it as to make a collision probable, it would not be a compliance with the statute for the engineer recklessly to run his engine at full speed, and use no effort to avoid a collision, until the animal, through fright, leaps upon the track. Nashville & C. R.R. Co. v. Anthony, 69 Tenn. 516, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 129 (1878); East T., V. & G. R.R. Co. v. Selcer, 75 Tenn. 557, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 152 (1881); Louisville & N.R.R. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statute fixing the rate of speed at which railroad trains shall be run; and the question of reckless or excessive speed is one to be determined by all the facts and circumstances at the time, and not by an arbitrary rule that the speed must not be so great that the train cannot be stopped within the distance an obstruction can be seen by the aid of the headlight. Louisville & N.R.R. v. Milam, 77 Tenn. 223, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 40 (1882). See Illinois C. R. Co. v. Porter, 117 Tenn. 13, 94 S.W. 666, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 27 (1906).

      <p>
       A railroad company unquestionably has the right to run special trains, at such times, and at such increased rates of speed within the limits of prudence and safety to its passengers, as the necessities or convenience of its business, general or special, may require; and hence a charge of the court is erroneous in assuming or implying that the running of trains off schedule time or at increased rates of speed is, per se, negligence.

       As a precaution against injury to persons walking on the track, but not seen or known so to be, there is no duty to slacken the ordinary speed of a train approaching a curve in the open country, although the curve be in whole or in part in a cut, or hidden from view by a train approaching and passing on the concave side of the curve, on a double track railroad. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry. v. Wright, 133 Tenn. 74, 179 S.W. 641, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       While no rate of speed is of itself negligence, it may be negligent to run a train at a high rate of speed through a populous community and over a much frequented crossing, or over a crossing where the view of the track is so obstructed as to render the approach dangerous. This is true although the crossing at which the accident occurs is in a country district, where the crossing is much used by the public. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is no statutory regulation fixing the rate of speed of trains, it is a question of fact whether the rate of speed was excessive or dangerous in that locality, and if so found by the jury, and the excessive speed caused the injury, the road is liable. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       Unusual and excessive speed of the train will not afford basis for a recovery unless it is the proximate cause of the injuries. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).

       The statute applies indifferently to all railroad trains, whether they are moving forward or backward, or by means of an engine placed in front or rear, or at an intermediate point in the train. As the precautions can be observed only when the train is moving forward by means of an engine in its front, the railroad company's liability for injuries inflicted by collision with its train moving backward, or by means of an engine placed elsewhere than in front, is absolute, because the railroad company has imposed upon itself the impossibility to observe the statutory precautions.

       The precautions prescribed by this statute are not applicable to switching operations within the yards of a railroad company. Common law rules control in such cases. The statute does not apply to a “switchtrain” while no obstruction appears on the track ahead between crossings. The fact that a person who could not be seen suddenly appears on the track, immediately in front of the pilot, as it is passing, does not change the rule. Moran v.

       Where the first count in the declaration alleges the defendant railroad company's failure to comply with the statutory precautions, and the second count is substantially the same, with the omission of allegations of noncompliance with the statutory precautions, both counts may state a cause of action under the statute requiring the railroad company to show a compliance. The facts alleged show whether or not the statutory precautions were applicable, and if applicable, the railroad is required to show compliance therewith without specific allegation of noncompliance.

       A count in an action for personal injuries, under this statute, is a count under the common law, unless it is further charged that the person or object on the track was struck by a moving train, which allegation of collision with a moving train is necessary to bring the count within § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c12s65-12-109" target="_self">65-12-109</a></cite>; and where the warrant did not charge that the train struck the plaintiff or her wagon, and it appeared that she jumped from the wagon, whereby she was injured without collision with the train, the action was under the common law, and there was no absolute liability for the railroad company's failure to observe the precautions. Whittaker v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 132 Tenn. 576, 179 S.W. 140, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1915).

       Where, in an action to recover for injuries alleged to have been sustained, it is not charged in the complaint that the train struck plaintiff or her wagon and it appears that she jumped from the wagon, the action is under the common law and there is no absolute liability for failure to take the specified statutory precautions.

       If, in a declaration based on the statute, there be also inserted in a single count averments based upon the common law, the effect will not be to convert the whole declaration into a common law pleading, but to lay it open to a demurrer for duplicity.

       Action of the trial court in allowing the plaintiff to amend his declaration so as to transfer from the other counts all the averments of common law negligence and put them in an additional count, thus separating them from the averments of statutory negligence in the other counts, was not error.

       Where the action for injuries on a railroad crossing is based on the common law, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show not only the infliction of the injuries, but also the negligence or wrongdoing of the company.

       Where the rights of the parties are to be settled by the common law, the rule is that where the negligence of the party injured contributed proximately to his own injury, either alone or in conjunction with that of the railroad company, there can be no recovery.

       The causal connection between the violation of the penal statute and the accident, and generally the conduct of both parties, is looked to, to determine liability, and if the negligence of plaintiff is imputed solely from the violation of a statute, and he in fact exercised his intelligence and senses, and acted as a reasonably prudent man to avoid injury, such violation of the statutes without more would not bar recovery for an injury flowing from the wrongful act of defendant.

       The negligence of a person on a railroad track, within the railroad station limits on a very dark night, in failing to look and listen when he did not know when an engine or train might appear on the track, is “gross negligence,” and peremptory instructions for the defendant should have been granted.

       Driving an automobile upon a railroad track, contrary to provisions of Acts 1917, ch. 36, is gross negligence, and if the violation of the statute is the proximate cause of a collision, this conduct should always be charged to plaintiff in mitigation of damages and in extreme cases might reduce the recovery to nominal damages; but the violation of such statute cannot be set up as altogether excusing the railroad of the imperative duty imposed upon it to observe statutes intended to protect life and property.

       Contributory negligence mitigates the damages as a matter of law, and not merely in the discretion of the jury; and a charge of the court that “the negligence of the deceased may be considered by the jury in mitigation of damages” contains affirmative and prejudicial error.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence, under the uncontroverted facts, the trial judge should instruct the jury that the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and that they must mitigate the damages on account of such negligence; and should not use language that might impress the jurors that they may or may not mitigate the damages as they see fit. N. C. & S. L. Railway Co. v. Overcast, 3 Tenn. Civ. App. (3 Higgins) 235 (1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction simply that the contributory negligence of the deceased “can go only to the reduction of damages” is not erroneous, because the jury understood from this instruction that such contributory negligence could not, under the statute, abate the action.

       The engineer of a railroad company cannot state his mere conclusion of facts to the jury that he did all in his power to prevent the accident. He must state the facts.

       Where there is no eyewitness to the accident, it is not competent for the defendant to introduce evidence tending to show that the deceased was in the habit of jumping on moving trains near the place where his body was found, for the purpose of raising an inference that his death resulted from an attempt to jump on the train on the particular occasion, but the testimony should be confined to the acts and conduct of the deceased on the particular occasion in issue, such as are competent and capable of being directly or circumstantially proved.

       Evidence as to compliance though negative in form may be positive in nature, as where a witness positively asserts that there was no act of compliance. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P.R.R. v. Abbott, 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 22 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence with respect to not sounding the whistle or bell is negative in form, though it is not necessarily so in substance, for while negative in form, it may be positive in its nature, as where a witness positively testifies that an alleged occurrence did not take place. The rule that positive evidence neutralizes and destroys negative evidence is not of universal application. The comparative weight and value of the positive and negative evidence must generally be submitted to the jury, without instructions that the one species is entitled to greater weight than the other, unless the evidence called negative is purely of that nature, such as the result of inattention. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P.R.R. v. Abbott, 5 Tenn. Civ. App. (5 Higgins) 22 (1914).

       It was for the jury to say whether the plaintiff acted with reasonable prudence and caution in jumping from the wagon threatened to be struck with a rapidly moving train, instead of trusting her safety to the speed of the horses, as the driver of the team did, and escaped injury. Whittaker v. Louisville & N.R.R., 132 Tenn. 576, 179 S.W. 140, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 48 (1915).

       Where the evidence tends to show that neither the driver of the automobile nor the deceased could see the train in time to avoid the accident, it is for the jury to decide the questions whether the railway company was negligent and whether the deceased was contributorily negligent.

       When undisputed facts with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, lead to one conclusion, about which reasonable minds would not differ, that every possible means were employed to stop the train and prevent an accident after the obstruction appeared on the track, the case does not present a factual issue to be submitted to the jury.

       The court's charge that if the company complied with the statute, the plaintiff, if guilty of contributory negligence, directly or proximately contributing to the injury, cannot recover, was erroneous if construed to authorize the jury to inquire, after finding that the company had done everything required of it by statute, whether the plaintiff was guilty of negligence, and to require the jury to find that he was so guilty before the company could be exonerated from liability, and was of a nature calculated to confuse the jury. Chesapeake & N. R. Co. v. Crews, 118 Tenn. 52, 99 S.W. 368, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 79 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action based upon the defendant railroad company's statutory liability, it is error to charge anything upon the common-law liability, except insofar as the statute is concurrent with the common law, for such charge on the distinct common-law liability inevitably tends to confuse the jury. Chesapeake & N. R. Co. v. Crews, 118 Tenn. 52, 99 S.W. 368, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 79 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the declaration is under the statute, and a paragraph of the declaration attempts to state a common-law action, instructions that it was the duty of the defendant railroad to exercise “a high degree of vigilance and caution, commensurate with the dangerous character of said crossing,” by employing every means at its command as its train approached the crossing within the corporate limits of a town, were erroneous, because the statute covered the ground, and no other precautions could be required. Middle T. R. Co. v. McMillan, 134 Tenn. 490, 184 S.W. 20, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1916).

       In a common-law action against a railroad company for damages resulting from being struck by train, court properly refused to instruct jury that defendant did not have to give warning or put on brakes until plaintiff's truck became an obstacle on track or within striking distance of the train. Tennessee C. R. Co. v. Hayes, 9 Tenn. App. 116, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 222 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928), overruled in part, Martin v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 271 S.W.3d 76, 2008 Tenn.

It could only pass on the question of precautions in reviewing the overruling of a motion for peremptory instructions or the withdrawal of such question from the jury.

      <p>
       The provision that no railroad engine driver shall be compelled to sound the whistle or bell at any public road crossing, where the proper signal has not been erected thereat by the overseer of the public road, was manifestly intended to relieve railroad companies from liability at such crossings not so designated.

       It is doubtless true that, under the common law, a duty rests upon every railroad company at a road crossing where the view is obstructed or where there is much travel, to give warning of the approach of its trains, and that this duty at common law rests upon such railroad companies, whether the crossing be marked in any way or not. Graves v. Illinois Cent. R.R., 126 Tenn. 148, 148 S.W. 239, 1912 Tenn. LEXIS 51 (Tenn. Apr. 1912).

       Where the action for injuries on crossing is based on the common law, the proximate contributory negligence of the injured party bars a recovery. Middle T. R. Co. v. McMillan, 134 Tenn. 490, 184 S.W. 20, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 174 (1916). See also Chattanooga Station Co. v. Harper, 138 Tenn. 562, 199 S.W. 394, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 65 (1917); Klein v. Illinois C. R.

       A railroad company may be liable for death in a crossing accident by reason of common law negligence, notwithstanding there is no statutory liability under the statute requiring signs, signals, and lookouts for the prevention of such accidents. Stem v. Nashville I. Ry., 142 Tenn. 494, 221 S.W. 192, 1919 Tenn. LEXIS 77 (1919).

       The standard of care that a railroad company is required to use in operating its trains across public roads of the state outside of towns and cities is fixed by the common law of the state. Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Davis, 32 F.2d 232, 1929 U.S. App. LEXIS 3756 (6th Cir. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       A railway company's negligence in creating extra hazard by stacking or permitting the stacking of lumber so near its track and the crossing as to obscure the view and to require an additional warning as a protection against the obstruction was a question for the jury. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry. v. Garrett, 25 Tenn. App. 173, 154 S.W.2d 435, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 91 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       A railroad does not have a license to commit other acts of common-law negligence, thus where the railroad did commit other acts of common-law negligence, such as excessive speed, it was not relieved of the duty to sound a warning at a public crossing even though the crossing had not been so marked by the county officials. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry. v. Garrett, 25 Tenn. App. 173, 154 S.W.2d 435, 1941 Tenn. App. LEXIS 91 (1941); Jones v. Louisville & N.R.R., 192 Tenn. 570, 241 S.W.2d 572, 1951 Tenn. LEXIS 304 (1951).

       A person about to cross the track on horseback, on seeing an approaching train, attempted to turn his horse back, but the horse became unmanageable, and the rider was struck. Whether the failure of the engineer to make any attempt to stop the train rendered the railroad company liable for the death of such person was one of fact for the jury, there being evidence that when he was first seen by the engineer, the train was at such a distance that the speed might have been slackened, if not entirely stopped, before reaching the crossing.

       When the driver of an automobile is absorbed in other matters, as in the management of his machine over a rough road, and if the jury should find that he was in the exercise of due care while so absorbed, it could not be said that he should be required to stop before entering upon a railroad track, existence and location of which he was unconscious; at least, it is a question of due care, and in cases in which the court cannot say that either party was guilty of negligence per se, it is a question for the jury.

       Proof of the incorporation of the town, in which the injury occurred, is essential to the plaintiff's case; and where the record of incorporation, which is the best evidence of the fact, is not introduced, but oral testimony tending to show user of corporate franchises by the town is admitted, without objection, conceding such evidence to be competent in such case to raise a presumption of incorporation, the question of its sufficiency is one for the jury. An instruction which makes the defendant liable, under the further provisions of the statute, if it failed to sound the bell or whistle as required, without requiring the jury first to find the fact of incorporation, is erroneous.

       A railroad company is chargeable with the knowledge of a defect in its road or machinery possessed by an engineer in its employment. Nashville & C.R.R. v. Elliott, 41 Tenn. 611, 1860 Tenn. LEXIS 114 (1860).
      </p>
      <p>
       A railroad company is not required to insure its machinery against the negligence of the manufacturer. If the defects are such that they cannot be discovered by the railroad company or its agents, after a careful and skillful application of the ordinary and approved tests, then the company will not be held responsible, although it may appear that the defects might have been discovered by the manufacturers, by applying the proper tests. Nashville & D. R. Co. v. Jones, 56 Tenn. 27, 1871 Tenn. LEXIS 424 (1871); East Tenn., V. & G.R.R. v. Smith, 77 Tenn. 685, 1882 Tenn. LEXIS 123 (1882).

       A headlight enabling the engineer to see ahead 100 yards while running at night, although not enabling him to see on either side of the track, at any great distance, is sufficient. Louisville & N.R.R. v. Stone, 54 Tenn. 468, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1872).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the light becomes obscure from rain or other natural causes, without any defect in the headlight and appurtenances, and without any fault upon the part of the employees of the railroad company, so that the lookout cannot see ahead, it is error to instruct the jury that the railroad company is, as a matter of law, liable for all the consequences for running a train on such a night. Louisville & N.R.R. v. Melton, 70 Tenn. 262, 1879 Tenn. LEXIS 172 (1879). See Memphis C. R.R. Co. v. Logue, 81 Tenn. 32, 1884 Tenn. LEXIS 5 (1884).

       A headlight is not required in daytime. Such equipment would not add to the effectiveness of the lookout, and cannot by implication, be added to the requirement of the statute, under such conditions. Southern R. Co. v. Simpson, 131 F. 705, 1904 U.S. App. LEXIS 4309 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1904).

       The phrase “lookout ahead” is treated as equivalent to lookout for objects “ahead on the track.” East T. & G. R. Co. v. St. John, 37 Tenn. 524, 1858 Tenn. LEXIS 55 (1858); Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry. v. Wright, 133 Tenn. 74, 179 S.W. 641, 1915 Tenn. LEXIS 75 (1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Always upon the lookout ahead” means only that the precaution is being observed when the accident occurs, and does not mean that the precaution should have been observed all the way; and it is reversible error not to so explain this language in the charge to the jury, where it is proved that the precaution was being observed when the accident occurred. Louisville & N.R.R. v. Stone, 54 Tenn. 468, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 74 (1872).

       “Lookout ahead” means lookout in the direction in which the engine is moving. Patton v. Railway Co., 89 Tenn. 370, 15 S.W. 919, 1890 Tenn. LEXIS 59, <cite class="lra">12 L.R.A. 184</cite> (1890).
      </p>
      <p>
       The duties of the persons on the engine arise under the statute, except as to the maintenance of the lookout, only when the obstruction appears on the track or within lateral striking distance of the train, and, if there is not time to do everything the statute requires, then the engineer must do those things first which are best calculated to prevent the accident. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Galloway, 59 F.2d 664, 1932 U.S. App. LEXIS 3439 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1932).

       Duty to maintain lookout is mandatory and it is no defense that accident would have occurred even though statutory requirement was followed. Louisville & N.R.R. v.

       While a railroad company may not be liable for a personal injury caused by its failure to maintain a lookout, because of the impossibility of doing so under the condition in which its train was being operated at the time of the accident, it may nevertheless be liable, because of the breach of its common law duty to the party injured in negligently managing its train after it knew that deceased was on its tracks and in a place of danger.

      <p>
       Under the common law, it would be the duty of a railroad company's servants to keep a lookout ahead, and also to have reasonable appliances, including a headlight of reasonable efficiency, and it would be their duty, on the appearance of any obstruction on the track, to use their utmost endeavors to prevent a collision, and also to see what could be seen by a person of good eyesight, with the aid of a proper headlight, or a proper light on the back of the engine when running backwards.

       A railroad company is liable in damages for the killing of a person upon its track by a backing engine and tender, not switching in the railroad yards. The statute applies in such case, and the railroad company is not excused because it runs its engine and tender in such manner as to preclude the possibility of observance of the statutory precautions. Iron M. R. Co. v. Dies, 98 Tenn. 655, 41 S.W. 860 (1897); Southern R. Co. v. Simpson, 131 F. 705, 1904 U.S. App. LEXIS 4309 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1904); Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry. v.

       A railroad company is absolutely liable for injuries to persons riding upon an automobile truck struck by a train running backward over a highway crossing, with numerous cars being pushed backward and ahead of the engine, so that the railroad company was unable to perform the duty imposed upon it by this statute requiring some person upon the locomotive always to be on the lookout ahead.

       When a train is not engaged in a switching operation, the voluntary act of the railroad company in placing the locomotive at the rear of a train of cars, thereby making it impossible to keep the lookout ahead required by this section, renders absolute defendant's liability for injuries to plaintiff and his automobile, where plaintiff's automobile was an obstruction on the track in front of the train.

       The lookout must be in such position on the locomotive as to enable him to see ahead to the best advantage, and he must be vigilant and watchful. If, from that position, the object is visible, and yet is not seen, the jury would be well warranted in finding that the person was not on the lookout, and that he was not vigilant. A lookout who does not see what, with due care and vigilance, should have been seen, would not be in the discharge of his duty, and would not be the lookout prescribed by this statute, and it is not reversible error to so charge.

      </p>
      <p>
       It is the imperative duty of the engineer, or other person in charge, to comply with the precautions of the statute as soon as a person is seen on the track; and the engineer must not presume that the person will step off the track on the approach of the train, as it is not known what might be the effect of the alarm whistle, even upon the maudlin brain of a drunken man, nor can it be conjectured whether the timely startle of the alarm whistle might not save his life. Hill v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 56 Tenn. 823, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 210 (1872); Southern R. Co. v. Brooks, 125 Tenn. 260, 143 S.W. 62, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that both the engineer and fireman be upon the lookout ahead, for if either is, the statute is satisfied. But where there is no insistence on the part of the railroad, and there is no proof that it complied with the statute in this respect, erroneous instruction of the trial judge that the railroad should keep on the lookout ahead by the engineer and the fireman is harmless, and does not constitute reversible error. Railroad v. Wyrick, 99 Tenn. 500, 42 S.W. 434, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 59 (1897).

       Where the engineer did not look ahead nor blow the whistle, though, had he looked, he could have seen plaintiff's decedent 150 feet away and could have warned him of his danger, the railroad company is liable. Southern Ry. v. Cooper, 245 F. 857, 1917 U.S. App. LEXIS 1555 (6th Cir. 1917).

      <p>
       Where the engineer was on the side of the locomotive on the outside of the curve, and was unable to see the deceased who could have been seen by the fireman, if he had not been engaged in shoveling coal into the fire box, it was held that the railroad was not negligent under the statute in not providing for a lookout, either by the engineer or fireman, or by a third person charged with that undivided duty. Southern Ry. v. Colton, 138 Tenn. 300, 197 S.W. 901, 1917 Tenn. LEXIS 34 (1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a fireman engaged in preparing his “coal boards” so as to be ready to receive coal at the next station, which they were then approaching, is engaged in a necessary duty excusing him from maintaining a lookout, is a question of fact for the jury.

Oct. 14, 1871), overruled in part, McIntyre v. Balentine, 833 S.W.2d 52, 1992 Tenn. LEXIS 336 (Tenn. 1992). See Southern Ry. v. Sutton, 179 F. 471, 1910 U.S. App. LEXIS 4665 (6th Cir. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is established by a long line of decisions that no duty rests upon the agents and servants of the railroad to comply with subdivision (3) until an obstruction appears upon the track in front of the moving train or so near that it will be struck by the train. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “obstruction” as used in this section means that which may obstruct or hinder the free and safe passage of a train or that which may receive an injury or damage if run over by the train. Majestic v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 147 F.2d 621, 1945 U.S. App. LEXIS 2180 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1945).

       If the obstruction does not appear upon the “road,” but merely appears on some other part of the right of way, the statute does not apply, but the principles of the common law are applicable. Louisville N. & G. S. R.R. Co. v. Reidmond, 79 Tenn. 205, 1883 Tenn. LEXIS 44 (1883); Rogers v. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry., 136 F. 573, 1905 U.S. App. LEXIS 4493 (6th Cir. 1905).

       In order to recover under subdivision (3), it must be proved that decedent appeared on the road in front of the engine, as an obstruction thereto, and that the engineer failed to sound the alarm, put on the brakes, and employ every means possible to prevent the accident.

      <p>
       Where plaintiff's decedent was seen on the track by defendant's brakeman the full distance ahead for which physical obstacles permitted a view of the track and the statutory precautions could have been taken to prevent the accident before they were actually put in operation, judgment for plaintiff may be upheld. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P. Ry. v. McIntyre, 215 F. 91, 1914 U.S. App. LEXIS 1229 (6th Cir. 1914).

       Appearance of an obstruction upon the road under this section means appearance on the railroad tracks, or so near thereto as to be within striking distance of the train and not necessarily the public approach or whole road in the orbit of vision of the lookout.

       The rule, if a person seen on the track gets off and out of reach of the train, while under observation, the railroad company is not bound to exercise the statutory precautions specified, although such person may afterward get back on the track and be injured, is applicable only where such person has gone far enough away from the track and under such circumstances as reasonably to indicate his safety.

       A person does not pass out of striking distance of a railroad train, while he is still so close to the track that, having due regard for the instinct of self preservation and the involuntary movements of the body, there is still a reasonable probability or likelihood that he may fall or be thrown against the side of the engine or train as it passes him.

       Where plaintiff's decedent was walking toward an approaching train upon a generally used and commonly considered safe path and part of the train passed him before he went under it and was killed, the railroad company is not liable because of failure to sound the whistle on the engine, apply the brakes and stop the train, since plaintiff's decedent was not an obstruction ahead of the train within the meaning of the statute.

       Where there is no direct evidence of the manner of death, it is reversible error to refuse to give the defendant's request as follows: “If you believe, from the proof, that the deceased never appeared in front of the train, but staggered against some part of the train back of the front of the engine, the plaintiff could not recover.” Nashville, C. & T.P.R.R. v. Egerton, 98 Tenn. 541, 41 S.W. 1035, 1896 Tenn. LEXIS 246 (1896). See Nashville, C. & St. L.R.R. v. Seaborn, 85 Tenn. 391, 4 S.W. 661, 1886 Tenn. LEXIS 63 (1887); Whittaker v.

       Where it was proved that plaintiff's intestate left the station in the night, walking upon the railroad track, and in the morning his body was found in pieces a short distance away, the trunk lying between the rails; that during the time six trains had passed, going in opposite directions; that there were indications that the body had been carried forward and back along the track by the passing trains but there was no direct evidence as to how he came to his death, though there was evidence that he was intoxicated when he left the station, and the engineers and firemen of all the trains testified that they had kept a vigilant lookout, that the headlights were burning, and that none of them saw the man on the track, either living or dead, it was a question for the jury whether deceased had “appeared upon the road,” and whether the railroad company had discharged its duty of maintaining a proper lookout, and had observed the other prescribed precautions. Felton v. Newport, 105 F. 332, 1900 U.S. App. LEXIS 3833 (6th Cir. 1900).

       Evidence that the body of deceased was found on the railroad track was not sufficient to establish a presumption that deceased appeared alive in front of a moving train where nothing else appeared to support such contention.

       Evidence to the effect that deceased started home on a rainy night by a route which either led over a railroad bridge or through a swollen creek beneath the bridge, that the shortest and most logical route led over the bridge, that his mangled body was found 300 feet from the bridge and some six or eight feet from the track, that blood and other remains appeared on the track, that his shoes bore no mud as they would have if he had taken the other route and that a train passed over the track a short time after he started home was sufficient to raise a presumption that defendant appeared on the track as an obstruction.

      </p>
      <p>
       The several precautions need not necessarily be complied with in the order in which they are enumerated in the statute. If, by reason of the suddenness of the appearance of the obstruction upon the track, and the proximity and speed of the train, it is impossible to observe each and all of the precautions, then it is the duty of the engineer, or person in charge, to perform such of the requirements as, under all the circumstances, are best calculated and most effectual to prevent the accident.

       Subdivision (3) applies only when the person or obstruction appears on the track in front of the engine or within lateral striking distance before the collision occurs, and it does not apply where the person first comes within striking distance at a point which the head of the engine has already passed, or at the very instant of the engine's arrival.

       The statute does not specify the number of brakemen that shall be upon the train, and it is not required that there shall be one brakeman to each car. The number of brakemen required is left to the regulations of the railroad companies, provided their regulations are reasonable and in conformity with the general usage and course of business of railroads, and are such as contemplate a compliance with the statute according to its fair import and meaning.

       In order to exempt the railroad from liability for failure to reverse the engine when it would endanger the lives and limbs of persons on the train, it must comply with all the other statutory precautions and must employ all means other than the reversal of the engine to stop the train. Memphis & C.R.R. v. Smith, 56 Tenn. 860, 1872 Tenn. LEXIS 214 (1872); Routon v. Louisville & N.R.R., 1 Shan. 528 (1875); East T., V. & G. R.R. Co. v. Selcer, 75 Tenn. 557, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 152 (1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the reversal of the engine, when in motion, would be injurious or hurtful to its machinery will not excuse the railroad company from complying with the requirement of the law that all possible means shall be employed to stop the train and prevent the accident. East T., V. & G. R.R. Co. v. Selcer, 75 Tenn. 557, 1881 Tenn. LEXIS 152 (1881). See Southern R. Co. v. Brooks, 125 Tenn. 260, 143 S.W. 62, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS 22 (1911).

       The impossibility to check the train before colliding with the obstruction does not excuse nonobservance of the statutory precautions in other respects, where such observance is possible.

       The railroad company, to exonerate itself, must show that not only the specified precautions were observed, but, in addition, that every possible means was employed to stop the train and prevent the accident.

      </p>
      <p>
       The performance of impossibilities in the observance of the statutory precautions will not be required of railroad companies, as, where the accident is unavoidable, its prevention absolutely impossible, and the appearance of the person, animal, or other obstruction upon the road is so sudden and in such close proximity to the engine as to render it impossible, on account of the speed of the train and for want of time, for the railroad company to observe the statutory precautions, the company will be excused, and will not be liable in damages for its failure to perform the impossible thing or to prevent the unavoidable accident.

       The statute does not require impossibilities, and where an obstruction appears upon the track in front of the locomotive or in striking distance thereof, so suddenly that compliance with such precautions is impossible, no liability of the railroad could be predicated on the failure to observe the prescribed precautions.

       Question asked the lookout ahead, whether with vigilance, from his position on the engine as the train was approaching, the object on the track could have been seen by the lookout ahead, is pertinent and competent, where it appears that such lookout was in the best position for seeing ahead at that particular place; but if it appears that some other position on the locomotive was the better one for the lookout ahead at that particular place, such question is not competent, and the rejection of such question put to the lookout in such wrong position is not reversible error. E. T. V. & G. R.R. v. White, 73 Tenn. 540, 1880 Tenn. LEXIS 178 (1880). See Nashville & C.R.R. v. Nowlin, 69 Tenn. 523, 1878 Tenn. LEXIS 131 (1878).

       It is permissible for an engineer after testifying as to what he did to avoid an accident to further testify that he did everything he could do to prevent the accident even though it is an expression of an opinion, but it is not conclusive since it is a question within the exclusive province of the jury. Kennedy v. Southern Ry., 2 Tenn. Civ. App. (2 Higgins) 103 (1911); Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Frakes, 11 Tenn. App. 593, — S.W.2d —, 1928 Tenn. App. LEXIS 14 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1928); Casteel v.

       Where in an action to recover for injuries sustained in a collision between a train and an automobile the evidence was conflicting as to whether or not proper lookout was maintained on the train and whether or not everything possible was done by the engineer of the train to avert the accident, a motion for a directed verdict by the railroad was properly denied.

       A person killed in the nighttime by being struck by railroad cars which were being pushed backward across the street along which he was walking is not chargeable with negligence as a matter of law when it does not appear that he could have seen the light on the approaching cars, or how well the place in which he was walking was lighted, and it appears that a train was passing on another track, which might have prevented him from hearing the car that struck him.

       In action against railroad for death of one alleged to have been killed by train as result of defendant's failure to observe statutory precautions and where defendant's inconsistent theories as to cause of death were countered only by inference drawn from presence of vomit on track, verdict for plaintiff depends upon surmise, speculation and conjecture, no witness in the record having seen decedent alive on defendant's track prior to accident and judgment was therefore reversed and case dismissed. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Sutton, 21 Tenn. App. 31, 104 S.W.2d 834, 1936 Tenn. App. LEXIS 68 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 25, 1936).

       The language of this section is explicit and certain, the railroad must show strict compliance with the statute to absolve itself of negligence and even contributory negligence on the part of a person injured does not excuse a strict compliance.

       Where a person going in the same direction as a train stepped aside to allow it to pass and then stepped back on the track and was run over by a detached portion of the train that had broken loose from the front part and it is alleged that there were servants of the railroad company on the detached part of the train, who, had they been on the lookout could have and ought to have warned intestate in time to have averted the accident, the question of defendant's negligence should have been submitted to the jury notwithstanding there was no allegation that intestate looked and listened before stepping back on the track.

       A failure to observe the statute, though not the proximate cause of the injury, renders the company liable, although it may appear that the accident or collision would have occurred had the precautions been observed, and even though the negligence of the plaintiff was the direct and proximate cause.

       The purpose of this statute is not so much to punish an offending engineer as to prevent engineers and trainmen, when using their eyes and ears and all of the safety appliances available, from running their trains or engines together at a crossing.

       It is not per se contributory negligence to halt a train on a railroad crossing, in accordance with long mutual acquiescence, at a point where two railroads cross each other, where a collision thereupon follows through failure of an approaching train to stop, as required by statute, before crossing, by reason of defective brakes, and such halting on the crossing will not prevent the company so halting from recovering damages for injury to one of its cars, caused by the approaching and colliding train. Louisville & N.R.R. v. East Tenn., V. & G. Ry., 60 F. 993, 1894 U.S. App. LEXIS 2149 (6th Cir. 1894).

       A street railway company cannot escape liability for injuries to its passenger resulting from a collision with a railroad train on a crossing, where the street car conductor was lacking in ordinary care in not making sure of the nonapproach of a railroad train before attempting to cross, upon the ground that those in charge of the railroad train were negligent in running over the street railway crossing. Memphis S. R. Co. v. Cavell, 135 Tenn. 462, 187 S.W. 179, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 39, 1918C Am. Ann. Cas. 42 (1916).

        Former section providing for licensing of motor transportation agents and motor freight brokers and requiring bonds of applicants for license to cover losses under contracts and negligent operation of vehicles does not violate Tenn. Const., art. I, § 8, or U.S. Const., amend. 14, since the general assembly, in its discretion and in exercise of the police power, can regulate any occupation or business, if the occupation or business has inherent within it the germs of fraud or danger to public safety.

       <p>
        This section is not violative of Tenn. Const., art. II, § 17, as containing a provision in the body of the act which is not indicated by the caption; since the word “regulation” used in caption includes the provision in the body of the act requiring a permit to operate trucks upon public highways.

       </p>
       <p>
        Former section regulating use of public highways of state by common and contract carriers was not unconstitutional on the ground that caption did not indicate that contract haulers were required to obtain a permit issued only under certain conditions, since neither contract nor common carriers had an unqualified right to use public highways for profit.

        The general rule that state courts may grant injunctive relief against carriers applies not only to intrastate but also interstate carriers, and such equity jurisdiction as to intrastate carriers was not superseded by the statutes relating to the Tennessee public service commission, but was supplemented by this section, and neither was such jurisdiction as to interstate carriers superseded by the Interstate Commerce Act.

      <ol class="alpha">
       <li id="t65c15s65-15-103ol2a">
        In 1980, the United States Congress passed legislation deregulating the rates charged by motor carriers for transporting recyclable materials. This legislation is codified at Title 49, United States Code, Section 10733.
       </li>
       <li id="t65c15s65-15-103ol2b">
        As a result of this congressional action, the rates for interstate transportation of recyclable materials are established through direct negotiation between the motor carrier and the shippers.
       </li>
       <li id="t65c15s65-15-103ol2c">
        When recyclable materials are transported within the State of Tennessee, however, the rates for such intrastate transportation are established by the motor carrier and are filed as binding tariffs with the Public Service Commission.
       </li>
       <li id="t65c15s65-15-103ol2d">
        The rates charged for interstate transportation of recyclable materials are consistently lower than the rates charged for intrastate transportation of recyclable materials.
       </li>
       <li id="t65c15s65-15-103ol2e">
        Because the State of Tennessee is firmly committed to policies which will promote recycling, it is important to lower the costs associated with recycling whenever possible. The cost of transporting recyclable materials, is one of the largest costs associated with recycling.”

         Exemption granted to any motor vehicle while used in the transportation of petroleum products when the owner, lessee, or bailee of the vehicle is legally and regularly engaged in the business of selling or distributing such petroleum products transported on such vehicles was not unconstitutional as creating an unreasonable classification. Gasoline Transp., Inc. v. Crozier, 210 Tenn. 96, 355 S.W.2d 98, 1962 Tenn. LEXIS 396 (1962).

        <p>
         Although former subsection (e) (now subdivision (a)(19)) is unclear, it is not void for internal inconsistency or vagueness: the predominant intention of the legislature was to enact a grandfather clause, allowing carriers operating on May 17, 1971 to continue to operate under grandfather certificates of public convenience and necessity, but subject to future regulation by the public service commission as to safety rules and regulations, inspection of vehicles, etc. Fleet Transp. Co. v. Tennessee Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 545 S.W.2d 4, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 615 (Tenn. 1976).
        </p>
        <p>
         Former subsection (e) (now subdivision (a)(7)) does not constitute invidious class legislation: this 1975 statute is no more than a belated grandfather clause to the 1971 enactment and any carrier in the state coming within its terms and making timely application could obtain its benefits. Fleet Transp. Co. v. Tennessee Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 545 S.W.2d 4, 1976 Tenn. LEXIS 615 (Tenn. 1976).

         Private act regulating taxicab business in city did not suspend general law regulating motor vehicles, since vehicles used exclusively for taxicabs are excluded from the provisions of the general law. Large v. Elizabethton, 185 Tenn. 156, 203 S.W.2d 907, 1947 Tenn. LEXIS 315 (1947).

         Where motor carrier operator came within subsection (d) (now subdivision (a)(13)) of this section and thus was not required to carry liability insurance as provided by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c15s65-15-115ol1c" target="_self">65-15-115(c)</a></cite>, operator was not liable for injuries to trespassing plaintiff who fell from wagon being drawn to the railroad by tractor driven by operator's employee who permitted plaintiff to ride on wagon contrary to operator's instructions. Ball v. Whitaker, 47 Tenn. App. 677, 342 S.W.2d 67, 1960 Tenn. App. LEXIS 101 (1960).

        In granting certificates of convenience and necessity, the commission (now authority) sits as an administrative body and not a court and after hearing proof reaches its decision giving predominant consideration to the convenience and necessity of the people of the state and not to the individual applicants and protestants. Blue Ridge Transp. Co. v. Pentecost, 208 Tenn. 94, 343 S.W.2d 903, 1961 Tenn. LEXIS 399 (1961).

       <p>
        The question of service being furnished is simply one of the elements to be considered by the commission (now authority) along with all other pertinent facts in determining whether or not a certificate should issue. Refiners Transp. Co. v. Pentecost, 204 Tenn. 694, 325 S.W.2d 267, 1959 Tenn. LEXIS 328 (1959).

       <p>
        In absence of material, substantial proof to the contrary, the commission may bring to bear and act upon its own expert knowledge and information, but in such cases the commission (now authority) should summarize the same in its findings so that it will be available for court review.

        It is the convenience and necessity of the people of the state that must be given predominant consideration by the commission (now authority) and not that of contending motor carriers operating over the highways.

        The fact that a bus company held a certificate of convenience and necessity to operate over a state highway running through the city did not preclude the city from regulating and controlling its streets with reference to the use of them by buses, and an ordinance prohibiting the loading and unloading of passengers on the streets by buses is valid.

        Where electric railroad company merely substituted buses for trolley cars, the company was not engaging in a new and independent project but such change was in the nature of an improvement and more modern substitute for former electric cars over practically the same route, and the commission in approving such change was not making an original grant of privilege but merely approving the substitution of a new means of transportation in the exercise of the old privilege.

        On appeal from proceedings in chancery by certiorari to have order of the commission granting certificate of convenience and necessity to bus line declared void on ground that it was not supported by material evidence where the evidence in the case fairly covered all the factors set forth in subsections (a) and (b), it was necessary that the Supreme Court assume that the commission gave “reasonable consideration” to such factors. Dunlap v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, 178 Tenn. 532, 160 S.W.2d 413, 1941 Tenn. LEXIS 86 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence before commission was conflicting as to advisability of issuance of certificate of convenience to petitioner, but there was material evidence to support issuance of certificate by commission, the trial court was not entitled to set aside the order of the commission.

        Where an applicant for a certificate of convenience and necessity furnished as financial information only a brief statement of cash available to start a trucking business, the court held that the requirement of this section that full financial information be furnished was mandatory, not directory and that, therefore, the public service commission acted unlawfully in treating this requirement as directory and granting the certificate until the applicant had been given a further opportunity to comply, but since he had relied in good faith on a long standing policy and practice of the commission treating the requirement as directory only, the court did not void the already issued certificate.

        The fact that the former commission's regulation postpones the attachment of liability until the rendition of a final judgment against the insured does not discharge or lessen its statutory duty “to make compensation” — it merely fixes the time when that liability shall accrue.

       The statute is not unconstitutional as depriving the original purchaser of a property right without due process of law. Samuelson v. State, 116 Tenn. 470, 95 S.W. 1012, 115 Am. St. Rep. 805, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 10, 115 Am. St. Rep. 805 (1906).

       The statute, in its application to nontransferable signature passenger tickets for passage from Tennessee into another state, is not invalid as an unwarranted interference with interstate commerce or interstate passenger travel. Samuelson v. State, 116 Tenn. 470, 95 S.W. 1012, 115 Am. St. Rep. 805, 1906 Tenn. LEXIS 10, 115 Am. St. Rep. 805 (1906).

      <p>
       The statute is not unconstitutional as class legislation suspending a general law for the benefit of particular individuals, because it is in the proper exercise of the police power.

        Telecommunications company's rights-of-way for its telephone lines through defendant city's property was granted by state law so, although pursuant to its police power, the city could charge a fee reasonably related to the cost to the city for the use and maintenance of the rights-of-way, the city could not tax the telecommunications company for the use of the rights-of-way; however, the record indicated that the revenue derived from the alleged fee was allocated to different city functions and apparently bore no relation to the cost to the city in supervising and regulating the use of the rights-of-way, so the appellate court found that the ordinance enacted was invalid as contrary to the state statutes and reversed the chancery court's contrary decision.

        Trial court did not err in holding that a city was entitled to compensation pursuant to a franchise agreement because a telecommunication services provider knew and agreed from the beginning it would have to pay fees; because the ordinance that set the rate later was held invalid did not mean the city exceeded its authority in establishing a fee in the first place.

       Every telephone company doing business within this state, and engaged in a general telephone business, shall supply all applicants for telephone connection and facilities, without discrimination or partiality; provided, that such applicants comply or offer to comply with the reasonable regulations of the company. No such company shall impose any condition or restriction upon any such applicant that is not imposed impartially upon all persons or companies in like situations, nor shall such company discriminate against any individual or company engaged in lawful business by requiring, as condition for furnishing such facilities, that they shall not be used in the business of the applicant or otherwise, under penalty of one hundred dollars ($100) for each day such company continues such discrimination and refuses such facilities after compliance or offer to comply with the reasonable regulations, and time to furnish the same has elapsed, to be recovered by the applicant whose application is so neglected or refused.

Cumberland Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Kelly, 160 F. 316, 1908 U.S. App. LEXIS 4187 (6th Cir. 1908); Home Tel. Co. v. People's Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 125 Tenn. 270, 141 S.W. 845, 1911 Tenn.

        This section merely recognizes the common law obligation of telephone companies to furnish undiscriminating service, and enforces this obligation by a penalty in the nature of punitive damages, recoverable in a civil action brought by the person against whom there has been a wrongful discrimination.

        Where the applicant demands a residence telephone and tenders the amount of the rental required under the rules of the company, it cannot lawfully refuse to put in the telephone upon the ground of its mere apprehension that the applicant may use the telephone as a business telephone. The time for the company to make its objection will be when the applicant uses his residence telephone as a business telephone. Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v.

        A telephone company having agreed to furnish a prospective patron a telephone in his home, and declining to install it until he paid three months' rental in advance, in accordance with its general rule, is not guilty of illegal discrimination. Such a corporation can extend credit, for service rendered, to one or more of its patrons, and exact payment in advance from others, without being guilty of illegal discrimination among its patrons. Vaught v. East Tenn. Tel. Co., 123 Tenn. 318, 130 S.W. 1050, 1910 Tenn. LEXIS 6, 31 L.R.A. (n.s.) 315 (1910).

        The rule that telephone and telegraph companies are common carriers of intelligence, and must give the same service on the same terms to all who apply therefor, without partiality or unreasonable discrimination, does not mean that a telephone company is bound to permit another telephone company to make a physical connection with its lines and switchboards, for the purpose of using them as its own subscribers use them; and such connection can be enforced neither under the common law nor under the statute. Home Tel. Co. v. People's Tel. & Tel. Co., 125 Tenn. 270, 141 S.W. 845, 1911 Tenn. LEXIS (n.s.) 23, 43 L.R.A. (n.s.) 550 (Tenn. Sep. 1911).

        A joint traffic arrangement between two telephone companies, giving one of them the right of physical connection with the lines and switchboards of the other, will not confer such right upon other telephone companies not parties to the contract.

        Since this statute has been in existence for more than a quarter of a century, and it has been tacitly treated by the courts, the bar, and the people as constitutional, and many important and valuable rights have been based thereon, nothing could induce the supreme court now to declare it unconstitutional, except the clearest and most undoubted reasons.

        A telegraph company is not protected against the consequences of its negligence in failing to deliver a message, by reason of the fact that it is an instrumentality of and engaged in interstate commerce. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Mellon, 100 Tenn. 429, 45 S.W. 443, 1897 Tenn. LEXIS 133 (1897); Gray v. Western Union Tel. Co., 108 Tenn. 39, 64 S.W. 1063, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 7, 91 Am.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where telegram is to be delivered in this state, sender is entitled to recover damages for breach of the statutory duty, although the company would not be liable for damages under the laws, statutory or common, of the state of sending. Gray v. Western Union Tel. Co., 108 Tenn. 39, 64 S.W. 1063, 1901 Tenn. LEXIS 7, 91 Am. St. Rep. 706, <cite class="lra">56 L.R.A. 301</cite> (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the act of congress of June 18, 1910, ch. 309, congress has occupied the field with respect to interstate telegrams, and state regulations and decisions no longer govern as to the validity of contractual limitations of liability. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Schade, 137 Tenn. 214, 192 S.W. 924, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1916); Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v.

       <p>
        Since the act of congress of June 18, 1910, ch. 309, the liability of the common law carrier of telegrams for mental suffering is controlled by the federal law which superseded the state regulations and decisions ad hoc. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Schade, 137 Tenn. 214, 192 S.W. 924, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1916).

       <p>
        Prior to the Federal Communications Act (47 U.S.C., § 151 et seq.), in this state one aggrieved by failure of a telegraph company to promptly transmit a message might sue in tort and recover all natural damages or approximate damages flowing from such failure, and in such a suit in tort it was not necessary that the telegraph company should have notice of the purpose of the message and the nature of the transaction to which it related.

        A stipulation upon the blank on which a telegram is written and received, exempting the telegraph company from liability for damages in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within 60 days after the filing or sending of the message, is a reasonable and valid contract. Manier & Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 94 Tenn. 442, 29 S.W. 732, 1894 Tenn. LEXIS 57 (1894); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Mellon, 96 Tenn. 66, 33 S.W. 725, 1895 Tenn.

       <p>
        In an action for damages against a telegraph company for error in transmission of messages, it was error to confine the plaintiff's recovery to $50.00 and interest, where the telegram was written on a blank piece of paper and so accepted for transmission, and there was nothing showing that it was accepted under conditions that would incorporate, as part of the carrier's contract, the limitation clauses appearing in print on the back of the telegraph blanks in general use. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Schade, 137 Tenn. 214, 192 S.W. 924, 1916 Tenn. LEXIS 73 (1916).

        The institution of suit and service of process may operate as a presentation of a claim for damages when the process is served within the specified time and contains the essentials of a formal notice of claim for damages, or when the declaration giving such information is filed within the stipulated time. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Mellon, 96 Tenn. 66, 33 S.W. 725, 1895 Tenn. LEXIS 10 (1895); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Courtney, 113 Tenn. 482, 82 S.W. 484, 1904 Tenn. LEXIS 38 (1904); Western Union Tel.

        It is proper for the plaintiff to show that he sent a second telegram to the company's operator at the point of destination urging prompt delivery of the previous telegram, and this is true whether, as a matter of fact, the second telegram filed with the company's agent was or was not actually transmitted.

        A telegraph company is under no legal obligation to deliver a telegram to the addressee at his residence beyond the place of destination of the message, and three and a half miles in the country therefrom, where the message is delivered to and taken by the receiving operator for transmission, without notice that the addressee so resided, and where the charges were neither paid nor guaranteed for delivering a message at such residence.

        Where a plainly and distinctly written message is delivered to a telegraph company for transmission, as an unrepeated message, and such mistake is made in its transmission that it reaches a connecting line, after passing over only a single line, in a materially altered condition, there is, in the absence of explanation on the part of the telegraph company, sufficient evidence of negligence to justify a recovery.

        A telegraph company is negligent in transmitting and delivering a telegram, addressed by a lawyer to his client, inquiring whether the client desired attachment of his failing debtor's property and requesting a prompt answer, where the message was received by the company about nine o'clock in the morning, and was not delivered until between six and seven o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, without other excuse for the delay than that the messenger boy, finding the addressee's business house temporarily closed, left the message for him with a reputable neighbor, who paid the charges and undertook to deliver it.

        The initial telegraph company is not liable for its negligence in changing the given name of the addressee of a message in transmitting it to the connecting line, because the damages do not, naturally and proximately, result from such negligence, where such change in name did not occasion the delay in its delivery to the proper person, and where it appears that the connecting line received the message promptly and was not misled by such change in name, but negligently delayed delivery to the proper person.

        The question whether a statutory right to recover some damages for a breach of a statutory duty affords a basis to recover also for injured feelings is a question of general jurisprudence, and not a construction of a state statute by the state court, so that the federal court is not bound by the state court's opinion.

         This section does not bring into existence a contract between the state and a telegraph company which is impaired by a city imposing a charge upon a telegraph company for the use of its streets. It does not nullify the right of a city to demand and receive compensation for the use of its streets by a telegraph company for the erection of poles and wires. Memphis v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., 145 F. 602, 1906 U.S. App. LEXIS 4010 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1906).

        <p>
         Telecommunications company's rights-of-way for its telephone lines through defendant city's property was granted by state law so, although pursuant to its police power, the city could charge a fee reasonably related to the cost to the city for the use and maintenance of the rights-of-way, the city could not tax the telecommunications company for the use of the rights-of-way; however, the record indicated that the revenue derived from the alleged fee was allocated to different city functions and apparently bore no relation to the cost to the city in supervising and regulating the use of the rights-of-way, so the appellate court found that the ordinance enacted was invalid as contrary to the state statutes and reversed the chancery court's contrary decision.

         Granting that a county court can, under the police power, require a telephone company to pay a pole rent for its poles erected along the public highways, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of supervision and inspection, a resolution of the county court making such payments necessary only on failure to comply with certain requirements, could not be considered such an exercise of the police power.

         A petition by a telegraph company for condemnation for a telegraph line upon a railroad right of way, brought under the statute but providing that the ordinary use of such railroad shall not be thereby obstructed, is not bad because the petition declared that the telegraph line would not obstruct the use of the railroad right of way for railroad purposes, and offered to move the line in case the railroad right of way should become obstructed.

        <p>
         A railroad company is entitled to only nominal damages for the use of its right of way through an agricultural section of the country by a telegraph line for its posts and wires, where the use and occupation of such railroad's right of way for railroad purposes is not interfered with or encumbered in any way.

        </p>
        <p>
         A telegraph line on a railroad's right of way may interfere so slightly with the railroad's use as to indicate only nominal damages, and it may be a material interference to the point of indicating substantial damages, and it may reach the degree of obstruction justifying a denial of the condemnation to the telegraph company. The railroad cannot be denied substantial damages where the taking will force it, in case it erects its own telegraph line, to adopt a less advantageous route; and this is so, though the telegraph company offered to remove its line in case it should become an obstruction, for a slight interference would not amount to an obstruction.

       This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Rural Electric and Community Services Cooperative Act.”

         The general assembly finds that rural electric cooperatives, since their inception fifty (50) years ago, have proved to be ideal business organizations in providing adequate and reliable electric services at reasonable rates throughout the rural communities of Tennessee. There are growing needs and demands for other comparable utility services in Tennessee's rural communities, including the need for television reception and programming services which are already available, for the most part, in the state's urban areas. As proved to be the case in providing electric service in rural communities, it is vital that the area coverage principle be applied in providing other utility services in the more sparsely settled areas of the state. It is, therefore, in the public's best interest that rural electric cooperatives be empowered to provide such services and that new cooperatives may be organized for such purposes.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c25s65-25-101ol1b2">
         The general assembly finds that unfair and unwelcomed efforts may be made in Tennessee, as they recently have in other states, whereby absentee-owned profit power companies will attempt the acquisition of properties and the take-over of the businesses of rural electric cooperatives, and thereby disrupt Tennessee's long-standing and successful policy of providing rural electric services through nonprofit, cooperative organizations. It is, therefore, in the public's best interest that laws affecting such efforts will provide fair and equitable due process procedures and standards so as to ensure that such acquisitions will not be accomplished if inimical to the best interests of the rural citizens who will be affected.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c25s65-25-101ol1b3">
         The general assembly further finds that Tennessee statutes currently governing electric cooperatives have not been comprehensively revised since their initial enactment. It is, therefore, in the public interest that cooperative business organizations, their respective members and the rural communities of the state would be better served by updating such statutes to make them more compatible with changed conditions and to appropriately reconcile such statutes with the new Tennessee Nonprofit Corporation Act, compiled in title 48, chapters 51-68.

      Amendments. The 2017 amendment deleted former (c) which read: “Neither this chapter nor any other law shall be construed to authorize a cooperative to own, operate or otherwise acquire a legal or beneficial interest in a city-franchised or county-franchised cable television system; provided, that each cooperative may, within its service area and with the authorization of its board, contract to establish a cable joint venture with an entity that is a current franchise holder under title 7, chapter 59, within the cooperative's service area and has been operating, either itself or its predecessor franchise holder, for not less than three (3) years at the time of the establishment of the cable joint venture. A cable joint venture shall be authorized to provide cable service, two-way video transmission, video programming, internet services, and other like services and shall comply in all respects with the requirements of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c25s65-25-130" target="_self">65-25-130</a></cite>. The authority to establish a cable joint venture shall not apply to areas served by any existing telephone cooperative that has been providing cable service for not less than ten (10) years under the authority of the federal communications commission.”

     <p>
      The 2018 amendment rewrote (a)(11) which read: “With respect to a primary purpose and the secondary purpose of supplying telecommunications services, but without limiting the generality or particularity of subdivisions (a)(1)-(10), construct, maintain, and operate electric and/or other telecommunication transmission and distribution lines or other conducting or communications facilities along, upon, under, and across all public thoroughfares, including, without limitation, all roads, highways, streets, alleys, bridges, and causeways, and upon, under, and across all publicly owned lands; provided, that the respective authorities having jurisdiction thereover shall consent thereto; provided, however, that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned or withheld or conditioned for the purpose of enabling such an authority to gain competitive advantage with respect to the rendition by itself or any other entity of a service which the cooperative also has a right to render; and”.

     <p>
      The 2019 amendment, in (d)(1) and (d)(2), substituted “are not” for “shall not be”; in (d)(1) and (d)(3), substituted “excess receipts” for “voluntary contributions”; in (d)(1), substituted “may” for “shall have the power and authority to”, and substituted “the amount of any excess receipt due to rounding” for “such contribution”; in (d)(2), substituted “Excess receipts” for “Contributions”, substituted “the cooperative may” for “shall be used”, and inserted “use the excess receipts”;  in (d)(3), inserted a comma following “disability”; and added (d)(4)–(d)(6).

       Tennessee State Board of Equalization properly recalculated the electric cooperatives'  annual ad valorem taxes for 2015 and recertified the assessments because, as the Attorney General correctly found, the statutory tax exemption for electric cooperatives was unconstitutional where there was no element of charity associated with electric cooperatives, the statutory exemption was incompatible with the statutory charitable exemption framework, the exemption appeared to be a mechanism to recoup expenses of construction, and the language of the exemption itself would seem to indicate it was not a charitable exemption due to the limitation of the exemption to four years.

       The right to lay pipes in the public highway is itself a franchise and the right of eminent domain cannot be conferred except for taking private property for public use, and for these two reasons among others water and waterworks companies have always been held to be public utilities.

         It is recognized by the general assembly that the provision of dependable and economical sources of energy is vital to the health, welfare and economic well-being of the citizens and residents of the state and that one of the primary sources of energy in this state is natural gas. The general assembly further recognizes world supplies of natural gas are limited and that the market for natural gas has undergone major changes in recent years due to increasing demand. It is recognized by the general assembly that the primary constituent of natural gas is methane, and that methane is generated by the natural decomposition of materials deposited in solid waste landfills. Landfill methane is produced in landfills together with other gaseous materials, but the methane may be extracted, treated, and sold as a substitute for natural gas. It is also recognized by the general assembly that, if not utilized for a natural gas substitute or other energy or commercial use, the landfill methane may constitute a pollutant if released into the atmosphere; and, in certain instances under state and federal environmental laws, the landfill methane must be collected and destroyed and the commercial value of the landfill methane would then be wasted. In order to ensure that all persons have the flexibility and power to compete for and obtain methane from landfill gas and treat landfill gas for substitution for natural gas on terms that will result in continuing availability of both natural gas and landfill methane at reasonable rates to the citizens and residents of the state, and to encourage the reduction or elimination of atmospheric pollution that may occur if the landfill methane were allowed to be introduced into the atmosphere, it is the intent of the general assembly by this part to:

       This section contemplates three possible hearings in consideration of an application for a certificate of public convenience, an initial hearing at which the sole issue is the adequacy of existing service, and then, if the commission (now authority) determines that service is inadequate and gives notice to existing carrier to provide reasonably adequate service, a second hearing at which the sole issue is existing carrier's compliance with the commission's (now authority's) order, and finally, if the commission determines that there has not been compliance with its directive, a third hearing to determine the ability of the applicant to perform efficiently the service for which authority is requested.

       The legislative intent was for the commission (now authority) to authorize a single grant of authority to one radio common carrier at a time, regardless of whether the market is open or established.

       The only express limitation on the number of grants of authority in the Radio Common Carrier Act is found in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c30s65-30-105ol1f" target="_self">65-30-105(f)</a></cite> which allows the commission (now authority) to grant a certificate to a radio common carrier applying for authority to operate in an established service area only after a determination that the existing service is inadequate and the provider of the existing service refuses or is unable to meet the public's need after a hearing on reasonable notice.

      </p>
      <p>
       The consideration of whether a radio common carrier serves a contiguous area is only one factor to be considered in determining whether a certificate shall be issued. Because certificates may still be issued to applicants that are not operating in a contiguous area, no closed class is created, and T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c30s65-30-105" target="_self">65-30-105</a></cite> is constitutional.

      </p>

       The Radio Common Carrier Act does not prohibit competition, but merely limits the number of applicants that can be granted authority at one time in a particular area, rather than the number of total entries allowed.

       The commission (now authority) acted within the authority of this chapter when it imposed upon the transfer of certificates of public convenience the condition that so long as one company owned both the land line telephone company and the only radio common carrier service in a particular area, the commission (now authority) could conclude that entry into that market by another radio common carrier would not be a duplication of service. Dial-A-Page, Inc. v. Bissell, 823 S.W.2d 202, 1991 Tenn. App. LEXIS 453 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991).

      <p>
       Public service commission's (now authority's) decision with respect to the award of the certificate of convenience and necessity to paging company for the Knoxville area was supported by substantial and material evidence where it considered all the statutory factors, including the public need for paging services, the suitability of the applicants, the financial responsibility of the applicants, and their ability to efficiently perform the services.

       Evidence supported the public service commission's (now authority's) determination that the advantage to the paging customers in the Knoxville area would be best served by awarding the certificate of necessity to paging company, although paging company would finance their service with debt, instead of other company who would probably finance the service with equity funds; there is nothing in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c30s65-30-105" target="_self">65-30-105</a></cite> that requires a certificate to be given the applicant with the most funds.

     <p>
      The utility governing body, in conjunction with the utility management team, shall establish a policy governing the discontinuation of service for nonpayment of service. The policy must be in compliance with service practice standards and best practices for similarly situated utilities.

      Amendments. The 2019 amendment rewrote the section which read: “(a)  A utility shall not discontinue service to a user for nonpayment of services until:“(1)  A notice has been mailed to the user stating that service shall be discontinued unless payment is made within a specified time; and“(2)  A reasonable, good faith effort is made to notify the user by a utility representative in person that service shall be discontinued on a date certain. Placing a telephone call or sending electronic mail by the utility representative constitutes a reasonable good faith effort; provided, however, that the utility representative need not place a telephone call or send electronic mail to any residence where service has been discontinued within the previous four (4) years.“(b)  After such notification procedures have been taken and a user does not make payment of the arrearage or make payment arrangements acceptable to the utility, then service to such user may be discontinued.”

A solar electricity generating facility that comes within the statutory definition of “public electric system” is prohibited from selling power in certain geographical territories.  Whether its property is “affected by and dedicated to public use” will depend on a variety of factors, specific to each case.  The fact that it provides power “directly and exclusively to owners and/or tenants located on the same or adjacent premises” is just one of many factors to be considered but is not alone determinative of whether or not its property is affected by and dedicated to public use.   If the owner of a solar electricity generating facility is a public electric system as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c34s65-34-102ol15" target="_self">65-34-102(5)</a></cite>, it would likewise be a public utility as defined in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c04s65-4-101ol16A" target="_self">65-4-101(6)(A)</a></cite> unless it were to come within one of the many statutory exceptions detailed in T.C.A. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t65c04s65-4-101ol16Ai" target="_self">65-4-101(6)(A)(i)</a></cite> through (B)(ii).  OAG 17-25, 2017 Tenn.

       Price differences among retail telecommunications customers shall be strictly prohibited, to the extent that such differences are attributable to race, creed, color, religion, sex or national origin. All other differences in pricing among retail telecommunications customers, as of May 28, 2005, shall be presumed to be a function of the competitive market. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence of price discrimination as prohibited by state law.

This chapter does not confer jurisdiction on the commission relating to services outside its jurisdiction as of May 28, 2005.

Except as provided in this section, the commission shall not assert regulatory jurisdiction over the retail offering of combinations or bundles of products or services, whether or not such combinations or bundles of products or services are subject to a tariff or other regulatory filing with the commission as of May 28, 2005, and whether or not comprised of products or services provided by a local exchange carrier alone or with another company.

Scripts for these announcements shall be posted for comments from industry and consumers or their representatives before being used and shall not favor any one provider or technology over others.

If no term was selected by the end-user for a combination or bundle of products or services, or if no term limit applied to such combination or bundle, then the terms and conditions governing that combination or bundle of products or services, at the time the end-user subscribed, shall remain in effect until the end-user agrees or elects otherwise or until the end-user is noticed of a change in terms by the service provider. Terms and conditions originally established by approved tariffs, which are changed and noticed to customers subsequent to May 28, 2005, shall bind end-users. End-users who terminate service within thirty (30) days of issuance of the notice of a change in such terms and conditions shall not be affected by such changed terms and conditions for the period between issuance of the notice and termination of service.
