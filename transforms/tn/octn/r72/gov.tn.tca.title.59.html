          Notwithstanding the restrictions placed upon the owner in the selection of his mine foreman, the latter is to be considered the employee of the owner or operator, and the doctrine of respondeat superior applies in case miner is injured by reason of the foreman's negligence.

   The argument that the foreman is required to give all his time to his statutory duties, and that, since he would have no time remaining for performance of duties directed by the owner or operator, it must be assumed that he is subject to no such duties, and since the owner cannot control the foreman in his statutory duties, the owner has no power to control the foreman at all, and that therefore the former cannot be held liable for the latter's acts under the doctrine of respondeat superior, is not controlling as against the provisions of §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t59c04s59-4-302" target="_self">59-4-302</a></cite> making the foreman the owner's agent.

The advertisement is considered part of any bond release application and shall contain a notification of the precise location of the land affected, the number of acres, the permit number and the date that the permit was approved, the amount of the bond filed and the portion of the bond sought to be released, the type and appropriate dates of reclamation work performed, and a description of the results achieved as the results relate to the operator's approved plan.

The evaluation shall consider, but not be limited to, the degree of difficulty to complete or evaluate any remaining reclamation, whether pollution or diminution of surface or subsurface water is occurring, the probability of continuation of the pollution or diminution, and the estimated cost of abating or correcting it. The commissioner shall notify the permittee in writing of the commissioner's decision to release or not to release all or part of the performance bond or deposit within sixty (60) days from the filing of the request, if no public hearing is held, and if a public hearing is held, within thirty (30) days after the hearing date.

The remaining bond shall be held for at least five (5) years after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work to assure that all reclamation requirements have been successfully met. A portion of the remaining bond may be released prior to the elapsing of five (5) years in accordance with board rules.

When a silt dam or impoundment approved as part of the mining or reclamation plan is to be retained as a permanent impoundment pursuant to § 59-8-110, the portion of the bond may be released under subdivision (d)(1) so long as the silt dam or impoundment meets the post-mining land use criteria and water quality and quantity concerns, and provisions for sound future maintenance by the permittee or the landowner have been made with the commissioner.

A civil penalty assessed under this subsection (a) shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of assessing a civil penalty. In determining the amount of the penalty, the commissioner shall consider the history of previous violations by the operator, permittee, or person at the particular coal surface mining operation; the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any danger to the health or safety of the public; whether the operator, permittee, or person was negligent; and the demonstrated good faith of the operator, permittee, or person charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. If notice of a proposed assessment is not provided as part of a complaint or cease and desist order pursuant to § 59-8-116, then the commissioner shall give notice of a proposed assessment by certified mail return receipt requested as provided in § 59-8-116(d)(2) within thirty (30) days of the date the complaint or order is served. If an appeal from the notice of proposed assessment is not made to the commissioner or the board as provided in subsection (b) or (c) by the operator, permittee, or person within thirty (30) days of service of the notification of the proposed assessment, the operator, permittee, or person is deemed to have consented to the assessment, and the assessment shall become final.

If, through administrative or judicial review of the proposed violation or penalty, the board, chancellor, or judge determines that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty should be reduced, the commissioner shall, within thirty (30) days of the determination, remit the applicable escrowed amount to the operator, permittee, or person with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum, or at the prevailing department of treasury rate, whichever is greater.

   Attorney General Opinions. The Governor’s efforts to submit requests for federal funding and applications to obtain exclusive jurisdiction over surface mining and reclamation operations  do not constitute “implementation” of part  1 of chapter 8, title 59, of the Tennessee Code and are not subject to the availability of federal funds under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t59c08s59-8-133ol1a" target="_self">59-8-133(a)</a></cite>. The cost of implementation and enforcement must be paid by equal amounts of federal funds and money in the coal mining protection fund. If no federal funds are available, then no money from the coal mining protection fund may be spent because such an expenditure would not be in “equal proportion” to the amount of federal funds spent.

   Attorney General Opinions. The Governor’s efforts to submit requests for federal funding and applications to obtain exclusive jurisdiction over surface mining and reclamation operations  do not constitute “implementation” of part  1 of chapter 8, title 59, of the Tennessee Code and are not subject to the availability of federal funds under T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t59c08s59-8-133ol1a" target="_self">59-8-133(a)</a></cite>. The cost of implementation and enforcement must be paid by equal amounts of federal funds and money in the coal mining protection fund. If no federal funds are available, then no money from the coal mining protection fund may be spent because such an expenditure would not be in “equal proportion” to the amount of federal funds spent. OAG 18-26, 2018 Tenn. AG LEXIS 26 (6/27/2018).

   In a nuisance action brought by the state against a company concerning its use of mineral rights to extract sandstone from property in which the state held the surface rights, trial court erred by granting the company's motion for summary judgment and holding that the term “minerals” as used in the deed unambiguously included sandstone for purposes of T.C.A. §<cite class="octn"><a href="#t59c08s59-8-202ol17B" target="_self">59-8-202(7)(B)</a></cite>; court of appeals held that the deed could not be read as waiving the surface owner's right to use the property for its reasonable or intended purpose, and the company failed to demonstrate the absence of a disputed issue of material fact on the question of whether its mining techniques were impermissibly destructive.

            The general assembly finds that the unregulated surface mining of minerals can cause soil erosion and landslides, stream pollution, and accumulation and seepage of contaminated water; contributes to floods; impairs the value of land for agricultural or other purposes; affects fish and wildlife and their habitats; counteracts efforts for the conservation of soil, water and other natural resources; impairs the owners' rights in neighboring property; creates fire hazards; and in general creates conditions inimical to life, property and the public welfare so as to require the exercise of the state's police power in the regulation of surface mining. The general assembly further finds that there are wide variations in the circumstances and conditions surrounding and arising out of the surface mining of minerals due primarily to differences in topographical, geological, and soil conditions, by reason of which it is necessary, in order to provide the most effective, beneficial and equitable solution to the problem, that broad discretion be placed in the authority designated to administer and enforce the regulatory provisions enacted by the general assembly. It is the purpose of this part, therefore, to provide for such regulation and control of surface mining so as to minimize its injurious effects.

             The language that the proceeds from the forfeiture of a bond shall be “used to the extent required in completing reclamation and revegetation” of the area with respect to which the bond was posted indicated that the legislature contemplated that some amount would remain after the proceeds of the forfeited bond had been used to reclaim the land for which the bond was posted. This would not be true if the state were to recover only the amount necessary for reclamation or only the amount of damages it had suffered because of noncompliance. State v. Gulf American Fire & Casualty Co., 680 S.W.2d 455, 1984 Tenn. LEXIS 876 (Tenn. 1984).

               The purpose of this part is to establish a regulatory program which will allow coal surface mining as defined herein for operations which are exempt from the jurisdiction of the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq.) consistent with adequate environmental safeguards; except this part is not intended to regulate coal surface mining operations where less than twenty-five (25) tons of coal are removed within twelve (12) successive calendar months in any one (1) location regardless of the size of the area affected.

               The general assembly finds that although the surface mining of coal on operations disturbing two (2) surface acres or less within this state provides a significant present source of energy and employment, the proper control of surface mining of coal, so as to minimize or prevent adverse disruptions and the injurious effects thereof, requires thorough planning in selection of appropriate coal surface mining sites, methods of coal surface mining and the nature and extent of reclamation; consideration of the impact of coal surface mining upon the ecology and land use of surrounding areas as well as upon the disturbed land of the coal surface mining site; and the incorporation and use of control techniques and reclamation actions as an integral and simultaneous part of coal surface mining.

      <p>
       The Interstate Mining Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       ARTICLE I.  Finding and Purposes
      </p>
      <ol class="alpha">
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1a">
        The party states find that:
        <ol>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1a1">
          Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance;
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1a2">
          The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public;
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1a3">
          Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly, and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern;
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1a4">
          Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land or the development of mineral and other natural resources, but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated; and
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1a5">
          The states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1b">
        The purposes of this compact are to:
        <ol>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1b1">
          Advance the protection and restoration of land, water and other resources affected by mining;
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1b2">
          Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to mining;
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1b3">
          Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated;
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1b4">
          Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources; and
         </li>
         <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol1b5">
          Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       ARTICLE II.  Definitions
      </p>
      <p>
       As used in this compact, the term:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol21">
        “Mining” means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location, and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use; but does not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on-site farming or construction; and
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol22">

       ARTICLE III.  State Programs
      </p>
      <p>
       Each party state agrees that within a reasonable time it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol31">
        The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations;
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol32">
        The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and water;
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol33">
        The institution and maintenance of suitable programs for adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands; and
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol34">
        The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past and future.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       ARTICLE IV.  Powers
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to any other powers conferred upon the interstate mining commission, established by Article V of this compact, such commission shall have power to:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol41">
        Study mining operations, processes and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change;
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol42">
        Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining;
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol43">
        Make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact;

        Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact;
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol45">
        Cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interests in any subject coming within the purview of this compact;
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol46">
        Consult, upon the request of a party state and within resources available therefor, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact;

        Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       ARTICLE V.  The Commission
      </p>
      <ol class="alpha">
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol5a">
        There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the “Interstate Mining Commission,” hereinafter called the “commission.” The commission shall be composed of one (1) commissioner from each party state who shall be the governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of his party state, each governor shall have the assistance of an advisory body (including membership from mining industries, conservation interests, and such other public and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to mining and in discharging his responsibilities as the commissioner of his state on the commission. In any instance where a governor is unable to attend a meeting of the commission or perform any other function in connection with the business of the commission, he shall designate an alternate, from among the members of the advisory body required by this paragraph, who shall represent him and act in his place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the governor to the commission in such manner as its bylaws may provide.
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol5b">
        The commissioners shall be entitled to one (1) vote each on the commission. No action of the commission making a recommendation pursuant to Article IV-3, IV-7, and IV-8 or requesting, accepting or disposing of funds, service, or other property pursuant to this paragraph, Article V(g), V(h), or VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission is cast in favor thereof. All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting, provided that action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners, or their alternates, is present. The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.

      </ol>
      <p>
       ARTICLE VI.  Advisory, Technical, and Regional Committees

        Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one half (½) in equal shares, and the remainder in proportion to the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the commission's budget of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.
       </li>
       <li id="t59c10s59-10-101ol6c">
        The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article V(h) of this compact; provided, that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under Article V(h) hereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.
       </li>

        Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.

       This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

      All corporations organized as subsidiaries and controlled by any coal cooperative association formed in accordance with the laws of this state shall not be considered corporations organized for profit and doing business in Tennessee, or subject to any privilege tax levied by any law as a tax for the privilege of doing business for profit in Tennessee, it being the legislative intent to exempt by this section all such subsidiary corporations controlled by coal cooperative associations, where any and all profits earned by such subsidiary corporations are paid over to or expended for the benefit of such coal cooperative associations, with the result that the activities carried on by such corporations eventually promote and benefit the coal interest of this state.
